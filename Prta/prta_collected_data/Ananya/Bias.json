[{"article": "PHILADELPHIA  —   Forty times, city or state governments had proposed taxes on sugary soft drinks, failing each time. Then, in 2014, liberal Berkeley, Calif. passed such a tax, but most people saw it as an aberration. Several measures, including one in New York, never won much support. But on Thursday, a measure to tax sweetened drinks passed in Philadelphia, one of the country’s largest cities  —   and also one of its poorest. Indeed, raising revenue was the winning argument in Philadelphia. Jim Kenney, the mayor, took a different tack from that of politicians who have tried and failed to pass   taxes. He didn’t talk about the tax as a   measure designed to discourage   soft drinks. And he didn’t promise to earmark the proceeds for health programs. Instead, he cast the soft drink industry as a tantalizing revenue source that could be tapped to fund popular city programs, including universal prekindergarten. “This is the beginning of a process of changing the narrative of poverty in our city,” he said in a news conference after the vote. The advocates who have pushed for the policy say the victory is a sign of growing public acceptance of soft drink taxes and presages more such measures around the country. Though city officials didn’t talk much about the health consequences of soda, experts said that sugary drinks’ increasingly bad reputation made it an appropriate political target. “If we go five years ahead and look back, I think this is going to be a watershed moment,” said Jim Krieger, executive director at Healthy Food America, an organization that is helping cities around the country that are considering soda taxes. “This is going to really provide momentum. ” San Francisco Oakland, Calif. and Boulder, Colo. are considering soft drink taxes this year. Mr. Krieger said the list of interested cities included some that were as large and diverse as Philadelphia. Mr. Kenney said he hadn’t yet spoken directly with officials from other cities, but he had advice for them. “Tie your efforts to tangible initiatives that people care about,” he said in his news conference. “When it comes up, acknowledge that it is a good thing to drink less   beverages, but tie it to things that people care about. ” The Philadelphia tax of 1. 5 cents an ounce will apply to all sugary or artificially sweetened drinks sold by distributors in the city. It is expected to increase prices  —   the tax is about 30 cents for a   drink, or $2. 16 for a  . If passed on to consumers, the increase is expected to substantially reduce sales of sweetened drinks. The city finance department estimates it will raise $91 million a year. Sugary drinks have been linked to health problems, including obesity, diabetes and tooth decay, but the public health effects of the taxes are still unclear. Philadelphia is likely to become the site of public health research. Thomas Farley, the city’s health commissioner, said the city had already planned to measure the tax’s immediate effects on sales.   studies will measure any impact on obesity. The soft drink industry and its allies, including the Teamsters union and local grocers, spent nearly $5 million on lobbying and advertising to fight the tax in Philadelphia. They held rallies and demonstrations downtown and ran   ads on television and the radio, right up until Thursday’s final vote. They branded the drinks tax measure a “grocery tax,” suggesting that more food products were next. The soda industry has argued that Philadelphia’s politics are unusual and that the vote here can’t be seen as predictive. The American Beverage Association, a trade group, has vowed to fight the measure in the courts. “It’s still a bad idea,” said Lauren Kane, a spokeswoman for the group. “People still oppose it. Nothing has changed. ” Thursday, the industry and its allies vented frustration. Daniel Grace, the secretary and treasurer of the Teamsters local, said advocates had “snookered City Council,” and he described the tax as a “brazen cash grab from one industry. ” The promise of prekindergarten energized the city’s education advocates, who joined with public health advocates. The coalition spent about $2 million on advertisements, according to Kevin Feeley, a spokesman for Philadelphians for a Fair Future, a group supporting the tax. That total included $1. 6 million in donations from Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, who has long supported soda taxes. But Mr. Kenney’s focus on revenue also allowed him to help cut deals with skeptical city councilors. Ultimately, the soft drink tax revenue won’t pay just for prekindergarten, but for a host of city programs, reflecting the priorities of the council members who voted for it.", "bias": {"center": 6.086473112547495e-09, "left": 6.221871710074556e-07, "right": 0.9999993717263559}},
{"article": " Samsung, working with consumer safety agencies in South Korea, the US, and China, has temporarily halted sales and production of the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone after reports that replacement devices have caught fire, Yonhap News reported. The company has also asked all owners of both original and replacement Galaxy Note7s to power the phones down and return them. A Samsung spokesperson told BuzzFeed News, “We are temporarily adjusting the Galaxy Note7 production schedule in order to take further steps to ensure quality and safety matters. ” US phone carriers ATT and   stopped selling the phone and declined to issue replacement Note7s for previously sold phones, the Wall Street Journal reported. Both carriers are instead offering refunds or different devices in exchange for returned Note7s. On October 10, Samsung asked “all carriers and retail partners globally to stop sales and exchanges of the Galaxy Note7 while the investigation is taking place. ” Responding to ATT and  ’s decisions, a Samsung spokesperson said, “We are working diligently with authorities and third party experts and will share findings when we have completed the investigation. ” The spokesperson continued, “Even though there are a limited number of reports, we want to reassure customers that we are taking every report seriously. If we determine a product safety issue exists, Samsung will take immediate steps approved by the CPSC to resolve the situation. ” Air carriers have been advising passengers to power down their Note7s during flights for weeks now, but in response to Samsung’s October 10 decision, the Federal Aviation Administration made official recommendations for aircraft passengers “to power down, and not use, charge, or stow in checked baggage, any Samsung Galaxy Note7 devices. ” Last month, Samsung issued a global recall of 2. 5 million Note7s, including 1 million in the US, after a number of reports that the phones’ batteries were overheating and causing them to explode. The electronics manufacturer offered replacement phones to buyers with defective ones, but some users reported that even these burst into flames as well. The Note7 hit the market on Aug. 19, but faced a recall in the US less than a month later on Sept. 15 after nearly 100 reports of the devices catching fire or exploding, some with dramatic results. Replacement phones arrived in the US on Sept. 21 but were met with resistance after a Southwest Airlines flight was grounded because of a smoking Note7. Samsung lost $25 billion in market value due to the multiple failures of the Note7, but shares have recently rebounded to an   high. The Wall Street Journal reported that Samsung’s operating profit will rise to roughly $7 billion in Q3 2016, which includes recall costs of $1 billion. Note7 owners looking to return their phone can start the process here. UPDATE: This story has been updated to reflect Samsung’s request that carriers and sellers cease sales of the Note7 and to include the FAA’s recommendations.

{"article": "A beef between students in Midtown spilled into the streets Wednesday  —   with four teens  stabbed in front of their high school during a bloody, broad daylight brawl, officials said. The fight unfolded outside of PS35 on West 52nd Street near 8th Avenue in Hell’s Kitchen at around 1:20 pm. according to police. “First it was one kid stabbed, then two, then it was three, then four,” recalled a building worker, who was in the area, and asked to not be named.  “There were kids running,” he told The Post. “It was a melee. ” A    boy wound up being stabbed in the stomach and back, a    boy was stabbed in the ear, an    was stabbed in the arm, and another teen was wounded when all was said and done, police sources said. They were each taken to local hospitals and were expected to survive. The victims were all students at PS35, officials said.  Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce explained at a press conference Wednesday afternoon that the    stemmed from an ongoing beef between two high school students, who had been suspended for fighting. “They had fought last week, a fist fight, last Thursday,” Boyce said. “This afternoon  …    the fight resumed. ” The two students, both 16, had just returned from their suspension on Wednesday when they met up outside to once again settle their dispute with fists, Boyce said. “One    began to win the fight, others then jumped in,” Boyce told reporters.  At some point, one of the teens involved pulled a knife and plunged it into the four victims before fleeing north on 8th Avenue.  The    was still being sought by police as of 2:30 p. m. Wednesday, officials said. Another worker at a nearby building, who also didn’t want to be named, described how two of the teens that the boy allegedly stabbed stumbled inside and begged him for help moments later. “There was two, one got it in the gut and one in the arm,” he said, recalling how the teen with the stomach wound wouldn’t stop bleeding. “He was just moaning in pain,” the man said. “I brought him some Bounty to try to keep [the bleeding under control]. It was gushing out. ” Several residents and workers in the neighborhood claimed the school that the students go to is basically a battleground.  “These kids are always fighting,” explained the first building worker. “Some of them are the worst of the worst. There are fights all the time. ” But most agreed that what transpired on Wednesday was out of the ordinary. “Today was nothing I’ve seen before,” said the second worker. “Chaos, that’s what it was.

{"article": " (CNN) It’s been a rough week for America, but it’s been a good week for masculinity. No, not because we had to endure another display of Donald Trump’s bellicose machismo, but because we witnessed two of the most powerful men in the world allow themselves to shed tears in public. Speaking of his love and appreciation for first lady Michelle Obama, President Obama was moved to tears.  And, surprised by the president’s decision to award him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Vice President Joe Biden cried, too. Might it be that we are finally, blessedly, moving beyond a world in which ”big boys don’t cry”? To be sure, there are resisters and naysayers. To take one example, media personality Laura Ingraham insisted that Obama’s crying was an act. After all, she said, ”I’ve never seen a man grab a tissue and dab, I’ve just never seen that . ..  A man will be like ’whatever’ or, like, fake through it or something.” In other words, even though he might be moved to cry, a real man would never show it. Eight years ago, Ingraham mocked NFL star Brett Favre for being a ”big hulky man” who ”broke down blubbering” at this retirement press conference.” ”Enough with the waterworks,” she demanded.  Can a real man not cry? And if he does, must he hide it? I say: Let the tears flow. What makes someone a ”real man”? Who do we want our sons to be? And who do we want fathers and husbands to be? Is the only ”real man” an alpha male, one who denies his own vulnerability    sometimes denying it so forcefully that he mocks or denigrates (or maybe just sneers at) those he sees as less than perfect, as too vulnerable, as insufficiently tough and guarded? Might it be that in this day and age a major part of what it ought to mean to be a man is an ability to admit that we are vulnerable, to be as tender as we are tough, to live with our hearts open and to refuse to be ashamed about it?  I am grateful to live at a time when a man    the most powerful man in the world, no less    can model what it means to let life affect him to the point where tears come. Would you want to be married to a man who has never been moved to tears by his love and appreciation of another human being? But I am not kidding myself. We have a long way to go in transforming masculinity. There are still far too many men    and, if we take Ingraham’s comments as evidence, women    who insist that real men don’t cry, that a man with a tissue is really just a ”sissy.” (That kind of regressive masculinity, it seems, will now enter the Oval Office.)  Make no mistake: That kind of thinking and talking has real consequences for men and boys. My father died suddenly when I was 12 years old, and I remember    it is etched into my mind and my body    being firmly instructed by a   relative, ”You can’t cry. You have to hold it together.” I recall being told by countless visitors that ”I had to be strong for my mother.” And so I walked around for years pretending to be OK, tough, strong, even though I had just lost everything. That kind of repression takes a toll on a man’s emotional and physical health. Can a man not be strong and cry    without shame? Perhaps we can model the courage it takes to cry when our heart hurts and the world seems to have fallen apart. Perhaps we can model the presence and openheartedness that make it possible to cry because the love another person has for us nourishes and sustains us.  I hope my sons will one day find a love so deep that it moves them to tears, and I hope that they remain unaffected by those who would deprive them of the full range of human emotion. When all is said and done, those who mock men who cry do little but betray their own emotional impoverishment.", "bias": {"center": 2.533667218087241e-07, "left": 0.9999986599752875, "right": 1.0866579906468642e-06}},

Please follow the steps below, On many subjects, Donald Trump has given no indication of what he’d do if elected, but he has fleshed out at least two specific elements of his domestic agenda: The press has yet to clarify what this would mean in practice. To make good on these pledges to stop and frisk millions of black people and to round up and deport millions of Hispanics who are in the U. S. without permission, Trump would have to transform America into something so like a police state that it should scare even those who abhor crime and favor many deportations. Frisking Innocent Black Bodies, In New York City, where Michael Bloomberg presided over most Stop and Frisk policing, the approach involved 4. 4 million stops —  that is to say, armed agents of the state forced New Yorkers to stop on the street 4. 4 million times between 2002 and 2015. And 88 percent of those stops resulted in no further action! Put another way, millions who did nothing wrong were needlessly stopped and harassed by police. It could not be more plain that huge numbers of them, the vast majority of whom were black and brown, gave no probable cause to justify a search. As the New York Times reported in August 2013, Stop and Frisk did not just harass masses of innocents, it violated their constitutional rights: Federal Judge Shira Scheindlin “concluded that the stops, which soared in number over the last decade as crime continued to decline, demonstrated a widespread disregard for the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures by the government, as well as the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause. ” Trump proposes to impose Stop and Frisk upon communities nationwide —  he evidently has as little regard for the Tenth Amendment as he does for the Fourth and Fourteenth. This would be a   nightmare of epic proportions.   Rounding Up and Deport Millions, Unlike deporting unauthorized immigrants who have served time for crimes rather than releasing them back into American communities, or greater enforcement against businesses that hire undocumented labor, the approach of rounding up and deporting many millions more people would require a massive force of armed agents roaming American communities, and would inevitably affect a large number of Hispanics who are legal citizens. Many legal residents will suffer harassment, as happened in Maricopa County, Arizona, under Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a perpetrator of racial profiling and an ally of Trump. Tens of thousands of new state agents would be required to carry out such roundups. What percentage of Trump’s newly hired roundup force would be hostile to Hispanics? Would they be armed? How would they be trained? Would they be about as competent at their jobs as TSA agents? Would they knock on doors of Hispanic family homes? Burst into small businesses of people who “look illegal”? How many Americans would be forced to “show their papers” like bygone East Germans? Would the    start demanding birth certificates? This, too, would be a civil liberties nightmare.   Violations, Donald Trump has a lot of proposals that are constitutionally and logistically suspect. It’s possible that he would never succeed in implementing some of them. But if he does what he says, Trump’s domestic policy would be the worst Republicans have offered blacks and Hispanics since Nixon or even Eisenhower. Millions of innocent,   blacks and Hispanics would have their rights violated. Review what Trump is offering by his own account:    for black people, and aggressive roundups of millions of Hispanics. And we haven’t even talked about the many reasons that   Muslims have to fear a Trump presidency. In past elections, Republicans have complained with some justice that Democrats cry wolf about racism. Now the GOP has gone and nominated the wolf.", "bias": {"center": 0.03744331516795238, "left": 0.9625566776330419, "right": 7.199005773730646e-09}},

This week, the photo was widely shared online again and became a trending item across social media and websites including Reddit.  “We are finding this very funny. I personally don’t see the resemblance to Tom Hanks but we’ve noticed that people have been mentioning it for years,” she told the Guardian. She said that Murray was friendly and chatted to everyone at the golf course but that their encounter was brief. “We are big Ghostbusters fans and have grown up with his movies. Although I’m also a huge fan of Tom Hanks, so that would have been awesome as well. ” Two years later,   met Murray again when he was golfing with Huey Lewis, and she got him to sign the photo. “He got a laugh from it,” she said.

{"article": "The health and science editor at the New York Times told a reader in the newspaper’s “mailbag” feature that she decided not to use the term “female genital mutilation” because it is a “culturally loaded” term that widens the “gulf” between the West and the countries where the abuse is practiced. [“I never minced words in describing exactly what form of cutting was involved, and there are many gradations of severity, and the terrible damage it did, and stayed away from the euphemistic circumcision, but chose to use the less culturally loaded term, genital cutting,” Dugger wrote in response to a reader’s question about the semantics.  Dugger said she made the decision following a trip to Africa in the 1990s. “There’s a gulf between the Western (and some African) advocates who campaign against the practice and the people who follow the rite, and I felt the language used widened that chasm,” Dugger said. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) said that some 200 million girls “alive today” are believed to have suffered the abuse, according to the FAQ portion of its website. “The term ‘female genital mutilation’ is used by a wide range of women’s health and human rights organizations,” the UN website states. “It establishes a clear distinction from male circumcision. Use of the word “mutilation” also emphasizes the gravity of the act and reinforces that the practice is a violation of women’s and girls’ basic human rights. “This expression gained support in the late 1970s, and since 1994, it has been used in several United Nations conference documents and has served as a policy and advocacy tool. ” The website text notes that “female genital cutting” was introduced in the late 1990s because of “concern that communities could find the term ‘mutilation,’ demeaning, or that it could imply that parents or practitioners perform this procedure maliciously. ” In recent days three arrests were made in Detroit where two physicians and one physician’s wife are charged with performing the abuse on minor girls.

{"article": "The globalists in world politics and international finance are celebrating a somber occasion in Davos, media reports indicate, as their influence on the global stage is waning rapidly in the wake of the U. K. referendum to leave the European Union and the U. S. election of Donald Trump to the presidency. [“The global economy is in better shape than it’s been in years. Stock markets are booming, oil prices are on the rise again and the risks of a rapid economic slowdown in China, a major source of concern a year ago, have eased,” Reuters’ Noah Barkin writes from Davos, Switzerland, at the annual summit of the world’s elite. “And yet, as political leaders, CEOs and top bankers make their annual trek up the Swiss Alps to the World Economic Forum in Davos, the mood is anything but celebratory. Beneath the veneer of optimism over the economic outlook lurks acute anxiety about an increasingly toxic political climate and a deep sense of uncertainty surrounding the U. S. presidency of Donald Trump, who will be inaugurated on the final day of the forum. ”  The Sydney Morning Herald’s Clancy Yeates has a piece detailing how this year’s World Economic Forum at Davos —  at which Chinese president Xi Jinping will speak, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel will not —  there is a focus on the “backlash” voters worldwide have delivered against globalization. “Chief executive pay has become a powerful symbol of the widening gap between the winners and losers created by globalisation, and boards must put more focus on justifying the bonuses they pay executives amid a backlash against   policies,” Yeates writes. “That is the view of the chairman of the Australian Institute of Company Directors, Elizabeth Proust, one of the Australian business leaders attending the powerful summit in Switzerland this week. The annual meeting of the global economic and political elite, in a town in the Swiss Alps, takes place against a backdrop of growing inequality in many countries, seen as a key driver for   political shocks including Brexit and Donald Trump’s win. ” The globalists at Davos still don’t seem to fully understand what is happening, as the World Economic Forum’s website published a column from Robert Muggah of the Igarape Institute with a headline stating boldly: “Populism is poison. ” He and   Misha Glenny, a writer and broadcaster, advocate for “plural cities” to defeat populism. Populism is poison. Plural cities are the antidote, says Robert Muggah https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   World Economic Forum (@wef) January 15, 2017,  “If cities are to defeat populism, they need to know what it is,” Muggah and Glenny write. “According to Princeton’s   Muller, at the core of populism is a profound rejection of pluralism. It is animated by two basic ideas  —   an opposition to diversity and a rejection of the   establishment. Populists contend that outsiders threaten the national way of life and that ‘the people’ need to exclude outsiders. The antithesis of the people is, oddly, migrants. ” Populists aren’t likely to slow their winning streak any time soon. Globalization is on the decline everywhere in the world, from Guatemala —  which elected a television comedian, Jimmy Morales, as its president back in late 2015 —  to Italy, whose recent referendum led to the resignation of prime minister Matteo Renzi. Obviously, America just elected Donald Trump and the British voted to leave the European Union. French and German presidential elections in 2017 threaten to see the potential rise of   Marine Le Pen and the possible demise of   Angela Merkel all in one fell swoop.  It’s unclear if Merkel will go down, or if Le Pen will win in France. But that we’re even at this point where it’s possible is remarkable in and of itself. Le Pen spent the past few days in New York City, making a surprise appearance at Trump Tower hoping for a meeting which she didn’t get with the  . Merkel, meanwhile, is clearly scared enough of a potential electoral loss in 2017 that she’s skipping her regular appearance in Davos at the World Economic Forum so as to avoid providing populist opponents of her globalism with any ammunition heading into this year. It comes on the heels of her pledge to ban burkhas in her speech announcing she intends to stand for   a complete reversal from a leading open borders advocate who’s perhaps singlehandedly overseen the importation of millions of Muslims into mainland Europe including Germany. The New York Times’ Michael J. de la Merced and Russell Goldman detail how the World Economic Forum has, for decades, been the exclusive annual   for the world’s political, financial and cultural elites —  a place where they gather together, and celebrate themselves. “The annual meeting runs on a tiered system of colored badges denoting just how important one is, or is not,” Merced and Goldman write. “White badges are for attendees able to attend any official event and make full use of the forum’s facilities. Orange badges are reserved for the 500 journalists who cover the forum, but are not allowed at some parties. Other badges, like purple ones, denote technical or support staff and limit their holders to a few areas. If that system were not complicated enough, local hotels like the Belvedere and the InterContinental often sell their own badges to the bankers and consultants who descend upon Davos  —   but not the forum itself  —   to strike deals and chat up clients. These souls camp out at the hotels, renting rooms for business meetings by day and soiree hopping at night. ” While most of the official events are things like lectures, speeches, panels and discussions, the Times writers highlight some of the “more esoteric attractions” like “a simulation of a refugee’s experience, where Davos attendees crawl on their hands and knees and pretend to flee from advancing armies. ” There are also lots of parties and schmoozing behind the scenes, where the elites bond together. “There are several official cocktail receptions, but the action really lies in a galaxy of events hosted by corporations. Some are small, intimate dinners that feature the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio and Bono,” Merced and Goldman write. “Others are dazzling affairs: JPMorgan Chase, for example, has previously taken over the Kirchner Museum Davos for drinks with its chief executive, Jamie Dimon, and Tony Blair, the former British prime minister. Google’s annual party at the InterContinental Hotel has become the hottest ticket in town. The investor Anthony Scaramucci, now an adviser to Donald J. Trump, for years has hosted a reception at the famed Hotel Europe featuring a sometimes   list of   Champagne and Bordeaux red wine. A more recent    is hosted by Salesforce. com, a business software maker, whose chief, Marc Benioff, is one of the forum’s most ardent boosters. Last year’s Salesforce party included Mr. Benioff flying in scores of fresh flower leis and a band from Hawaii, as Eric Schmidt of Google and other tech notables danced in a corner. Several years ago, Sean Parker of Napster and Facebook fame, hosted an    gathering that featured stuffed animal heads shooting laser beams out of their eyes. And the Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska has thrown opulent gatherings at a nearby villa where the Champagne flowed freely For a nightcap, the Davos crowd traditionally retires to the Tonic Bar at Hotel Europe, sipping cocktails while the forum fixture Barry Colson leads the crowd in Billy Joel singalongs. ” At last year’s Davos, the elites were certain the people of the world would never vote for things like Brexit or Trump or the Italian referendum. In other words, all was well. “Last year, the consensus here was that Trump had no chance of being elected. His victory, less than half a year after Britain voted to leave the European Union, was a slap at the principles that elites in Davos have long held dear, from globalization and free trade to multilateralism,” Barkin wrote in Reuters. This year, though, it’s a much gloomier affair in Davos. These world elites have found out, thanks to voters worldwide, they’re no longer the center of the universe. Financial elites are losing control on the world markets while political elites are losing control of international governments and cultural elites are seeing their star power fade. “Trump is the poster child for a new strain of populism that is spreading across the developed world and threatening the   liberal democratic order,” Barkin adds. “With elections looming in the Netherlands, France, Germany, and possibly Italy, this year, the nervousness among Davos attendees is palpable. ” And now, the gloomy affair in the Swiss Alps is getting even more depressing. According to Bloomberg’s Matthew Campbell and Simon Kennedy, those at Davos are even beginning to wonder if they’re “part of the problem. ” “Did the global elite’s devotion to borderless capitalism sow the seeds of a populist backlash?” reads the subhead of a recent Bloomberg piece from Campbell and Kennedy. The piece quotes Harvard professor and former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Kenneth Rogoff as admitting that Davos is never correct. “A joke I’ve told 1, 000 people in the months since leaving Davos is that the conventional wisdom of Davos is always wrong,” Rogoff said. “No matter how improbable, the event most likely to happen is the opposite of whatever the Davos consensus is. ” The elites at Davos are worried as the working class folks worldwide have stormed their castles and disrupted their lovely lives, the Bloomberg writers say, and they don’t find it very funny. “The repeated failure of business and political elites to predict what’s coming —  last year, that included the U. K.’s vote to leave the European Union —  doesn’t strike those returning this month to the Swiss Alps as very funny,” Campbell and Kennedy wrote. “After a year in which political upsets roiled financial markets and killed off the careers of     politicians, the concern for delegates attending this year’s meeting isn’t that their forecasts are often wrong, but that their worldview is. ” Populists shouldn’t take this as proof the war is over: The globalists will always try to fight back. There’s even rumblings that Party of Davos regular former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a disgraced   leader who lost his own primary election back in 2014 to now Rep. Dave Brat ( ) may try for a political comeback down the road. But if past is prologue, it’s unlikely these world elites will regain power and authority over the people who took their power away in the first place.", "bias": {"center": 0.002699404207204955, "left": 0.993780708997354, "right": 0.0035198867954411286}},
{"article": "The National Security Agency’s data harvesting program, PRISM, has been the subject of much speculation and controversy since its existence was revealed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2013. [PRISM is widely regarded as “the NSA spying on everyone’s Internet activity” by the public, which is left to guess at the true extent of the program from a few scraps of hard data, since so much of it remains classified.  Recent stories have suggested the scope of NSA surveillance was considerably more narrow than critics feared, but now a ruling from a federal judge suggests that surveillance remains more broad than privacy activists might have hoped.  In essence, the case is about a man arrested on terrorism charges who got caught because the NSA intercepted emails he sent to someone else they had under surveillance. Vocativ describes the defendant as Agron Hasbajrami, an Albanian citizen living in Brooklyn, who was arrested in 2011 and pled guilty to “trying to travel to Pakistan to join a militant jihadi group, as well as to wiring it money. ” After he was arrested, Hasbajrami was told his emails to another individual were swept up by the PRISM program.  He filed a motion to have the evidence against him dismissed, because the warrantless surveillance program violated his reasonable expectation of privacy.  If his motion had succeeded, the New York Law Journal cites his attorneys saying his guilty plea would have been vacated. In a ruling handed down on February 18 but not made public until this week, Federal District Court Judge John Gleeson ruled against Hasbajrami, saying the collection of email evidence against him was “reasonable in light of the Fourth Amendment’s protections. ” The ruling noted that under the relevant law, the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, prosecutors are not required to specify the exact people and places they plan to keep under surveillance when they apply to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. To bring this in line with the earlier NSA Inspector General report which portrayed the electronic surveillance programs more limited than critics believed, the NSA might not be “reading everyone’s email,” but they are allowed to consider all intercepts related to investigations authorized by a FISA court.  Hasbajrami barged into such an investigation with his email, and became fair game. The New York Law Journal notes Judge Gleeson was aware there are few things “more unsettling than the idea of a government spying on its own citizens”and acknowledged there has been “legitimate criticism of electronic surveillance practices,” the action against Hasbajrami was reasonable and consistent with the law. Vocativ notes that Glesson’s ruling provided some of the clearest testimony to date about how the PRISM program works: In PRISM collection, the government identifies the user accounts it wants to monitor and sends a ‘selector’ —  a specific communications facility, such as a target’s email address or telephone number —  to the relevant communications service provider. A government directive then compels the communications service provider to give it communications sent to or from that selector. This type of surveillance, which intercepts ‘ ’ communications, can result in the interception of communications with U. S. persons if the target happens to communicate with such a person. ” This is also consistent with the NSA Inspector General’s report, which said it was   Internet providers sifting through data to locate responsive material, rather than government agents. The Next Web notes this judicial ruling is the first official confirmation that PRISM, which allows the government to collect data directly from the servers of Internet providers, exists as a program distinct from “upstream data collection,” which fishes through data as it flows across the Internet. “The distinction between programs is important as, to date, the NSA has never verified the existence of its PRISM program. Now, it’s undeniable and could lead to more transparent conversations about government surveillance programs, but that’s probably wishful thinking,” The Next Web ventures.", "bias": {"center": 0.5090561845859756, "left": 0.49087681235116953, "right": 6.700306285491353e-05}},
{"article": "Barack Obama has ordered US intelligence to review evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election after coming under sustained pressure from congressional Democrats. The review will be one of Obama’s final instructions to the intelligence agencies, which will soon report to Donald Trump, whom congressional Democrats consider the beneficiary of a hack targeting the Democratic National Committee. Lisa Monaco, the White House counterterrorism director, announced what she called a “full review” at a breakfast briefing sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor on Friday. At the White House press briefing later on Friday, Eric Schultz, the deputy White House press secretary, denied the review was “an effort to challenge the outcome of the election”.  “We have acknowledged who won the election,” he said. “It wasn’t the candidate the president campaigned for. He has gone out of his way to ensure a smooth transition of power. ” The review will span the last three presidential election cycles, Schultz told reporters. “These agencies will have to take a look at what we saw in 2008, 2012 and 2016. This is going to be a deep dive. This is a review that will be broad and deep at the same time. They’re going to look at where the activity leads them to look at. ” There were intrusions into both the Obama and John McCain campaigns in 2008, publicly attributed to the Chinese, he continued, and although there were no notable incidents in 2012, “knowing what we know now” that election will also be scrutinised.  In 2016, he said, the government did not detect any increased cyber activity on election day itself but the FBI made public specific acts in the summer and fall, tied to the highest levels of the Russian government. “This is going to put that activity in a greater context . .. dating all the way back to 2008. ” Asked if the review would investigate Russia’s motives, Schultz replied: “Malicious cyber activity, specifically malicious cyber activity tied to our elections, has no place in the international community. Unfortunately this activity is not new to Moscow. We’ve seen them do this for years . .. The president has made it clear to President Putin that this is unacceptable. ” Obama expected the review to be completed before he leaves office, Schultz said. “This is a huge priority . .. I think the president wanted this done under his watch because he takes it very seriously. This is something the president has been watching closely for eight years now. ” Schultz also told the briefing: “We’re going to make public as much as we can. As you can imagine, something like this might include sensitive and even classified information. When that report is submitted we’re going to take a look. We want to brief Congress and the relevant stakeholders, possible state directors. ” “This is good news. Declassifying and releasing information about the Russian government and the US election, and doing so quickly, must be a priority,” said Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee. In October, the director of national intelligence and the secretary of homeland security publicly accused the “ ” levels of the Russian government of directing those digital breaches. Trump, who has treated Russian president Vladimir Putin with a warmth unequalled by most US politicians, has repeatedly dismissed the accusation as politically motivated. US intelligence laid the blame for the DNC hack at Russia’s feet but has not provided evidence supporting the accusation, although several private cybersecurity firms reaching the same conclusion have. Earlier this month, all the Democratic members of the Senate intelligence committee publicly intimated the administration knows significantly more about Russian culpability than the October statement revealed, and implored Obama for a public disclosure he has thus far resisted.  Yet the White House was more sympathetic to a request earlier this week from several senior Democrats in the House of Representatives, who wrote to Obama requesting a classified briefing on the role the Russians played in the election.  While Democrats, stung by a rout in an election many expected to win, have spearheaded the calls for disclosure of Russian interference, they also have some Republican support. Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina hawk who savaged Trump on the campaign trail, told CNN this week he will use his Senate perch to pursue an investigation of Russian involvement in the DNC hack.  According to Monaco, the review will be classified and delivered to lawmakers before Obama leaves office on 20 January.  Democrats immediately pounced on the announced review and pressed the White House to declassify it before Trump takes office. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said Russia had “succeeded” in “sow[ing] discord” in the election, and urged as much public disclosure as is possible. “More than that, the administration must begin to take steps to respond forcefully to this blatant cyber meddling, and work with our allies in Europe who have been targets of similar attacks to impose costs on the Kremlin if we do not, we can expect to see a lot more of this in the near future,” Schiff said Friday. A spokesman for the director of national intelligence declined to comment. ", "bias": {"center": 6.165666357122391e-06, "left": 0.9999938342981082, "right": 3.553467439254085e-11}},
{"article": "On Thursday’s Breitbart News Daily, SiriusXM host Alex Marlow asked Breitbart News Senior Editor at Large Peter Schweizer about allegations that Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign chairman, John Podesta, may have violated federal law through his dealings with the Russians. [Schweizer said Podesta has “a very interesting relationship with Russia, going back to when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. ”  “When she was secretary of state, he was an adviser. He sat on her foreign policy advisory board. We know from the Podesta emails that he was talking to her all the time on everything from speeches to personnel decisions to policy positions,” Schweizer elaborated. “In 2011, he joins the executive board of this small energy company in Massachusetts called Joule Energy,” Schweizer recalled. “And Joule Energy, about two months after he joins the executive board, gets a large infusion of cash. They get one billion rubles, which is about $35 to $45 million, invested from Russia. It comes from a very unusual entity, this entity called RUSNANO. ”  “RUSNANO is this   investment fund, called ‘Putin’s Child’ by the Russian Science Ministry, so it shows you how connected this fund is,” he explained. “They actually buy an equity stake in this John   company, which they can do. You can raise the question of why they’re doing it while he’s advising Hillary Clinton, but they can legally do that. ” “The problem for Podesta becomes when he joins the Obama White House as counselor to the president in 2013,” he continued. “In order to do that, he’s got to file those large, cumbersome, but I think essential financial disclosure forms where you list what boards are you on, that you are connected to or have been connected to in the last year, what entities. You’re also required to disclose your stock holdings. ”  “In the case of Podesta, there are two omissions. One of them is the way the Joule was structured, it has three corporate boards. It has one based in Massachusetts, one based in the Netherlands, and then it has a holding company. John Podesta, according to corporate records, was on all three of those boards. He only listed two of them on his financial disclosure. He omitted probably the most important one, which was the holding company,” said Schweizer. “Now, you could say okay, maybe it was just an omission. He listed two of the three that’s not bad,” he granted. “The problem is that he failed to disclose what he did with the 75, 000 shares of stock that he had in the company that were given to him as a board member. He gave them to his daughter through an LLC. ” “There’s a question of whether she actually owned them  —   and by that I mean the Podesta emails show that he had a   email conversation with Joule Energy executives and people connected with them, even though he ostensibly didn’t own stock anymore. But he failed to disclose that transaction. He failed to disclose the 75, 000 shares he owned that he gave to his daughter. That is a direct, clear violation of what you are supposed to disclose on these federal forms,” Schweizer said. Marlow noted there have been “zero pieces of hard evidence connecting the Trump campaign to the Russian government,” while “there is so much evidence, much of it uncovered by you, connecting the Clintons with the Russian government. ”  “And yet, the media is obsessed with one and not the other,” he said. Schweizer found the disparity of coverage interesting as well. “I’m a big believer that you need to investigate and look into things, particularly if you’re talking about foreign governments or foreign entities trying to influence our politicians,” he declared. “What we know right now about the Russia story as it relates to Trump is the relationship, as it were, amounts to meetings that some Trump officials had with people from Russia. Those Trump officials never really made it into the Trump administration  —   with the exception of Michael Flynn, who left pretty quickly,” he pointed out.  “The thesis that everybody is operating on is the Russians helped Trump win and Trump is going to do all these favors for Russia. The problem is, when you look at the personnel decisions, who’s running Russia policy in the United States  —   whether that’s General Mattis at the Pentagon, whether that is McMaster, the national security adviser, whether that’s the CIA director, whether that’s the director of Russia policy on the National Security Council, who’s a very solid scholar from the Brookings Institution  —   none of these are remotely ” he said.  “All you have is sort of this concern that the Russians were hacking during the election, which I think is a legitimate concern and a theory that hasn’t been proved, that there was a connection between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. There’s just been no evidence of that,” he noted.  “My point is both should be looked into, but you actually have very substantial things that went on when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, that, number one, included the transfer of money to the Clintons and to John Podesta and number two, very serious favors done by the Hillary Clinton State Department to the Russians, including technology transfer, et cetera,” he said.  “The kind of scenario that people envision happened with Trump happened in the Clinton State Department. And yet, there seems to be a lack of interest in pursuing and investigating precisely what those relationships were and how everything was carried out,” Schweizer observed.

{"article": " DC Protestor ”Rape Melania” Less than a week after the 2016 presidential election, a Trump supporter named Alan Beck tweeted two photographs of an   protest in Washington, DC, in which a hooded figure held aloft a sign reading “Rape Melania. ” The images went viral, and the sign  —   as well as Twitter  —   drew swift condemnation from news outlets both right and left. Some Trump supporters took the sign as confirmation that the passionate national opposition to the   was ultimately anarchic and violent. (Many of these supporters had drawn a similar conclusion about the Black Lives Matter movement.) “The current surge in the left’s propensity toward violence and mayhem should surprise no one,” wrote one InfoWars commenter. And to some Clinton supporters, the sign was a gutting refutation of Michelle Obama’s “when they go low, we go high” speech and a reminder that Trump rallies didn’t hold a monopoly on menace. But, BuzzFeed News has learned, the “Rape Melania” sign was not the work of an   protester at all. Instead, according to sources, it was the brainchild of a group of Trump supporters led by Jack Posobiec, one of the organizers of the controversial DeploraBall inauguration party and a prominent figure in the   internet. Furthermore, as shown by a series of Posobiec’s text messages obtained by BuzzFeed News and confirmed by a source who collaborated with Posobiec, the sign was the culmination of a disinformation campaign by Posobiec and others intended to paint the   rallies as violent and out of control. In a phone call with BuzzFeed News, Posobiec denied that the texts were sent by him and said that it was likely they had been photoshopped. He also denied having any involvement in the campaign. BuzzFeed News reviewed the texts on a source’s iPhone in Signal, the secure texting app, and the Signal messages allegedly from Posobiec came from the same phone number on which BuzzFeed News talked to Posobiec. At 9:59 p. m. on Nov. 10, Posobiec posted a video to Twitter of an   protester yelling “Assassinate that nigga. ” In a 10:30 p. m. text message that same night, Posobiec claimed that he’d started an “assassinate Trump” chant to goad protesters into copying him, with the intention of filming them: Though the video didn’t go viral, it was picked up by Russia Today and some conservative blogs. In the same text message conversation, Posobiec and his collaborator brainstormed other incendiary things to chant, including “Rape Melania. ” Two days later, in another text obtained by BuzzFeed News, Posobiec discussed with another collaborator his plan to “discredit” an   protest by infiltrating it “with the bad signs. ” According to a source, it is Posobiec himself holding the “Rape Melania” sign in the photographs published by Beck  —   a charge Posobiec also denies. After posting the photographs, Beck uploaded a   YouTube video of himself and Posobiec sitting in a car near the protest, titled “  Protester Created’R4PE MELANIA!’ Sign and The Rest of the Protesters Do Nothing. ” The following day, a collaborator texted Posobiec a screenshot of Twitter’s trending topics, of which “Rape Melania” was number three. Posobiec responded, “Woah!” Today, the former DeploraBall organizer Tim Gionet  —   who goes by Baked Alaska on Twitter  —   accused Posobiec of making the sign. . @MAGA3X I have a question. Your organizer @JackPosobiec was the one who made the ”Rape Melania” sign, do you support this behavior? Posobiec, who is the special projects director of a grassroots organization called Citizens for Trump, has been at the center of several flareups of the new right media in recent weeks. In November, Posobiec was thrown out of Comet Ping Pong, the Washington, DC, pizza parlor made infamous by #pizzagate, for filming a children’s birthday party. And in December, Posobiec started the viral #DumpStarWars hashtag after claiming that Rogue One contained   scenes.

Two of Uber’s autonomous cars are already wheeling around San Francisco, but they are being driven manually while the company is ”taking steps to complete our application to apply for a DMV testing permit,” an Uber spokeswoman said.

There’s a new   text message in town that people will keep sending to their   buddies. However, it can all be easily fixed.    and   the bug relies on sending a string of images and characters to a target: a white flag emoji, a zero, and the rainbow emoji.

However, the actual sending of the message isn’t completely   as the same string can also freeze the sender’s phone.

Once the message hits the targeted iPhone, the device stops working for a few minutes regardless of whether the recipient reads it or not. You won’t be able to do anything once the freeze is in effect.

What I’m assuming is happening is that the phone tries to combine the waving white flag and the zero into an emoji, but this obviously can’t be done.

{"article": "For Daniel Patrick Moynihan, it was the racism charges that broke the camel’s back. His famous 1965 report on the pathologies of black culture landed him in a hornet’s nest. “I was not a bigot,” he wrote later, “but the good guys were calling me a racist, while here was this fellow Buckley saying these thoughtful things. Glazer and I began to notice that we were getting treated in National Review with a much higher level of intellectual honesty. ” Moynihan was just one of many   who was startled to find a rare bastion of sanity in National Review. That trickle of refugees from liberalism would prove critical to getting William Buckley’s fledgling conservative movement off the ground. Having once regarded themselves as liberals, many neoconservatives had managed to attain influential mainstream positions that traditionalists of Russell Kirk’s persuasion would likely have found difficult. They were invaluable for raising the movement’s profile. At the same time, their experience and background made them savvy to policy. They would lay the groundwork for conservative policy developments over the next several decades. The time is ripe for recruiting a new crop of  . Who’s ready to get mugged by reality? As liberalism declines, conservatives need to make sure that our doors are open to refugees from the other team. It might also be helpful to extend a few feelers to people who show some sympathy to conservative ideas. Where   ideology is the only game in town, one or two persuasive arguments might sometimes be enough to instill deep doubts. The Left may be especially vulnerable to this kind of offensive precisely because they are so dominant in the academy, the mainstream media, and many of the professions. First and foremost, our nation is drowning in debt even as our entitlement and pension commitments are becoming dramatically more onerous. The 2016 election has driven this issue out of sight and mind, as both major candidates lure voters with promises of still more goodies. Regrettably, fiscal problems on this scale never consent to stay in hiding for very long. Owing to irresponsible and dishonest promises made by mostly retired politicians, many aging Americans have dramatically   for their retirement years. They’re betting that taxpayers will somehow find a way to bail them out. This will be possible only up to a point. What we’re facing, over the medium term, is a significant   of the social contract. As longtime advocates of localism and fiscal discipline, conservatives are in a much better position to generate helpful insights and reasonable compromises. Those could serve as recruiting calls for liberals who are broadly sympathetic to the stated aims of union negotiations and Great Society reforms but who ultimately are honest enough to acknowledge the mess that those initiatives have created. As in Moynihan’s time, race is becoming a defining cultural fault line, and once again, the Left has committed itself to unstable movements with questionable agendas. Black Lives Matter has at least some sympathetic concerns, and many conservatives are already at work on them, looking for ways to improve police transparency and prudently reduce our reliance on incarceration. Those goals are not advanced when protesters seize on any excuse to start torching police cars and smashing shop windows. Given that violent uprisings like the one in Charlotte almost certainly help Donald Trump more than they do Hillary Clinton, it seems clear that the Left, in whose   it would be to control the activities of Black Lives Matter, is unable to do so. Just as Moynihan was repelled by the Left’s obtuseness in denying glaring pathologies in black culture, so today’s progressives may eventually be attracted to a political movement that offers more than racial pieties. What we offer must be more than just a redux of the    narrative. In the 1970s, conservatives could plausibly argue that laxness in the justice system was facilitating cultural collapse. That’s a much harder sell today, and it’s certainly not a promising starting point for recruiting disaffected liberals. The good news is that we can offer compelling solutions to crime and racial tensions we do not have to resurrect anachronistic memes. We should point out repeatedly that crime and social collapse are especially egregious in longtime Democratic strongholds such as Chicago. Blue states including California have reformed their penal codes in haphazard ways that precipitated crime spikes. Meanwhile, red states including Texas and Georgia have had much greater success on the reform front, launching new initiatives that address   without sacrificing public safety. In short, conservatives are well equipped to reform our justice system reasonably, to everyone’s benefit. The Left is not, because Democrats are hopelessly beholden to surging social movements and hysterical interest groups. This argument might prove compelling for many disaffected liberals as they arrive at the (classically neoconservative) conclusion that reality is more complicated than they once believed. This leads us to a further consideration, which might prove compelling particularly for younger progressives who have been inundated with leftist memes from childhood onwards. For many Millennials, conservatism is like a foreign language. They lack even the foundational concepts that would enable them to grapple with the arguments. What is “free trade”? Are there really people who still believe that men and women are fundamentally different? What do we mean by “limited government”? As young liberals sour on what is to them the old world of the political and cultural Left, conservative ideas might have a real allure. For younger generations, tradition often has the benefit of feeling simultaneously   and novel. We might generate considerable momentum by daring young radicals to embrace conservatism, a truly countercultural move that promises to drive their teachers (and parents?) crazy. This list of suggestions is by no means exhaustive. The past eight years have treated us to a veritable parade of   failures. Barack Obama’s   foreign policy has left us with a host of burgeoning geopolitical threats. The president’s signature policy initiative is rapidly failing. Corruption and graft have increased, and civil liberties are eroding, even as two Caesari candidates vie for the Oval Office. If we’re looking for arguments to prove that the Left has failed America, we are truly spoiled for choice. No argument, of course, will convince everyone. That’s not necessary.

{"article": "GOP vice presidential nominee Mike Pence called out the mainstream media on Saturday for focusing most of their time trying to parse Donald Trump’s words than investigating the scandals that have followed the Clintons throughout their political careers.  “The media is so busy parsing what Donald Trump said in the last 30 minutes that they keep ignoring what the Clintons have been doing for the last 30 years,” Pence said Saturday at Patrick Henry College in Virginia. The Indiana Governor called the mainstream press “the party in power” and said they, along with Democrats, “all keep telling each other that the usual methods are going to work” to take down Trump and “then they wake up the next morning  …     and Donald Trump is still standing fighting for the American people and fighting to make this country great and strong again. ” Pence said Trump has to battle Clinton and the media on the campaign trail as the mainstream press ignore the “cascade of controversies and questionable conduct that flows out of the Clinton years. ” Pence slammed Clinton for using a private server and deleting her emails with BleachBit. He mentioned that the FBI tried to open up a criminal investigation into the Clinton Foundation but the Obama administration blocked it. He also reminded voters that the FBI found 15, 000 more Clinton emails that were not turned over while others proved that Clinton’s State Department gave expedited access to foundation donors. He also blasted the Obama administration for deciding not to provide Clinton’s    schedule at the State Department until after the election after an Associated Press report found that half of her meetings were with foundation donors while reviewing half of her State Department schedule. “Now let me get this straight,” Pence said. “So it would be a conflict of interest to accept foreign and corporate donations to your foundation if you were president, but it wasn’t a conflict of interest to accept foreign donations while you were Secretary of State?” He said the Clinton Foundation should be shut down and the Justice Department should appoint a special prosector. Pence said Americans are “sick and tired of pay to play politics in Washington, D. C. ” and “it’s the kind of politics that will come to a crashing end” when Trump is elected. Pence added that “the days of the rigged system of the favored few will come to an end and Donald Trump’s only special interest will be you, the American people. ”", "bias": {"center": 6.94582567580646e-11, "left": 1.380062605502175e-10, "right": 0.9999999997925355}},
{"article": "When I was a kid, “Quantum Leap” was one of my favorite TV shows. Its conceit was ludicrous, but in a way that allowed for maximum entertainment: A   experiment gone awry forces the handsome Dr. Sam Beckett to “leap” among different bodies at various points in history. Each episode began with Beckett waking up in a new situation and piecing together the mystery of his surroundings. The show didn’t shy away from serious themes: In one, he wakes up in the body of a woman who has just been raped in another, he wakes up in the body of a black man in Alabama in the 1950s. “Quantum Leap” has stayed with me all these years, I think, because it offered my young, impressionable mind a framework for normal travel. Arriving in a new place  —   even if it’s in the same dimension  —   can be disjointing and chaotic, because each new destination is governed by an invisible set of rules. Traditional guidebooks have never quite done it for me. Too often they seem to be aimed at a certain type of comfortable,   traveler. And I happen to know intimately that the authors weren’t always the most informed: One of my first paid writing jobs was for a   company, where I penned florid prose about sea turtles in Costa Rica a full three years before I ever set foot in the country. The rise of the social web promised a new era of personalization for  . But like many things born online, as popularity of the new tools increased, efficiency and usefulness began to decrease. Brands and businesses quickly set to figuring out how to manipulate and game the services, and they soon succeeded. Yelp, for example, lost credibility after it was revealed that businesses solicited people to write fake reviews. Foursquare’s recommendations were initially a wealth of insider tips, but advertisers often bought their way into the recommendations, giving chains priority over local businesses. TripAdvisor has a slightly different problem: Its ambit is so broad that its recommendations have come to represent a safe median, a poll of polls. It’s great for making sure a restaurant you want to eat in won’t give you dysentery, but less so for identifying adventures or local secrets. Each of these shortcomings is different, but they amount to the same problem: These tools have come to replicate the biases and generic quality of the     travel guides they were meant to replace. And as the vis ual web matured, this problem seemed to be replicating itself yet again. Tourist boards flew popular Instagrammers to their idyllic locations and paid them to post impossibly stunning photographs to attract other world trekkers. Locations that may have once been hidden gems, like New Zealand’s South Island, became hot spots  —   a boon for the local economy but bad for reliable reviews. When people talk about how the internet has changed the way we travel, they typically lament the way our compulsion to document removes us, somehow, from the actual experience. In an article for Backchannel on Medium earlier this year called “Instagram Is Ruining Vacation,” Mary Pilon wrote about   dependency and how the “fight for the perfect Instagram” was influencing where  —   and how  —   people decided to spend their time. “At times, it felt like destinations were morphing into mere photo sets,” she writes about tourist behavior on a trip to Angkor Wat. But that same urge to share has created what is, for me, the best travel resource on the web: using   searches on   apps, especially Insta gram, to drop in, like Dr. Beckett, to different destinations. Looking at the raw feed of geotagged posts offers a graphic map in real time, which you can comb through to make your own guidebook. I like to think of it as akin to a surf cam. But instead of tuning in to see if the waves are too mushy, feeds give a feel for a place that you can use to decide if a place feels fun and seems safe  —   whatever that means to you. And this has become my compass, my way of navigating the world. Rather than obsessing over travel sites or print guides or bothering friends for recommendations, I check a new city or town’s location tag right before I get there and see which recent posts are most popular. What I see there is wildly unfiltered, refracted through multiple perspectives  —   and much more revealing than any other guide. Before I went to Senegal in March, I spent two days watching the location tags for Gorée Island, a landmark famous for its horrible history. It was there that captured Africans were imprisoned before being shipped to the Americas to be sold into slavery. The feed on the Gorée Island location tag was cluttered with tourists’ selfies. Worried that such cluelessness would ruin the experience and heighten the impact of the island’s historical trauma, I decided to see the island some other time and have dinner with a friend and her family at their home instead. This approach also affords a window into cultural insights I might not get other wise. The year before, in Morocco, a group of friends and I were unsure how best to dress when walking around a small town outside Tangier  —   we wanted to be especially respectful because we were visiting during Ramadan  —   so we browsed local Instagram posts until we had a sense of what was appropriate. In Puerto Rico, I was eager to experience the   culture, so I scanned tags on Instagram until I sighted brown and black bodies in the location tag for Piñones, a beach outpost where families swim in the sea and vendors sell cold coconuts and alcapurrias, fritters stuffed with crab and cheese. It was one of the highlights of the trip. Just about any app with geolocation will do each, in its own way, offers you direct access to locals and fellow travelers alike. While on an extended trip in Norway, and desperate for nonnative Norwegians to meet, I prowled and posted on Yik Yak in Oslo to try to figure out where young brown people hung out. In Cape Cod, I used Her  —   a dating app  —   to look into where young lesbians gathered in   Provincetown. These apps can also work in unexpected ways, specifically to avoid harm and danger: In Dakar, my friend and I received warnings via Grindr about inquiring openly about gay bars and hangouts, as homosexuality is still illegal in Senegal. A few months later, back home in New York, in an effort to safely celebrate Pride in the aftermath of the shootings in Orlando at Pulse, these   samplings were crucial for determining the temperature of gay events around the city. Lately, I’ve been thinking about these   uses through another lens. In the early 20th century, segregation and racial hostility meant that traveling while black in America was an extremely dangerous affair. In 1936, a Harlem postal worker named Victor Green published a booklet called “The Negro Motorist Green Book,” or just “The Green Book,” comprising information he and other postal workers had gathered along their routes about establishments that would welcome black travelers. The book became less relevant by the  ’60s, as the rise of the civil rights movement and the fight for equal access diminished the popularity of the Jim Crow staple. But even as laws and culture have changed, the rules are still not the same for everyone in America, or the world. The reality is that we all move through the world subject to subtly different forces and dynamics. As an adult venturing out, I’ve come to figure out that adaptability requires assembling my own version of a Green Book, made in real time, generated almost accidentally by our collective need to share.", "bias": {"center": 5.346523965564685e-06, "left": 0.9999946534759846, "right": 4.9679427635124636e-14}},
{"article": "WASHINGTON  —   As Chase Sherman was returning home with his parents and fiancée from his brother’s wedding in November, he began to hallucinate. Apparently reacting to synthetic marijuana he took days earlier, he bit his girlfriend and tried to jump out of the back seat of the car as the family drove through Georgia toward Florida. About an hour outside Atlanta, at Mile Marker 55 on Interstate 85, his fiancée pulled over the car and his mother called the police, hoping they would help calm Mr. Sherman, 32. Less than a   later, Mr. Sherman, who worked at a   parasailing business on the Gulf Coast, was dead. He was stunned numerous times with Taser guns carried by two sheriff’s deputies, while handcuffed in the back seat of a rental car. Like other recent episodes involving the police, this one was captured on video, in this case by body cameras worn by the sheriff’s deputies as they tried to subdue Mr. Sherman. The video, a copy of which was obtained in recent days by The New York Times, is similar to recordings of fatal encounters involving law enforcement officers in Chicago North Charleston, S. C. and Staten Island. Each one depicts in stark terms a response from officers that resulted in a death. In this instance, there are no racial overtones: Both Mr. Sherman and the deputy sheriffs are white. The footage from Georgia was released Friday by prosecutors in Coweta County in response to requests from the family and the news media. It shows the sheriff’s deputies struggling to subdue Mr. Sherman as he tried to get out of the car, stunning him repeatedly with their Taser guns while he was handcuffed, and reacting frantically after realizing he was dead. Mr. Sherman’s death was a homicide due to “an altercation with law enforcement with several trigger pulls of an electronic control device,” according to his death certificate, which said that he had been shoved to the floor of the car and that his torso was compressed “by the body weight of another individual. ” “How can they do this when they know someone is having a breakdown?” said L. Chris Stewart, a lawyer for the Sherman family. “Once they started shocking him, how can someone comply when they’re being electrocuted over and over again?” Kevin and Mary Ann Sherman, Chase Sherman’s parents, said they were not sure what had caused their son’s odd behavior. They said they first became concerned when he began acting erratically while they were in the Dominican Republic for the wedding. Chase told his mother that he had taken the synthetic marijuana the day before they traveled there. “He was scared when we were down there,” Ms. Sherman said. “He said he heard different bad things were happening in different countries. He would see a couple of things that weren’t there. He thought people were watching him, and he didn’t want to go anywhere without his mom and dad or brother. ” But his parents said he had seemed fine on the flight back to Atlanta, where they were to change planes and continue their trip home to Destin, Fla. Then, as they waited at the Atlanta airport, Mr. Sherman grew agitated. The family decided it would be better to drive the rest of the way, so they rented a car. Not long into the drive, Mr. Sherman began trying to jump out of the car. “I couldn’t keep him in the car  —   he didn’t know where he was and was disoriented,” Kevin Sherman said. “I couldn’t keep him in the car by myself, so we needed to call for medical assistance. ” A body camera worn by one of the deputies started recording while en route to assist the Shermans. By the time he reached their car, parked on the shoulder of the highway, another deputy was already grappling with Mr. Sherman, who was handcuffed, in the car’s back seat. On the video, Mr. Sherman seemed alternately calm and desperate to get out of the car. To try to stop him, one of the deputies took out a Taser gun and pointed it at him, telling him to stop moving. Mr. Sherman grabbed the Taser gun, and a fight for it ensued. With Mr. Sherman’s mother and his fiancée, Patti Galloway, watching from the front of the car, the deputy shot him several times with the Taser, and the second deputy punched him in the head. The deputies then told the two women to get out of the car, and Ms. Sherman pointed her finger at the two deputies, pleading with them not to stun her son. Mr. Sherman was stunned again, and then he appeared to wrestle away control of the Taser despite still being handcuffed. Moments later, an emergency medical technician who had arrived at the scene tried to help subdue Mr. Sherman. “O. K. I’m dead, I’m dead,” Mr. Sherman said as he was shoved to the floor and wedged between the front and back seats. “I quit, I quit,” he could be heard saying. The medical technician pushed down on Mr. Sherman’s body. “I got all the weight of the world on him now,” he could be heard saying before Mr. Sherman was shocked again. But suddenly realizing that Mr. Sherman was not breathing, the deputy sheriffs and the medical technician pulled him out of the car and began performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation while his parents and Ms. Galloway watched. “There was no way for him to resist,” said the lawyer, Mr. Stewart. “For four minutes and 10 seconds after he said ‘I quit,’ they still tased him and kept him on the ground. That’s torture, and they killed him. ” Mr. Sherman’s death was initially investigated by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which made the evidence it collected available to the district attorney of Coweta County, Peter J. Skandalakis. Mr. Skandalakis said Friday that his office’s investigation into Mr. Sherman’s death was continuing. “I really haven’t formed a final opinion about it,” he said, adding that his office had planned to release the video before the inquiry’s conclusion because of “public interest in the case. ” He said he hoped to meet eventually with the Sherman family. In the meantime, the deputies who responded to the family’s request for help have not been suspended, according to Mr. Stewart, and are still working.", "bias": {"center": 2.2797164814333718e-11, "left": 1.5612729960479937e-07, "right": 0.9999998438499034}},
{"article": "Louis Casanova is playing cards with a friend on the back deck of a recovery house in Philadelphia’s northern suburbs. He’s warm and open as he talks about his past few years. The guy everyone calls Louie started using drugs like Xanax and Valium during his freshman year of high school. At age 18, Casanova turned to heroin. About two years later, the rehab shuffle began. ”I relapsed and then I was just getting high. And then I went to treatment again in February of 2015,” he says. ”Then I relapsed again and went back to treatment.” He’s 23 now. He’s hurt people close to him and his criminal record, fueled by his drug addiction, is long. By Louie’s count, he has been through eight inpatient rehabs. Louis says his stays have ranged from about 18 to 45 days. ”I did 30 days, and after that I came here,” he concludes, talking about his latest visit. A month’s stay can be pretty typical among people who go to an inpatient facility. But why? ”As far as I know, there’s nothing magical about 28 days,” says Kimberly Johnson, director of the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment at SAMHSA, the federal agency that studies treatment services. Anne Fletcher, author of the book Inside Rehab, agrees. ”It certainly is not scientifically based,” she says. ”I live in Minnesota where the model was developed and a lot of treatment across the country really stemmed from that.” She says the late Daniel Anderson was one of the primary architects of the ”Minnesota model,” which became the prevailing treatment protocol for addiction specialists. At a state hospital in Minnesota in the 1950s, Anderson saw alcoholics living in locked wards, leaving only to be put to work on a farm. To find a path for them to get sober and leave the hospital, he came up with the   model. Marvin Ventrell, executive director of the National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers, has studied the model’s history. He says the   standard comes from the notion that when ”someone is suffering from addiction  —   and in the days that this began, we’re pretty much talking about alcoholism  —   it made sense to people that it took about four weeks to stabilize somebody.” And then, Ventrell says, ”It became the norm because the insurance industry was willing to pay for that period of time.” Now the model has spread to treatment for opioid addiction, even though recovering from addiction to those powerful drugs may require a different method. Ventrell admits there isn’t enough research about the most effective length for an inpatient stay for opioid addiction. ”Treatment centers have to step up and say, ’Just like cancer or heart disease, we’re going to measure our outcomes and show them to you,’ ” he says. The federal government estimates spending on treatment for all substance abuse will hit a high of $42 billion by 2020. Some people pay tens of thousands of dollars, desperately hoping inpatient treatment will work. But there’s increasing evidence that medication assisted treatment with the synthetic opioids methadone or suboxone can help those addicted by helping to relieve symptoms of withdrawal and reduce craving, especially when paired with strong outpatient counseling and other support. Fletcher says it’s important for treatment to move away from the default   model. That may be enough for some people, she says, but it ”isn’t the case for most people. It’s like any other chronic disorder, it waxes and wanes.”  After his inpatient stays, Casanova is still trying to break his addiction. While he says recovery largely depends on the person, he preferred longer stays because it gave him more time to learn from other patients in a supportive environment. But Casanova is just one person others prefer inpatient stays that are shorter than a month, followed by intensive outpatient programs. Casanova relapsed in February, before I talked to him, and recently had to serve some jail time. But he’s back in the recovery house, and hoping to soon make the leap to the next stage  —   a house with even more independence.

{"article": "People stopped, stared and posed for photos. A colourful mural on the side of Ben’s Chili Bowl restaurant, a lynchpin of African American life in Washington, included Barack and Michelle Obama, Muhammad Ali, Prince and Harriet Tubman. It included actor Taraji P Henson and rapper Wale. But one prominent local figure was missing. “Is this where Bill Cosby used to be?” asked Vivian Staine, 30, a nurse and studio owner, as she beheld the artwork for the first time. “It’s kind of shocking to see Bill Cosby is down after he’s been here so long. ” The entertainer’s fall from grace has posed difficult questions for many in the black community and for Ben’s Chili Bowl in particular. Cosby has been a regular customer since his navy days in the 1950s. He befriended its owners, Ben Ali, an immigrant from Trinidad who died in 2009, and his wife Virginia, who now runs the restaurant with their three sons. A historical information sign outside states: “Thanks in part to the patronage of entertainer Bill Cosby, Ben’s has become a national landmark. ” It was no surprise that when artist Aniekan Udofia painted a mural on the restaurant’s exterior wall in 2012, it featured Cosby along with Obama, local radio DJ Donnie Simpson and godfather of   Chuck Brown. But then came allegations that Cosby sexually assaulted dozens of women and court documents showing that he admitted intending to drug women he wanted to have sex with. Last Saturday, in Pennsylvania, a judge in the sexual assault trial of    Cosby declared a mistrial after jurors reported a hopeless deadlock after six days of deliberation. On Wednesday, in a ceremony featuring comedian Dave Chappelle and others, Udofia unveiled a new mural expanded to 16 luminaries  —   but minus Cosby. Virginia Ali, 83, explains that the restaurant ran an online poll to ask the public who should be included: Barack Obama came first, Michelle Obama was second and Cosby did not place in the top 16.  Referring to the allegations against him, she said: “That’s not the man I knew. It’s one of those ‘he said, she said’ things and there’s no point getting into it because I wasn’t there. I feel badly for everyone involved. ” Cosby’s face is still visible in two photo montages inside the restaurant, which is famous for its signature    —   a sausage with mustard, chopped onions and homemade chili on a hotdog bun. Ali said: “Everybody’s welcome to Ben’s. When you walk in the door, what you’ve done is left outside and we treat you as family, as a guest. We treat everyone with the same dignity and warmth. We don’t judge people here. ” As newlyweds in 1958, Ben and Virginia Ali used their $5, 000 savings to renovate and open the restaurant on U Street in what had been a silent film cinema. They had spotted a gap in the market.  “There were a lot of hamburger places in this town but there were no hot dog and no chili places,” Virginia Ali recalled. “It was a little scary for me: I didn’t know anything about the restaurant business. ” Washington was, she said, still a racially segregated city. U Street, known as Black Broadway, was at the heart of African American life. Subject to Jim Crow laws elsewhere, between 1895 and 1920 the number of   businesses in the area mushroomed from about 15 to more than 300. They included thriving bars, clubs and theatres: Duke Ellington grew up and played his first jazz here.  But after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr in 1968, riots erupted along the U Street corridor. At the request of the civil rights activist Stokely Carmichael, the Alis kept the restaurant open past curfew to serve police officers, firefighters and black activists. Sitting at the original bar as staff feverishly prepared   and burgers, Virginia nodded towards the now bustling street. “There was a lot of tension,” she said. “The national guard were out there with big guns. Young people were walking down the street with Molotov cocktails. I could smell the tear gas. I got a little tear gas in my eye. It was a very frightening time. ” In subsequent years U Street suffered decay and disinvestment as the middle class took flight, drug trafficking took hold and storefronts became shells. But Ben’s Chili Bowl stood firm, even during the construction of an underground railway line. Its roll call of famous customers includes Ellington, King, Harry Belafonte, Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald, Jimmy Fallon, Jesse Jackson, George Lopez, Chris Rock, Usher, Bono, Hillary Clinton and then   Obama. The restaurant also appeared in movies: The Pelican Brief with Denzel Washington and State of Play with Russell Crowe. Today, U Street is gentrifying and diversifying, attracting a new generation of affluent urban dwellers and the usual dilemmas around changing character and spiralling prices. Ben’s Chili Bowl’s neighbours include banks, bars, dry cleaners, an Italian market, a tarot card reader, a barre and cycling studio, a yoga studio, an Ethiopian restaurant and the historic Lincoln Theatre. The African American Civil War Memorial and Museum is a short walk away.  On Thursday, Tanesha Willis, 36, came for her first look at the mural. “I think it’s epic, it’s gorgeous actually,” she said. “It’s got people and colours that embody DC. ” The sight of the Obamas made her wistful in the age of Donald Trump, a president accused of reigniting forces of white nationalism. This week the Congressional Black Caucus declined an invitation to meet him.  “It’s sad that as Americans we’ve come so far yet overnight we’ve gone backwards,” Willis said. “People fought for our freedom and we could lose that. A hundred years later people harbor the same hate because of skin colour. ” Bridget Eguakun, 58, a retired staff assistant at the Internal Revenue Service, took photos of the new mural and cited the Obamas, Prince and Muhammad Ali as her favourites.  “I think it’s awesome,” she said. “It’s an African American restaurant and they’re depicting the parts played by African American people. ” She shared the ambivalence of many regarding the exclusion of Cosby.  “He did some wrong but you can’t take away everything he contributed to African American culture,” she said about Cosby. “He’s still a great guy. The University of Missouri just took away his honorary degree but they didn’t give his money back. ” Several onlookers commented that The Cosby Show gave a positive portrayal of a black middle class family in the 1980s, a time when U Street was in disarray and most media portrayals of African Americans focused on crime, drugs and poverty. But Cosby’s legacy has been tarnished by the recent scandal. Brandi Summers, assistant professor of African American Studies at Virginia Commonwealth University, said: “There’s a lot of tension between people in the black community who think Bill Cosby’s been set up because his wealth and power are threatening to white people and they’re trying to take him down, and others who think the women are telling the truth and he’s a predator. ” She added: “Sometimes the burden of black figures is to represent most or all black people and we forget all individuals have their own stories. We invented Bill Cosby as a figure we don’t know the man. The Cosby Show’s legacy can live on but him as a figure is what’s transformed. ”", "bias": {"center": 6.611135408177358e-08, "left": 0.9999999338869011, "right": 1.7448960955256308e-12}},

{"article": "Long dark highways and thin white lines fire roads and Interstates the skeleton frames of   Chevrolets barefoot girls sitting on the hoods of Dodges pink Cadillacs   power drives men who go out for a ride and never come back. Bruce Springsteen’s song lyrics have injected more drama and mystery into the myths of the American road than any figure since Jack Kerouac. He knows this, of course. So it’s one of the running jokes in his big, loose, rangy and intensely satisfying new memoir, “Born to Run” (what else was he going to call it?) that he didn’t begin to drive until he was well into his 20s  —   around the time he landed simultaneously on the covers of Time and Newsweek. His brooding and violent father had been too impatient to teach him and, anyway, he couldn’t afford a car. When Mr. Springsteen was forced to sneak behind the wheel, licenseless, to handle some of the driving on his earliest tours, his ineptitude terrified his band members. He did not exactly, when young and virile, ride through mansions of glory on suicide machines. He mostly stuck out his thumb. He’d been born to hitch. “Every sort of rube, redneck, responsible citizen and   the Jersey Shore had to offer, I rode with ’em,” he writes in “Born to Run. ” These rides matter because Mr. Springsteen’s songs, like the   poems of Philip Levine, are intensely peopled. Wild Billy and Crazy Janey, Johnny 99, Mary from “Thunder Road,” Wayne from “Darlington County,” Jimmy the Saint and Bobby Jean had to come from somewhere. This memoir suggests Mr. Springsteen met many of them while cackling over there in the shotgun seat. The headline news in “Born to Run,” to judge by the early news media tweets, is that Mr. Springsteen, who turns 67 on Friday, has suffered periodically from serious depression. I will admit that this information shook me. If Bruce Springsteen has to resort to Klonopin, what hope is there for anyone? But these sections are not the reason to come to “Born to Run. ” The book is like one of Mr. Springsteen’s shows  —   long, ecstatic, exhausting, filled with peaks and valleys. It’s part séance and part keg party, and then the house lights come up and you realize that, A) you look ridiculous dancing to “Twist and Shout” and, B) you will be driving home in a minivan and not a Camaro. His writing voice is much like his speaking voice there’s a big, raspy laugh on at least every other page. There’s some raunch here. This book has not been utterly sanitized for anyone’s protection, and many of the best lines won’t be printed in this newspaper. Most important, “Born to Run” is, like his finest songs, closely observed from end to end. His story is intimate and personal, but he has an interest in other people and a gift for sizing them up. Here’s just one example, chosen nearly at random. When Mr. Springsteen meets a future girlfriend on the boardwalk in Asbury Park, N. J. (one of innumerable girlfriends on display here) he delivers this electric introduction: “She was Italian, funny, a beatific tomboy, with just the hint of a lazy eye, and wore a pair of glasses that made me think of the wonders of the library. ” Well, hello, you think. Much of the writing in “Born to Run” is this fresh  —   the sound of a writer who could have phoned his book in but did not. There are dollops of pretension and   in “Born to Run. ” Springsteen wouldn’t be Springsteen without homilies, a few of them leaden, about fathers and sons and love and work and community. But this book mostly gets away clean, leaving behind the scent of lightly scorched rubber. Mr. Springsteen’s father was a frequently unemployed bus driver, among other   jobs his mother a legal secretary. They were fairly poor. In their houses  —     more often  —   there was generally no telephone and little heat. Meals were cooked on a coal stove. “Born to Run” is potent on the subject of social class. In Mr. Springsteen’s part of New Jersey it was the “ ” (preppies) versus the greasers, and there was no doubt which side of that line he was on. At some of his early shows, guys in chinos spat on him. “I could still feel the shadow of that spit that hit me long ago when I moved to Rumson in 1983, 16 years later,” he writes. He’d found fame and bought a decent place. Yet: “At 33 years old, I still had to take a big gulp of air before walking through the door of my new home. ” He suggests there’s a freight of psychic payback in “Darkness on the Edge of Town,” his most fully realized album. “For my parents’ troubled lives I was determined to be the enlightened, compassionate voice of reason and revenge. ” Mr. Springsteen got his first guitar, a rental, after seeing Elvis on “The Ed Sullivan Show. ” He had a serious work ethic, and went on to play in a string of   bands with names like Child and Earth and Steel Mill. When his   first record, “Greetings From Asbury Park, N. J.,” appeared in 1973, he was lumped with the   New Dylans, folk singers like Loudon Wainwright III and John Prine. But there was a crucial difference. Unlike those performers, Mr. Springsteen onstage, thanks to his long   apprenticeship, could blow audiences backward. Mr. Springsteen writes that he’s never thought much of his singing voice. As good a guitar player as he is, others were better. It was his songs, he realized early, that would have to put him over the top. If this book has one curious blind spot, it’s that we never quite understand how those words came into being. He studied the songwriting of people like Mr. Dylan, Donovan and Tim Buckley, he writes. But so did many others. If his early reading was an influence, he doesn’t say. The words were apparently just there, available, on tap. And they stayed there, even when his lyrics became pared down. Songs like “The River” and “Stolen Car” are as evocative in their details as are Raymond Carver’s best short stories. “Born to Run” takes us, album by album, through his career. These chapters sometimes feel clipped and compressed, as if he’s wedged the data in his heart onto a thumb drive. The book takes us through his many stabs at romance, which tended to end badly. (He once gave his father the crabs after they’d shared a toilet seat.) He details the failure of his first marriage, to the actress Julianne Phillips, and the success of his second, to Patti Scialfa, whom he describes, in a childhood photo, as “a   Raggedy Ann of a little girl. ” He raised his three children without   mementos in the house. “My kids didn’t know ‘Badlands’ from matzo ball soup,” he writes. “When I was approached on the street for autographs, I’d explain to them that in my job I was Barney (the   purple dinosaur) for adults. ” His eldest son says, in shock, “Dad, that guy has you tattooed on his arm. ” Mr. Springsteen’s work ethic has never abandoned him, or he it. “I’m glad I’ve been handsomely paid for my efforts,” he writes, “but I truly would have done it for free. ”", "bias": {"center": 0.0036546290590109215, "left": 0.9963439703486631, "right": 1.4005923260057987e-06}},
{"article": "Clinton Cash author and Breitbart News Senior Editor Peter Schweizer talked about Donald Trump’s   to his book, and Hillary Clinton’s response with SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon on Thursday’s Breitbart News Daily.  “We’ve all seen the stories, and know the stories, about Wall Street firms or Big Oil companies trying to influence our politicians, but there’s always been this consensus that politics is a dirty game, but it’s played by Americans,” Schweizer noted. “That has changed now with the Clintons. That consensus is gone. ”  “You cannot, according to U. S. federal law, as a foreign government or a foreign corporation, write a check to a political candidate. You can’t set up a Super PAC and try to influence an election,” he explained.  But when the Clintons established the Clinton Foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, when Bill Clinton hit the lecture circuit while his wife was Secretary of State, you now had an avenue where oligarchs in Russia, in Nigeria, in Latin America  —   if they wanted something from the Secretary of State, they now had an avenue to try to influence them. I think the evidence is pretty clear they gave a lot of money. There’s pretty clear evidence that favorable actions were taken on Hillary Clinton’s behalf  —   by her, for their benefit. “This is totally new in America, and the question is, this goes beyond the Clintons ultimately, because if this is allowed to continue, this will become the wave of the future,” he warned. “One thing we know about Washington, D. C.: if you give a politician a way to   it’s going to be imitated by everybody, in both political parties. ”  When Bannon asked where the mainstream media has been on the Clinton Cash story, which he described as “one of the biggest scandals in the history of the country,” Schweizer replied, “It’s not only ‘where have they been?’ They have a complete lack of curiosity about it. ” “Think about this for a second,” he urged.  Set the book aside, and look at the fact that the New York Times ran a     piece on how the Clintons got $145 million from the shareholders in this small Canadian company that was being sold to the Russian government, and the State Department approved. That’s a heck of a story right there. When the New York Times runs a front page piece, 4, 000 words, on a subject like that, it generally gets attention. Here’s the challenge: CNN, MSNBC, no one has asked Hillary Clinton a single question about this story. This is a story that ran a year ago. Not a single question. Bannon suggested the media is keeping away from the Clinton Cash story because they know it’s a “time bomb” that could devastate her campaign, as Trump demonstrated by bringing it up Wednesday. “They’re afraid of the answers if they do pursue this,” he said. “It’s got to be something,” Schweizer agreed. “It’s as if something like Watergate was broken, you have the early murmurings of Watergate, reporting by Woodward and Bernstein, and other reporters said, ‘Yeah, that’s interesting, but we’re really just not even going to ask a question about it.’ It is absolutely bizarre. ”  “It’s interesting to watch this unfold. You’ve got some good reporters at some of these outlets that we work with, that have done great reporting on this sort of subject, but you’ve got a lot of frankly lazy reporters  —   or you’ve got management at those news agencies, as you said, that are just not interested in having these stories surface, because of where they’re heading” he charged. For that reason, Schweizer said this has become “a story about the media, and how the media does its job, or doesn’t do its job,” as much as it’s about the Clintons. It also ties into the story about Hillary Clinton’s illicit email server, since as Bannon observed, it’s becoming increasingly clear that server was designed to shield Clinton’s activities and financial dealings from Congress and the Freedom of Information Act. Schweizer said he was convinced Clinton deleted the 30, 000 emails supposedly concerned with yoga routines and party planning because “it’s about these commercial relationships, it’s about follow the money. ” “They needed a way to communicate,” he said. “Bill Clinton is off flying on a plane, doing whatever, wherever he is. Hillary Clinton is Secretary of State, she’s flying the world, doing whatever she’s doing. You’ve got the Clinton Foundation, you’ve got this money apparatus. You have to have a way to communicate. The way you communicate is via email. And, in order to communicate that way, it has to be secret, because the mingling of official State Dept. business with the personal profiteering of the Clintons is not something that can see the light of day. ”  “So the apparatus becomes setting up this email server, and the notion that nobody’s going to find it. Well, you have this Romanian hacker that uncovered this, and I think it’s another example of how elites globally try to operate  —   pull the wool over the eyes of people, but somehow, some way, innovative people around the world uncover this stuff. That’s something that gives me hope for the future,” said Schweizer. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern.

(Dorothea   of Congress)  The border between the United States and Mexico has been in the headlines for a while now. From issues of immigration to executive orders to tariffs to the animals that live along the nearly    boundary, it is not only one of the   international borders in the world, but one of the most heavily   areas. But the border itself is hardly new. The boundary was established in 1848 after the U. S   War ended with the Treaty of  . But it wasn’t until the turn of the 20th century that Mexico’s own revolution and subsequent border wars, followed by the Great Depression, prompted the United States to send soldiers, push Mexicans out of the country and strongly enforce its southern border. In 1924, Congress passed the Labor Appropriation Act, officially establishing the U. S. Border Patrol for the purpose of securing the borders between inspection stations. And in 1934, the first Border Patrol Academy opened as a training school in El Paso. In her book “Line in the Sand: A History of the Western U. S.  Border,” Rachel St. John writes that today’s border apparatus stems from the 1930s. At that time, Dorothea Lange, a Farm Security Administration photographer best known for her iconic Migrant Mother image, visited the border near El Paso. Given that the United States at that time was poorer than Mexico today, Lange’s photos have a familiar air about them. The inspection of goods. The impatience and eagerness of waiting. The anticipation of opportunity. The determination. Lange’s images, while uniquely of their time, capture both the recognizable signs of bureaucracy and the timelessness of life on the periphery.

{"article": "These arguments exist within a tradition of using the specter of fraud to legally suppress votes on a racial basis. But for decades that tradition has relied on a wink and a nod —  openly stating the discriminatory intent of laws that had the clear effect of disenfranchisement could be legally troublesome. The dog whistle is the key. The Toxic Health Effects of Deportation Threat, Just days into his term, President Donald Trump opened a new chapter in this long history, using the White House pulpit to make claims of massive voter fraud, and calling for changes in voting law. But in relaying an anecdote to congressional leaders intended to support his wholly unsubstantiated claims of millions of fraudulent votes from undocumented immigrants, Trump directly referred to the perceived ethnicity and nationality of suspect voters, instead of actual suspicions of fraudulent acts. In doing so, Trump broke the longstanding taboo of relying on racial insinuation to carry the implied threat of suppression. The story, as reported in the New York Times, is bizarre. According to multiple sources, at a reception for House and Senate leaders Trump relayed a story meant to back his wild claims of fraud. That story involved German golfer Bernhard Langer. Three sources claim that Langer —  a German citizen ineligible to vote in the United States —  saw voter fraud by people he presumably believed to be undocumented immigrants, while trying to vote unsuccessfully himself. Another source contradicts this account, saying the story was relayed to Langer by a friend who was eligible to vote. But both accounts agree that Trump’s take from Langer was that a group of voters presumably of Latin American origin “did not look as if they should be allowed to vote,” as paraphrased by the newspaper. This was a bullhorn where we’d usually expect a more savvy  . As recently as the latest election cycle, the dog whistle was king. Republicans sounded the alarm early and often about reports of mass   voter fraud, despite no evidence that it exists. Republicans also rallied around the suspicion of undocumented immigrants registering to vote —  again, a claim that remains unsubstantiated. Both of these claims that themselves invoke a certain threat of people of color and immigrants voting were used to justify voter suppression. Although the courts struck down some of the most egregious voting laws like North Carolina’s with its racial “surgical precision,” on the whole there were more voting restrictions in place in 2016 than in previous elections. Further, those laws were likely just a prelude to a slow dance of legal challenges that could seriously weaken the Voting Rights Act under a Trump administration. Trump himself played along with the   game on the campaign trail. Without evidence, he repeatedly claimed that there were millions of cases of voter fraud in favor of Democrats. He also implied that he might not accept the results of the election as legitimate based on that falsehood, though he later reversed that position after he won the election. But Trump did play by the rules of the   game in using the cover of voter fraud to advocate for policies with histories and implications steeped in racism, such as   and intimidation in Democratic strongholds in neighborhoods of color. Despite the apparent contradiction of claiming a legitimate victory and also maintaining a claim that millions of people cast votes illegally, Trump carried these claims into office, becoming the first president to demand an investigation into an election he won. The genesis of these claims seems largely rooted in ego and perhaps a touch of distraction —  Trump has been clearly rankled by losing the popular vote, and a focus on vilifying an   of minorities for tainting an election could serve as a   pressure valve amid swirling allegations of Russian interference on his behalf. But Trump has also tied these claims of voter fraud to the larger Republican aim of “strengthen[ing] up voting procedures. ” In clarifying statements, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer outlined that the investigation would focus on states and places that did not vote for Trump. How much distance is there between such an investigation and an imposition of draconian voter rules on communities of color? Historically, not much. The game that Spicer is playing here relies on the things unsaid as much as the things said. In the wake of the Voting Rights Act and 52 years of changes in polite society since, naked voter suppression through outright violence and legal mechanisms openly targeted at black Americans has become anathema. The rabid segregationists of old were no longer tolerated, but the campaign to reduce the voting power of minorities —  especially in the shadow of the old Jim Crow —  continued apace, and picked up steam, respectability, and a sheen of intellectualism along the way. And the campaign continued so in a manner where intent no longer mattered. After the 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision rolled back federal oversight in southern elections for the first time since the   era, it’s no coincidence that many of those states moved immediately to restrict voting and in North Carolina introduced the legislation on the same day as the decision. Emboldened by United States Chief Justice Roberts’s declaration in the Court’s opinion of that case that the country has changed since 1965, those states seemed intent on proving Justice Ginsburg’s dissenting opinion that the law’s protections themselves had been the source of those changes, and not an eradication of the underlying instinct to disenfranchise. Armed with that decision, so long as they don’t mention race and stick to the script of things like “ballot integrity,” conservatives can likely convince friendly courts and a friendly Department of Justice that increasingly restrictive voting laws do not violate the 14th and 15th Amendments, despite the clear   impact that things like voter ID laws do have. As long as they play the   game, the road appears to be open. Trump has since attempted to back up his claims with misrepresented data from a Pew study, as well as some unreleased reports from voting app VoteStand and its founder Gregg Phillips, a company that does not have comprehensive access to voter data and a person who has not been established as a credible source or expert on voting in any way. In other words, he’s corrected his position back to the standard Republican talking points of using unsubstantiated, shoddy, or willfully misinterpreted data to support claims of fraud, and thus an agenda of more restrictive voting laws that only discriminate in effect, not in intent. But in his story about Bavarian golfers and “Latin American” voters, Trump perhaps inadvertently ushered in a new era. One of the strongest unofficial powers of the office is to set and maintain norms, and if the leader of America is open in using racism to advance   policy, his party at the least should feel emboldened. Maybe Trump just isn’t a deft enough politician to grasp the importance of maintaining the cloak of colorblindness in his calls for voter integrity. But the deeper implication is that such a cloak may no longer matter. After winning an election steeped in some rather overt appeals to racism and hatred of immigrants, why should the new president feel inclined to blunt his language? Underlying all the bemoaning of political correctness in his rhetoric is the Rosetta Stone of Trumpism: that Trump wants to be able to say the thing again. And with that comes a whole new world of possibilities for voter suppression.", "bias": {"center": 7.321489636175945e-08, "left": 0.9999999267851036, "right": 4.4124466571320476e-26}},

{"article": "   Donald Trump, who takes the oath of office in just 15 days, has been publicly smearing the integrity and legitimacy of the US intelligence community on Twitter  —   disputing their assessment that Russia tried to influence the US election and mocking their erroneous   War assertion that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction.     Today, the intelligence community  —   and their supporters in Congress  —   fired back.  In a fiery Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on foreign cyber threats to the United States, the country’s top spies  —   along with several senators from both parties  —   lambasted what Director of National Intelligence James Clapper described as Trump’s ”disparagement” of the intelligence community. “Mr  : When you listen to these people, they’re the best among us and they’re trying to protect us,” declared Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham.     Clapper and others at the hearing also warned of the potential damage Trump’s comments could do to the nation’s ability to work with other nations to confront security threats like ISIS and the continued threat of radical Islamist terror.    “I have received many expressions of concern from foreign counterparts of what has been interpreted as the disparagement of the intelligence community,” said Clapper.   In response to a question from Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich about how the  ’s “dismissive attitude towards the intelligence community” was impacting morale in the intelligence agencies, Clapper tersely stated, “I haven’t done a climate survey, but I hardly think it helps it. ”    Admiral Mike Rogers, commander of the US Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency, went further, expressing his concern that damage to the morale of the intelligence community’s professional workforce could potentially lead to the departures of key personnel. “What we do is in no small part driven in part by the confidence of our leaders in what we do,” said Rogers. “And without that confidence, I just don’t want a situation where our workforce decides to walk. ” Although Rogers himself didn’t mention Trump by name, his comment was striking because he has been rumored to be under consideration to replace Clapper and become the incoming Trump administration’s top spy.    For someone whose signature campaign promise was to “Make America Great Again,” publicly trashing one of the fundamental pillars of the country’s national security apparatus seems an odd way to go about restoring the country’s greatness in the eyes of the world.  What the fight is all about The intelligence community  —   including the CIA, the FBI, the director of National Intelligence, and the Department of Homeland Security  —   has stated unequivocally that the Russian government directed the hacks of the email accounts of Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) with specific intent to influence the outcome of the US presidential election. But Trump has consistently disputed their conclusion  —   which is based on actual forensic evidence, some of which is publicly available  —   suggesting instead that maybe the DNC actually hacked itself. “It could also be China; it could be someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds. You don’t know who broke into the DNC,” Trump said during the first presidential debate. Except that at least four different US intelligence agencies filled with professionals whose job it is to investigate these sorts of things have told us: It was Russia. Period. Full stop. And Trump knew this. He’d already been briefed on it at least once before that first debate. Yet he still said we didn’t know anything about who did it.  That alone was distressing. But back then, he was just a candidate. Now, he’s the man who is about to serve as the commander in chief of the entire US armed forces and the one empowered to dictate what the intelligence community focuses its resources on. Which means that his comments now are far more dangerous.  A president blindly believing everything he’s told is bad. A president trusting Russia more than his own intelligence agencies is worse. A president questioning the accuracy of some piece of intelligence he’s been given is fine  —   in fact, it’s really, really important. Having a president who blindly believes everything he is told without looking critically at the evidence or asking for second opinions can lead to bad decisions  —   like, say, invading Iraq over its supposed WMDs.      But let’s be clear: This is something very different. Trump is not quietly asking the intelligence officials who have briefed him to bring him more concrete evidence that Russia was behind the hacks. He’s not speaking with different intelligence agencies to make sure that this isn’t just the flawed analysis of one agency drowning out others who may be less convinced of Russia’s involvement. Both of those things would be perfectly acceptable. “I’m the first to acknowledge there’s room for a wide range of opinions of the results we generate. We don’t question that for one minute. And every intelligence professional knows that,” Rogers told the Senate panel.  “I have had plenty of times in my career when I have presented my intelligence analysis to commanders and policymakers and they’ve just looked at me and said, ‘Hey Mike, thanks, but that’s not the way I see it,” or “You’re gonna have to sell me on this.’ That doesn’t bother any of us,” he said. But, as Clapper pointedly stated, “there is a difference between healthy skepticism about intelligence information and disparagement.”  And disparagement is exactly what Trump is doing. He’s publicly slandering the US intelligence community and choosing instead to promote the claims of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange  —   an avowed   activist with close ties to Russia  —   that Russia had nothing to do with the email hacks.  As Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill asked, “Who benefits from a   trashing the intelligence community?” It’s a good question.

AIG’s weak results come at a time when the company is facing the possibility of having to set aside more capital as regulators worry about financial firms deemed ”too big to fail”. The insurer’s near collapse in 2008 and its $182 billion bailout by the U. S. government led to its inclusion in the Federal Reserve’s list of ”systemically important financial institutions” (SIFIs). Chief Executive Peter Hancock said in March that a judge’s ruling that MetLife Inc ( ) was not ”too big to fail” opened up an opportunity for AIG to seek an exemption from the designation.

Samuel Merksamer, a managing director at Icahn Capital LP, and billionaire investor John Paulson are expected to join AIG’s board next week. The operating profit attributable to AIG fell 54 percent to $773 million in the first quarter, partly due to restructuring costs of $122 million.

Less than 10 minutes out in the sun, and your iPhone  shuts down with an urgent warning: iPhone needs to cool down before you can use it. ”I’ve wanted to get a picture at 130 degrees, and today I got it,” says Joe Harrington of Aurora, Illinois, who made the impromptu drive from Las Vegas (the official reading is taken in the shade). While a visit this week does make for a story, the park warns extreme heat can be deadly without the proper preparation and precautions.  A few degrees from   high, The heat wave ushering in summer on Wednesday may be breaking daily records here, but it’s not forecast to break the   record of 134 degrees recorded in Death Valley in 1913. Park officials say that measurement is increasingly being scrutinized by scientists, but it still holds against the next hottest temperature of 129. ”I’ll probably never feel this hot again in my life,” says De’mond Singleton. And he knows hot. As he stands in direct sunlight next to the thermometer reading 130 degrees, Singleton compares it to his experience serving with the US Army in Iraq and Afghanistan. ”This is on another level here, this will kill you,” says Singleton, who drove from Lancaster, California. ”I haven’t felt the monster of all heat until coming here.” Like most people, Singleton is experiencing the heat and then getting out. But Randy Humiston isn’t like most people    he’s sleeping in it. The lone camper, There are 136 campsites at the Furnace Creek Campground, but on this scorching hot night (the overnight low is 91 degrees) there is only one spot filled. The camper filling it belongs to Humiston, an amateur geologist who splits his time between California and Hawaii. ”I never had this much space in Death Valley before,” Humiston said. ”I don’t feel intimidated about walking out in my underwear.” Why is he here? Humiston is on the maiden voyage in a camper he bought last year, and Death Valley is his ”favorite place in the world.” ”I figured why not test it in the extreme conditions and find out how she’s doing,” he said. ”And she’s doing quite well.” Park rangers reported a temperature of 110 degrees at midnight the previous night, but Humiston said his AC got it ”down into the 80s.” ”I had to pull the sleeping bag over me at one point,” he says with a defiant chuckle. Still, rangers are discouraging camping during this heat wave. ’Normally hot’ is the most dangerous time, Surprisingly, officials say most   problems occur in ”normally hot” temperatures between 105 and 115 degrees. ”When it’s this ridiculously hot people get out of their car and go ’Absolutely not,’” says park ranger Abby Wines. Last year, two people died in ”average” heat, including a motorcyclist whose GoPro video showed him pull over to the side of the road, become wobbly and then collapse. Aside from drinking plenty of water (a couple of gallons, Wines says) rangers recommend light meals over large ones, which may be tough for the body to handle in a foreign climate. ”It’s like going to a higher elevation for the first time, when you get short of breath,” Wines says. ”The same kind of thing can happen in high heat as well.” And this place is all about high heat. The National Park Service said the area in 1996 had 40 days higher than 120 degrees F (49 degrees C). In 2013, a     tutorial video posted by the park sparked an   frenzy that left park officials cleaning up the mess. Death Valley got its name in 1849 when prospectors heading to the gold fields got lost and stumbled into the harsh desert. International intrigue, Despite the rush of ”thrill seekers” wanting impressive selfies, Death Valley at this time of year is largely an international affair. ”I hope my shoes don’t start melting,” says Stefan Van Groningen of the Netherlands. He and his friends are on holiday, and couldn’t wait to experience both rugged terrain and temperatures they can’t get back home. By July, the park expects 70% of its visitors to be   its brochures are printed in four languages. Wines says locals can get heat by staying home, but that this is unusual for tourists. ”This is very special. It’s so hot and the landscape,” says Francesca, a tourist from Switzerland admiring the park with three friends. For Van Groningen, one of the most dramatic parts of his American journey has been conquering Death Valley’s tempting heat. ”So we can take it in the luggage with us.”", "bias": {"center": 1.8845685247018637e-06, "left": 0.9999981151358663, "right": 2.9560904851739707e-10}}
