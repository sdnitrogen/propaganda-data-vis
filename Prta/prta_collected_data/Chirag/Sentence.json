{"article": "As Hillary Clinton began a meeting with police chiefs from departments around the country, she expressed gratitude to those on the force. ”They represent officers who get up every day, put on their uniforms, kiss their families goodbye and risk their lives on behalf of our communities,” the Democratic nominee said at the Thursday gathering in New York City. During the brief part of the meeting that was open to reporters, Clinton referenced Dallas, where five police officers were shot and killed in July. She also talked about Baton Rouge, La. where police fatally shot Alton Sterling, a    black man, while he was on the ground. Clinton said there’s a lot of work to do to repair trust between communities and police. ”We need to work together to bridge our divides, not stoke even more divisiveness,” she said. Clinton struck a similar theme earlier this week in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. While campaigning before a largely white audience in Scranton on Monday, Clinton mentioned the protests in Milwaukee, which broke out after police shot and killed a black man there last weekend. ”Look at what’s happening in Milwaukee right now,” Clinton said. ”We’ve got urgent work to do to rebuild trust between police and communities and get back to the fundamental principle: Everyone should have respect for the law and be respected by the law.” Clinton’s Republican rival, Donald Trump, also talked about Milwaukee this week. During a campaign stop in the nearby suburb of West Bend, Trump accused Clinton of being   because of her calls for reform of the criminal justice system. ”She is against the police, believe me. You know it and I know it, and guess what: She knows it,” Trump told the crowd. Critics on the left, including groups like Black Lives Matter, have accused Clinton of being too slow to address concerns from   and their allies  —   a key part of the Democratic base  —   about aggressive policing. Clinton herself has acknowledged that tension. ”I know that just by saying all these things together, I may upset some people,” she said. Speaking to the African Methodist Episcopal Church General Conference on the day after the Dallas police shootings, Clinton called for national guidelines on the use of deadly force and better training for police. ”I’m talking about criminal justice reform the day after a horrific attack on police officers,” Clinton said. ”I’m talking about courageous honorable police officers just a few days after   killings in Louisiana and Minnesota.” While Hillary Clinton tries to navigate those conversations, Donald Trump is walking another line. This week, he’s been praising police while promising to bring ”law and order” to   neighborhoods.

{"article": "Washington (CNN) Donald Trump on Monday reiterated his support for the controversial practice of racial profiling by police amid increasing threats to the homeland. ”Our local police    they know who a lot of these people are. They are afraid to do anything about it because they don’t want to be accused of profiling,” Trump said on Fox News on Monday. Trump pointed to how Israel used profiling and ”done an unbelievable job.” Trump did not say on what attributes he would encourage police to profile possible suspects, but It’s illegal for police to subject US persons to disparate treatment based on their race or other protected status.  ”They see somebody that’s suspicious, they will profile,” Trump said. ”Look what’s going on: Do we really have a choice? We’re trying to be so politically correct in our country, and this is only going to get worse.” RELATED: Trump labels Clinton ’weak and ineffective’ in wake of bombings, Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, disputed that Trump meant police should start ”racial” profiling. ”I mean if authorities are going to look the other way, then at least we have a presidential candidate who is telling the Americans who say, ’I’m are so tired of looking the other way’ we don’t have a vetting process, we don’t have borders,” she told CNN’s Erin Burnett on ”Outfront” Tuesday. ”We have people so worried about political correctness that look at what this did the other night, people were injured.” The man suspected in Saturday’s bombings in New York and New Jersey was captured Monday after a manhunt and shootout. Ahmad Khan Rahami is suspected of bombings Saturday in New York City and Seaside Park, New Jersey, and is believed to be connected to pipe bombs found Sunday night in Elizabeth, New Jersey, sources told CNN. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declined to comment on the issue of profiling Tuesday. But Trump’s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, defended Trump’s comments. ”I think it’s all about common sense,” Pence told MSNBC’s Kelly O’Donnell. ”Talking with law enforcement officers, they’ll tell you that today they feel like they operate in an environment of political correctness, where they can’t use common sense to be able to target resources and target their energies against individuals who would be the most likely potential threat to our families and to the safety of our communities.” Trump ’bets’ terror suspect not on a watch list, Pence acknowledged the difficult balance between smart policing and respecting civil liberties, but cited Rahami as an example of how political correctness can hinder law enforcement.  The FBI said Tuesday that Rahami’s father was interviewed after a tip alleging that he called his son a terrorist, but the FBI never investigated Rahami or placed him on a FBI database of potential terrorists. ”I don’t know why that occurred but it smacks of the kind of political correctness and eggshells that law enforcement feels that they have to walk on in the environment that we’re in today,” Pence said. ”Of course it can (go wrong and infringe upon people’s rights) but we’re talking about common sense profiling.”", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> Washington (CNN) Donald Trump on Monday reiterated his support for the controversial practice of racial profiling by police amid increasing threats to the homeland. ”Our local police they know who a lot of these people are.

{"article": "After making it to the top, Barack Obama is looking down. In October, the outgoing president signaled that he will focus on   politics when he leaves office. This promise took on new urgency after the election, which left Republicans in control of 32 statehouses and 33 governor’s mansions, not to mention both chambers of Congress and the White House. “One of the big suggestions that I have for Democrats as I leave   …     is how do we do more of that   building?” the president told NPR in December. “What I’m interested in is just developing a whole new generation of talent. ” Obama seems to be taking part in the larger process of soul searching among Democrats. “I wonder, sometimes, whether the Democratic Party has contributed to [a decline in local politics] by making the president and the federal government the fulcrum of so much, and suggesting that we can solve these problems from the top down,” said David Axelrod, the former senior Obama administration advisor, during a recent panel discussion at the University of Chicago. “Democrats have ceded a lot of statehouses and legislatures. Congress has been gridlocked. And the notion has been: What can the president do with the power that he has to try and create some progressive action? It just puts a lot of weight on the presidency, when maybe we have to be a bit more innovative. ” The Atlantic  Politics  Policy Daily: Congress Clocks In, These explanations are not primarily philosophical. They’re about winning. In the face of painful electoral losses, Democrats are rediscovering the strategic case for activism at the state and local level. Yet there are deep historical and ideological reasons why the party has tended to focus on the federal government as a means of making policy. An ideological shift would be much more important, and is more unlikely, than a strategic one. As Democrats move to focus on state and local politics in 2017, this distinction between ideology and strategy will be important to watch. The party, and progressives more broadly, could take up a friendly posture toward state and local governance on the grounds that Americans should directly influence the laws that constrain them and the policies that supposedly benefit them. Alternatively, this sudden impulse toward state and local organizing could prove instrumental and temporary, doomed to reversal whenever the party wins back the U. S. Senate or the White House. Democrats’ approach to federalism will matter for the future of the party and the permanence of its policies. But ultimately, it will show what Democratic leaders really believe about people’s proper role in their government. For some progressives, a renewed focus on state and local politics is primarily about obstructing Washington Republicans. Heather Gerken, a Yale law professor, wrote a piece for Vox about why the left should embrace federalism in the coming years —  essentially, she argued, it offers ways to counteract federal policies. “Progressives at the state and local level can influence policy simply by refusing to partner with the federal government,” she wrote. “If blue states and cities refuse to implement Trump’s agenda, Republicans will sometimes be forced to compromise rather than pay a political and fiscal price. ” For others, local politics are more important in their own right. “We think there’s a lot of importance in protecting local democracy,” said Nikki Fortunato Bas, the executive director of the Partnership for Working Families, a network of regional advocacy organizations that work on economic and environmental issues. “It’s in the communities [where] we live [that] we’re most connected to the need of our neighbors, and lawmakers are most connected to the needs of their constituents. ” Regardless of their reasons for wanting to focus on state and local politics, Democrats will be limited by the enormous imbalances of party power in governors’ mansions, state legislatures, and city halls. Especially during Obama’s second term in office, the party lost control and influence in a number of statehouses. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, the party controls roughly half as many state legislatures as it did in 2010, and roughly half as many states will enter 2017 with a partisan split compared to the same year. Similarly, Democrats have been losing governships steadily since Obama took office in 2008: Compared to the 29 states held by Democrats that year, the party now holds 16. The only place where Democrats still dominate across the country is in large cities, where they control many city halls. The unevenness is partly a reflection of progressives’ reluctance to push their policy agendas through states. Historically, arguments against federalism —  or the principle that power should be robustly shared between state and national governments —  have centered on race. “Progressives are deeply skeptical of federalism, and with good reason,” Gerken wrote in a 2012 essay in Democracy. “States’ rights have been invoked to defend some of the most despicable institutions in American history, most notably slavery and Jim Crow. ” Others see the decentralization of governing power as a way of stifling dissent, she argued. This is one reason why the national Democratic Party has often looked to Washington to make and enforce policy. But there’s another ideological explanation, argued Ernest Young, a professor of law at Duke University, in an interview: The progressive project is ultimately about working toward a society built on one unified vision of policy and culture, rather than a diverse array of policies and cultures. “If you’re confident that you can get the right answer to something, like   policy, or welfare, or any number of very difficult social problems, it’s hard not to say that right answer should be equally available to everyone,” Young said, meaning that progressives believe their “right answers” should be legislated through federal policy. “If you’re a more Burkean type of conservative, and you’re skeptical that we’re ever going to find out right answers to these questions, you might favor different solutions in different jurisdictions, and see from experience what works out. That tends to lend itself to a commitment to federalism, and local governments, too,” he said. Not all progressives believe that most policymaking should happen at the federal level. Especially in recent years, some policymakers have looked to cities and municipalities to lead reform efforts. “Cities were the original sites of disruption: They disrupt class orders they disrupt social practices they disrupt businesses,” said Jennifer Bradley, the director of the Center for Urban Innovation at the Aspen Institute. No matter what Obama and other national Democrats may say, this work has already been in progress, she added. “This notion that Democrats were relying too heavily on the federal government is belied by eight years of what actually happened,” she said. In part because Washington is so dysfunctional, “cities and states have learned to rely less and less on the federal government, and I think that trend will sharply accelerate. ” Practically speaking, the narrative that progressives favor federal policymaking while conservatives favor state and local action is far too simplistic. Both parties tend to use federal power when they have it. “George W. Bush, as a matter of ideology, cared a lot about states,” Young pointed out. “But the first thing he did as president was to shift power to the federal government in the area of education, which had been a terribly important area of state predominance. ” Conversely, both parties have used   litigation to intervene in federal policymaking when they’ve been out of power. Take Massachusetts vs. Environmental Protection Agency, the   Supreme Court case in which 12 states, several cities, and advocacy groups sued to force the EPA to begin regulating greenhouse gases. During the Obama years, other states pulled a similar move —  Texas sued the administration over deferred immigration enforcement for people in the country illegally, for example. “Broadly, I think federalism is not a conservative or liberal thing, or a Republican or Democrat thing,” Young said. “It offers a way of not having all your eggs in one basket when changes in who controls various institutions occur. ” It’s also a way of making sure one party doesn’t force the other permanently out of power at the national level: As Democrats are now discovering, it’s hard to get elected in districts that   state legislatures have gerrymandered to favor their own party. But there’s a reason why the United States is not a constellation of    . Federalism is a political orientation, not a body of   policy prescriptions. The negotiation of power between national and state governments —  and, relatedly, between state and local governments —  is complicated and partisan. Larger bodies of government, led by Democrats and Republicans alike, often threaten smaller bodies with litigation or funding cuts if they don’t follow certain policies. During the Reagan years, the federal government famously used this method to get states to comply with its policy on the legal drinking age. And in 2016, the Obama administration used a similar method when it sent a letter to school districts instructing them to comply with federal guidance on accommodations for transgender students. States often write laws limiting cities from legislating certain issues as well. North Carolina’s H. B. 2 may have been the most notorious of these kinds of prohibitions in 2016: Among other things, the statute prohibited cities from passing   ordinances to protect LGBT residents. Preemption on LGBT issues is fairly new, according to the Partnership for Working Families. States preempt cities and municipalities most frequently on issues like transportation regulations,   standards, labor agreements, and policies on earned sick days, the organization reports. If national Democrats are truly interested in revitalizing state and local governance, perhaps they’ll push to repeal these kinds of preemption laws, which force policy decisions into the realm of larger and larger legislative bodies. Or maybe they’ll swear off executive orders, on which the Obama administration heavily relied, whenever they eventually regain federal power. It’s not like voters are big fans of the federal government, anyways: According to Pew Research Center, Americans’ trust in bodies like Congress has been declining for at least the last decade, while their belief in state and local bodies is much higher and has remained relatively constant over the years. This might be the most compelling of all arguments for a new era of federalism: Voters simply don’t like or trust the federal government. As a new administration prepares to take office, “The one thing I really hope states and locals can do is model a different kind of political behavior,” Bradley said. “What I would hope is that the actions of state and local lawmakers can restore people’s faith and trust, honestly, in democracy. ”", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> After making it to the top, Barack Obama is looking down.

{"article": " U. S. President Barack Obama’s foreign policy legacy rests in part on a foundation of unilateral actions that his successor Donald Trump could reverse with the stroke of a pen. Due to take office on Jan. 20, Trump, the winner in Tuesday’s election, campaigned at times to dismantle Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran and to reimpose sanctions Obama eased on Cuba. Trump also disagreed with foreign policy decisions that included the way Obama has deployed troops abroad to combat Islamist militant groups. In his most notable foreign policy achievements, Obama, a Democrat, used executive authorities that offered a convenient legal path around a   Congress committed to blocking his agenda. The U. S. Constitution gives a president broad executive powers to enact foreign policy. Both Republican and Democratic presidents have sought to exercise those powers by issuing executive orders, presidential memoranda and what are called findings. ”He (Obama) relied on executive authority to build a foreign policy legacy,” said Thomas Wright, director of the Project on International Order and Strategy at the Brookings Institution.  ”That is all vulnerable to countervailing executive authority by a Trump administration,” Wright said. Obama had hoped to pass his legacy on to Democrat Hillary Clinton, his former secretary of state, but she lost the presidential election to Trump, a Republican businessman who has never held public office or served in the military.  TRUMP PLANS UNCLEAR Often contradicting himself during the campaign, Trump made it difficult to know for sure what policies he would pursue. Major constraints include budget caps, laws he cannot reverse without Congress, and the pressure that will emerge to replace policies he chooses to abandon. Trump said in an October speech that he would ”cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama” on his first day in office, without saying who would determine their constitutionality. A Trump spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday on his latest plans. EXECUTIVE ORDERS, ENACTED & RESCINDED Perhaps nowhere has Obama faced more congressional opposition than in his pursuit of the 2015 deal with Iran, which Republicans and some Democrats said put too few restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program in return for too much sanctions relief. Trump has vowed to dismantle it, although his statements on the deal have been contradictory. A president may tighten and relax economic sanctions by executive order. ”Anything enacted by executive order can be rescinded by executive order,” said Zachary Goldman, a former U. S. Treasury official now at New York University. Obama drew enough support from Democrats to block a   resolution rejecting the Iran deal, achieving a political victory but falling short of a consensus.  Trump will have the added advantage of working with a U. S. Senate and a House of Representatives controlled by fellow Republicans. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said on Wednesday he hoped Trump would ”see how much he can undo the unilateral actions the president took all by himself, which would not require us.” CUBA, DRONES Breaking with longstanding U. S. policy on another issue, Obama restored diplomatic ties with Cuba in 2015. But facing opposition in Congress to lifting a broad economic embargo, especially from Republicans, he used executive actions to ease some U. S. sanctions. Obama capped his Cuba efforts last month with a sweeping  ”presidential policy directive,” which also is reversible and sets forth mandates for government engagement,    exchanges, and greater U. S. business ties. Trump has taken contradictory positions on whether he supports the embargo or not. Obama’s aides said the easing of restrictions was aimed at securing enough benefits for U. S. businesses and travelers that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for any Republican president to reverse the opening to Cuba. Trump could roll back Obama’s efforts to create greater transparency about drone strikes. Obama issued an executive order in July requiring annual disclosures about such strikes. MILITARY POWER As    Trump will wield the power to mobilize the U. S. military on short notice and without first seeking approval from Congress. Obama deployed U. S. troops to Iraq, Syria and Libya to help fight the Islamic State militant group by relying on the authority Congress granted President George W. Bush to battle al Qaeda. That same authority would allow Trump to ramp up U. S. deployments in fights against Islamist militants if he chose to do so. One former U. S. intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the president can approve covert action and needs only to brief relevant leaders in Congress once the operation is under way. Trump’s powers, however, are limited. He pledged to expand the Army, grow the Marine Corps, boost the Navy from 276 to 350 ships and submarines, and raise the number of Air Force tactical aircraft from 1, 100 to 1, 200. For starters, that would require that Congress scrap government spending caps under the Budget Control Act. Trump’s support for   an interrogation technique that simulates drowning, also would meet opposition. Congress last year passed legislation barring the use of waterboarding and other ”extreme interrogation techniques” widely considered torture. Obama signed the measure into law last November.

S. President Donald Trump on Friday at the G20 summit in Germany will last about 30 minutes and probably not lead to any major agreements, Mexico’s foreign minister said on Wednesday. NEW YORK The U.

But it’s really weird, because it’s like the last eight years, now it feels like a lie. Like, this has been festering underneath the whole time. Racists, sexists. And a lot of these people, they don’t know why the fuck they’re alive. They know it. They’re doing drugs, fucking killing themselves. Because they’re like, ‘Why the fuck am I alive? I can’t get a job, I don’t know anything about anything, I have no curiosity for life or the world.’ So this Trump thing is like getting a box of firecrackers, or something. It’s like, ‘Well, this will be fun for a little while, this’ll kill some time.’ Because, y’know, the jackass will be amusing on television, stay stupid shit. Make everybody clap. Hillary would have been too boring, I suppose. It’s the worst thing that’s ever happened. It’s the worst. This guy is going to destroy civilization as we know it, and the earth, and all because of these people who don’t have any idea why they’re alive. Shannon, who earned an Oscar nomination for his role in the 2008 film Revolutionary Road, said that despite being an   actor, he hasn’t lost touch with the real world. “I don’t mean to sound cocky, but I guess the one thing I always try to do, I always resist the notion that I’m sort of star or something,” he said. “I still walk down the street, take the subway, try and stay in the real world as much as possible.

{"article": "Here’s a surprise news flash: Millennials are getting more of their news on cable TV. In the first quarter, Fox News attracted the highest number of millennials  —   famously addicted to their smartphones  —   with 67, 700 of those aged between 18 and 34 tuning in. That’s up 250 percent from the same period two years ago, when just 27, 100 millennial viewers were glued to Fox News, according to Nielsen data obtained by The Post. CNN isn’t far behind. It grew millennial viewership to 62, 900 from 34, 800 in 2015, while MSNBC just notched 35, 900 in the first quarter versus 20, 400 in the comparable period two years earlier. To be sure, millennials are the first generation to grow up attached to their digital devices, and the latest   figures aren’t big numbers when compared with the hundreds of millions of   that social networks like Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat notch each month. Still, data show a surprising trend  —   namely, that all three news networks grew the number of young adults watching their broadcasts on both a   and   basis. “It’s really the political climate,” says Billie Gold, director of programming research at Amplifi, a division of ad agency Dentsu Aegis Network. Millennials are “very socially conscious. They care about the environment and all the protests  —   they’re very concerned. ” Nonstop chaos in Washington, an investigation into Russian interference in the elections, wiretapping claims and allegations of fake news have made watching the news a nonstop reality show of epic proportions. Ratings typically fall off a cliff after an election, but this year, the audiences have held up, Gold notes. With the TV “upfronts” looming  —   a seasonal confab in which advertisers look to allocate $70 billion in annual budgets around the dial  —   growth in the ranks of young viewers is a welcome data point for news networks that typically skew older. Millennials are a   demographic for advertisers, even though they’re more likely to still live with their parents than at any time since 1880, according to Pew Research. There are now 75. 4 million millennials, who overtook baby boomers last year as the biggest segment of the US population. The news segment is on fire. Fox News, CNN and MSNBC have been hitting record ratings at a time when both general cable and broadcast networks are struggling to hold on to their viewers. In February, broadcast networks lost 11 percent of the commercial ratings in prime time while cable networks were off 10 percent, according to a study dubbed “Winter Is Here,” from independent research firm MoffettNathanson released on Wednesday. Just six networks of the top 25 cable outlets could boast of growth in viewership. Anecdotally, several industry executives told The Post their   kids are sitting down to watch the news with them in the evenings. Digital destinations in the news category are gaining too, according to comScore. “Millennials’ news consumption is heavier than the average digital news consumer” said Andrew Lipsman, comScore’s vice president of corporate marketing.", "sentence": {"content": "<div> Here’s a surprise news flash: Millennials are getting more of their news on cable TV.

{"article": "Liberals are ecstatic that a judge in Hawaii is writing immigration policy for the entire country, and that policy is: We have no right to tell anyone that he can’t live in America. (Unless they’re Christians  —   those guys we can keep out. )[As subtly alluded to in the subtitle of Adios, America: The Left’s Plan to Turn Our Country into a Third World Hellhole, the goal of liberals is for the poor of the world to have a constitutional right to come here whenever they want.  I can’t help but notice that the Third Worlders aren’t moving to liberals’ neighborhoods. After nearly 1 million Rwandans were murdered by other Rwandans in 1994, our government asked itself: Why not bring more of this fascinating Rwandan culture to America? Ten thousand of them poured in. So far, nearly 400 have been convicted in the United States of lying on visa applications about their role in the genocide. And that’s why we have to tighten our belt, America! Massive international investigations don’t come cheap. Almost every immigration case is a con, something we find out every time there’s a San Bernardino shooting and half the familyturns out to have scammed our immigration officials. One hundred percent of the “humanitarian” cases are frauds. Earlier this month, Rwanda’s Gervais Ngombwa was convicted for lying on his immigration application by claiming to have been a victim of the 1994 genocide. In fact, he was a   perpetrator  —   even featured in Rwandan newspaper articles as a leader of the genocide. For most of the last two decades, Ngombwa has been living in Iowa with his wife and eight children in a house built by Habitat for Humanity  —   because no Americans need houses. He came to the authorities’ attention a couple years ago by setting that house on fire after a domestic dispute, then filing a fraudulent $75, 000 insurance claim. Another Rwandan genocidalist living in America was featured in Adios, America: Beatrice Munyenyezi, granted refugee status as an alleged victim of the genocide, even though she, too, had helped orchestrate it. Munyenyezi was living safely living in Kenya when she applied for a refugee visa to America. The welfare is way better here. And, luckily for us, she had a “chronic medical condition” that required constant attention from a New Hampshire hospital. Hesham Mohamed Hadayet arrived in the U. S. on a tourist visa, then immediately applied for “asylum” on the grounds that he was persecuted in Egypt  —   for being a member of an Islamic terrorist group. Being a member of a noted terrorist group cannot be used to block you from coming to America, thanks to Barney Frank’s 1989 amendment to the Immigration and Naturalization Act, because liberals love this country so very, very much. Being a talented neurosurgeon from Switzerland, however, is disqualifying. Hadayet’s refugee application wasn’t denied until he’d already been living here for three years. When he was called in for a visa overstay hearing, he didn’t show up, and the INS didn’t bother looking for him. After allowing Hadayet to mill about America for another year, our government granted him permanent residency and a work permit. On the Fourth of July following the   attack, Hadayet shot up the El Al ticket counter at the Los Angeles International Airport. I guess the Egyptians were right! As bodies were being cleared away from the ticket counter, including Hadayet’s, his wife blamed America for the attack, denying her husband had anything to do with it. “He is a victim of injustice,” she explained. “In America, they hate Islam and Arabs after Sept. 11. ” At least immigrants are grateful. Immigration bureaucrats are so determined to transform America without anyone seeing what they’re doing that the INS initially refused to release Hadayet’s file to congressional investigators, in order to protect his “privacy. ” Of course, anybody could miss Egypt’s designating someone a terrorist. And maybe the INS’s test for Rwandan “refugees” is: Would this person be able to convince Rolling Stone magazine that “Haven Monahan” raped her? How about Rasmea Yousef Odeh? She waltzed into America after having been convicted and imprisoned in Israel for a supermarket bombing that left two Hebrew University students dead, and also for the attempted bombing of the British consulate in Israel. She was released in a prisoner exchange  —   whereupon Odeh made a beeline for the U. S. True, Odeh wasn’t subjected to the   vetting accorded the humanitarian cases, like the Boston Marathon bombers (we were warned by Russia) Hadayet (we were warned by Egypt) or the Blind Sheik (same). But how did our immigration authorities miss a CONVICTION FOR BOMBING IN ISRAEL? Apart from the terrorism, welfare, and fraud, what great things did any of them do for our country? Ngombwa was a custodian at the Cedar Rapids Community School District in Iowa, a job that, evidently, no American would do. Munyenyezi had a job as an advocate for refugees  —   just one of the many jobs being created by immigrants. Hadayet ran a failing limousine company and was $10, 000 in debt. Odeh was an unemployed waitress and a Palestinian grievance activist. Recently, she’s been heavily involved in     male protests, because who doesn’t like incessant Third World unrest? In 1960, 75 percent of the   in America were from Europe. Today only about 10 percent are. More than a third of all post —  Teddy Kennedy act immigrants  —   not just the wretched humanitarian cases  —   don’t even have a high school diploma. What is the affirmative case for this? How is it making America better? Improving the schools? The job market? Crime? The likelihood of terrorism? Can the liberals doing cartwheels over a district judge’s announcement that everyone in the world has a right to come here (except Europeans and Christians) give us the   analysis they’re using? Twenty million Third World immigrants give us ( __ ) terrorists, ( __ ) welfare recipients, ( __ ) uncompensated medical costs, ( __ ) discrimination lawsuits, but it’s all worth it because ( _________________ )?", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> Liberals are ecstatic that a judge in Hawaii is writing immigration policy for the entire country, and that policy is: <span class=\"technique4\" id=\"row0annotation1\" technique4=\"0.39\"> We have no right to tell anyone that he </span><sup class=\"technique4\" id=\"row0annotation1\">4</sup> can’t live in America.

The   Address Downtown Dubai building was completed in 2008 and contains 196 luxury hotel rooms and more than 600 apartments, according to its website.

{"article": " The U. S. dollar rose against the yen on Tuesday on    U. S. housing data and expectations for a hawkish Federal Reserve, but remained below a recent   high in thin holiday trading.  The S&P CoreLogic   composite index of home prices in 20 metropolitan areas rose 0. 6 percent in October from a revised 0. 5 percent in September on a seasonally adjusted basis. This outpaced expectations of economists polled by Reuters for a 0. 5 percent increase. The data helped underscore expectations that the Fed would raise interest rates at a faster pace next year, a view that gained traction after the Fed on Dec. 14 projected three rate hikes next year, up from the two foreseen in September. The data also sent U. S. Treasury yields higher.  Trading was thin as markets in Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Hong Kong were closed for holidays.  ”The prospect of Fed tightening next year is keeping bonds under pressure, yields up and the dollar bid, and obviously the   data is helping that,” said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York. The dollar extended its gains to a fresh session high against the yen of 117. 60 yen   putting it up about 0. 4 percent against the Japanese currency on the day, in the wake of data showing U. S. consumer confidence hit its highest in more than 15 years in December. The dollar remained below a   high of 118. 66 yen touched Dec. 15 and a   high against a basket of major currencies touched Dec. 20. The dollar index . DXY, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was last up just 0. 06 percent at 103. 070, below the   peak of 103. 650. Analysts said the dollar’s uptrend looked intact, even as 120 yen and parity with the euro remained out of reach for the greenback on Tuesday.  ”The dollar has been and is likely to continue to be supported by expectations that a new administration in Washington is going to be inflationary and thus, force the Fed to raise U. S. borrowing costs at a faster pace in 2017,” Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington, in a research note.  Sterling was last down 0. 34 percent   against the dollar at $1. 2255, with analysts attributing the drop to concerns over next year’s Brexit negotiations. The euro   was last mostly flat against the greenback at $1. 0457.   (Reporting by Sam Forgione; additional reporting by Patrick Graham in London; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama) U. S. credit card processor Vantiv agreed to buy Britain’s Worldpay for 7. 7 billion pounds ($10 billion) on Wednesday in a move expected to trigger further deals.

{"article": "’  ’ ’     In Britain, McDonald’s fries have four ingredients: potatoes,     vegetable oil, dextrose, and salt.   ’ ’     In the U. S. McDonald’s fries have a whopping 19     ingredients —  including sodium acid pyrophosphate, which keeps     the fries’ color from getting dull. This is strange since you’d     think that all we really expect of French fries is for them to     at least vaguely mimic the color of a potato.   ’ ’     Then there’s McDonald’s strawberry sundae. In Britain’s     version, all the color comes from real strawberries. In the     U. S. we use Red No. 40. This plays out beyond the fast food     chain: For example, Starburst fruit chews are colored with     carotenes and chlorophylls across the Atlantic but with Red No.     40 and Yellow No. 6 in the U. S. Many major food companies in     the U. S. use artificial food dyes in America —  while selling     naturally colored or   versions in Europe.   ’ ’   Chemicals like Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5, and Blue No. 1 make   American food look better. These additives are the culinary   equivalents of lipstick and mascara, and they are often made from   the same pigments. Making food pretty has become the status   quo in the U. S. but it’s not doing us any good: Not only does it   trick us into thinking some foods are healthier than they are,   but the dyes themselves may be harmful. So why do we use   keep using these dyes when so many other countries manage without   them? ’ ’   It wasn’t always this way. Until the     century, natural food dyes from   plants, animals, and minerals were used to color food in the U. S.   Things changed when companies discovered artificial dyes which   were cheaper, brighter, and more stable than their natural   counterparts. Artificial dyes made food look more attractive,   which made them popular with consumers. America is a relatively   young and expansive country, and a major historical concern   involved feeding a growing population while moving food large   distances. Food was treated like a commodity, with market forces   shaping what were most valued: cost, convenience, and appearance.   For decades, there was little push to fret —  as Europeans did —  about   what was actually in our food. We just wanted it to look good. ’ ’      Lancet  ’ ’  ’ ’   After the Lancet study was published, some   academic skeptics who had doubted parental claims that food dyes   affected the behavior of healthy children admitted they might   have been wrong. In 2010, the European Parliament passed a law   requiring warning labels on products with any of the six tested   food dyes, and banned the use of food dyes for infants and young   children, effectively ridding much of the European food   supply —  which had low amounts of artificial food dyes to begin   with —  of artificial food coloring. The doses used for some of the   kids in this study, 20 to 30 milligrams of artificial food   coloring, were not as high as those typically ingested by   American children —  in fact, kids often consume far higher doses   than what was found to be harmful in clinical trials. ’ ’   The Food and Drug Administration reacted differently to the same   evidence. A  stated   that a causal relationship between dyes and hyperactivity was not   conclusively established based on available research, though the   report conceded that dyes made symptoms worse in children with   ADHD and other preexisting behavioral problems. Since this report   was published, evidence that food dyes cause problems has   continued to mount.  stated that   the negative effects of food dyes on children’s behavior weren’t   confined to those with ADHD. The latest  from the Center for Science in the   Public Interest, released in January, lamented the FDA’s inaction   and cautioned, “the harm to children and the costs to society   from dyes are needless and preventable. ” ’ ’   It is true that pulling conclusive, universal findings from   scientific research is a difficult task. Sure, there may be   evidence suggesting harm from food additives, but some of the   research was performed in animals and may not apply to humans.   More   research is needed to determine what happens   when healthy people ingest typical doses of common food   additives. We still don’t understand exactly what could be   causing the negative effects food coloring seems to have on kids   with certain conditions. All of these caveats are important to   recognize. ’ ’   But when it comes to food coloring, why should we have to prove   just   exactly how and why the   substance causes a negative effect on the people who consume it   before we can ban it? If this were a necessary or meaningful food   ingredient in any way, sure, that would be a reasonable standard.   But food coloring has no nutritional value. Why are we risking   it? ’ ’     ’ ’  ’ ’   Most likely because it helps companies sell products. Pretty food   pays off because aesthetics in food do matter. We have relied on   visual cues for thousands of years to help us determine what is   edible, nutritious, and safe to eat. Man has adapted to   appreciate natural colors, including a variety of green, red,   pink, orange, yellow, and purple produce: Colors signal that food   is ripe or that it contains healthy compounds. Because of that   evolutionary background, color is money for food manufacturers.   Children are especially attracted to a variety of bright, vibrant   colors and succumb to targeted marketing. Food dyes make   processed food more appealing. For example, margarine was   originally white —  manufacturers wanted to tint it yellow to appeal   to the public. Butter producers objected, saying this would   deceive the public. (In fact, butter is also naturally pale and   dyed yellow.) ’ ’   Food aesthetics can also affect how we perceive   taste.  when subjects   were given sugar water in different shades of red, they reported   that the deep red drinks tasted sweeter than the light red ones.   We’ve been primed to expect certain things from certain   colors:  showed   people had a harder time identifying drink flavors when the   drinks didn’t have the expected colors (an   drink   that was really   tasted like an orange). We expect   what nature has taught us, and even though our food system has   changed radically in the past several decades, our expectations   have yet to catch up. Food companies can instead use this   knowledge to trick us and make their processed products appear   more palatable. ’ ’   The reason why food coloring is still allowed is wrapped up in   the different approach the U. S. takes to food regulation. A key   element of the European Union’s public health protection policy   is the “precautionary principle,” under which credible evidence   of danger to human health merits protective action despite   scientific uncertainty. Unlike the EU, the U. S. government sets   high standards for proof of harm before regulatory action is   taken. In fact, the FDA’s “Generally Recognized as Safe” (GRAS)   designation, introduced in 1958, allows companies to evaluate   their own substances and deem them acceptable themselves, after   which the FDA can review the evaluation —  if it wants to. While   this makes sense for ingredients like salt and pepper, GRAS lets   producers take new food additives to the market without even   informing the FDA. Trans fat was classified as GRAS until the   label was withdrawn in 2015. ’ ’   As ingredient lists in other parts of the world show us, it’s   possible to still get basically the same experience without the   potentially negative consequences. Consumer demand can drive   change. Parents and activists have been petitioning food   companies to remove dyes for years, and some are   obliging: In February, candy giant Mars agreed to remove   artificial food coloring in all of its human food products over   the next five years. Mars’ recent decision echoes those made by   other food industry behemoths including Kraft, Nestle, and   General Mills. We’re lucky to have producers take this action,   but we shouldn’t have to wait for their benevolence. ’ ’     Last month, six former commissioners of the FDA met in Aspen,     Colorado, to critique the agency. They pointed out that     thousands of food additives are a part of our food system     because of the GRAS loophole, one that leaves safety decisions     to the producers rather than the FDA. We should tell the FDA     that we demand more: It is their job to keep us safe from these     unnecessary chemicals. In the quandary over brighter mac and     cheese and the risk of hyperactivity, the answer is easy —  let’s     tone down our food.   ’", "sentence": {"content": "<div> ’ ’ ’ In Britain, McDonald’s fries have four ingredients: potatoes, vegetable oil, dextrose, and salt. ’ ’ In the U.

{"article": " (CNN) Well, I’ll be the first to admit, I got caught off guard on this one. If indeed the assessment of the cockpit voice recording of Germanwings Flight 9525’s final moments is an accurate one, it is shocking. It is inconceivable to me that a fellow pilot would use an airplane for his demise and the demise of his passengers. It is my hope that there is more to this uncanny, horrific tragedy than just an extraordinary suicide event. Although a report of normal breathing from the   in the moments before the crash indicates that he was not incapacitated, how can one really tell? A farfetched idea, but could he have suffered a fit of schizophrenia never diagnosed, or suffered some other mental disorder, perhaps brought on by medication? I know, it’s not likely. As an airline pilot, I’m taking this incident personally. Why? A pilot betrayed the public trust. With all the other fears    terrorism, disappearances of planes, aircraft malfunctions    how do I reassure my passengers that they should not add medical illness, mental or otherwise, of the pilot to the list? For the moment, I’ll have to believe that my customers are intelligent enough to realize that the Germanwings   is an anomaly. Sure, as with any profession, pilots have isolated cases of   troubles. But we have mechanisms to deal with such problems. One mechanism is very simple: Don’t fly. It is incumbent upon us to determine our own fitness for duty. As a matter of fact, on every trip, I have to confirm that status before I electronically sign the flight plan. Whether it’s as simple as suffering from the common cold or suffering from the distraction of a nasty divorce, airline pilots can just say ”no” to flying. As part of the hiring process, we completed a psychological evaluation. With my airline, one part of the evaluation involved a written test that asked obscure questions in different ways. Another part of the test involved pilots listening to an air traffic control recording made during the angst of a thunderstorm event while at the same time completing a battery of math and   problems. We were then asked questions specific to the conversations between the air traffic controllers and pilots we’d heard in the recording. The test was a measure of our multitasking abilities and our abilities to deal with stress. In addition, the airline’s doctor conducted an individual mental evaluation. Airline pilots in the United States are required by the Federal Aviation Administration to take a medical examination once every six months. The examination is mostly physical, but the doctor is expected to ask some basic mental health questions, most of them about depression or alcohol consumption. In addition to requiring pilots to indicate any prior health issues during the previous six months, the application for the exam also compels us to   the use of medications, specifically for the treatment of depression.  If we have consulted a therapist, that also has to be disclosed. Yes, all bets are off if we deceive the system by hiding things from it, but by every indication, this rarely occurs. The consequence for deception is having your FAA pilot’s license suspended. When it comes to experiencing stress, airline pilots are no different than anyone else. But we tend to deal with stress internally. I have been trained as a peer support volunteer in   stress management, a joint program between the pilots union and my airline uses as a debriefing method to talk pilots through any serious event experienced in flight.  The idea is to mitigate any   stress associated with such an event, and occasionally the process would uncover personal issues that would be referred to other support providers, like mental health professionals. I have found that my colleagues demonstrate an   ability to compartmentalize their problems and not let personal issues affect their job performance . .. most of the time, of course.  If personal issues invade the cockpit, mechanisms are in place to assist. What mechanisms? At my airline, both the company and the pilot’s union work in unison. Programs to assist a pilot experiencing problems are just a phone call away. And if there is concern about a colleague’s mental health, we can contact one of these programs on the other pilot’s behalf, anonymously if necessary. In some circumstances a pilot can be removed from duty. At every recurrent training period, the curriculum includes a presentation reminding us of these mechanisms. No system is perfect. Yes, as with all human systems, somebody will fall through the cracks. Even a good psychiatrist can miss an impending suicide. Redesigning an airplane cockpit based on the infinitesimal chance that another Germanwings   is out there seems like an overreaction.  If passengers require reassurance of my sanity, then it would be best to more actively promote the mechanisms already in place. We can start with education.  As I fly back from London today, I am certain that the Gulf War Air Force hero beside me, who dealt with enemy missiles and raising a family, will do nothing other than an exemplary job.

{"article": "       You can see the exact moment last week that Donald Trump made up his mind on whether women would face criminal punishment once he signed new restrictions into law. He is at a town hall with MSNBC’s Chris Matthews, and, after Matthews badgers him for a while, he finally answers the question. “The answer is . .. that,” Trump says, eyes looking to the side in thought, “there has to be some form of punishment. ” He punctuates “has” with a hand gesture. Done. Final.     But as it turns out  —   and as it has turned out repeatedly over the course of his life  —   that was not, in fact, Trump’s final position on the subject. This past week alone, he has held multiple contradicting positions, including that one. So we figured that a timeline was in order, so that you could see the date and time and know, concretely, what Trump’s abortion position was at that moment. Though he might deny it. April 1989 Trump   a dinner at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan (which he then owned) honoring Robin Chandler Duke, a former president of NARAL. He chose not to attend, the New York Times reported, after his family was threatened by   activists. Oct. 24, 1999 Ten years later, Trump appeared on NBC in an interview with Tim Russert. In a clip that has received newfound life during this election cycle, Trump defends his broadly liberal positions by explaining that he grew up in Manhattan, not Iowa. Asked about abortion, he’s clear.  “I’m very ” Trump says. “I hate the concept of abortion. I hate it. I hate everything it stands for. I cringe when I listen to people debating the subject. But you still  —   I just believe in choice. ” Russert clarifies his original point: Would you ban   abortion? “No,” Trump replies. Between 1999 and 2011 At some point between 1999 and 2011, Trump’s position on abortion changed. He explained the reason for his switch during the first debate of 2015. [W]hat happened is friends of mine years ago were going to have a child, and it was going to be aborted. And it wasn’t aborted. And that child today is a total superstar, a great, great child. And I saw that. And I saw other instances. In 2011, as he was toying with running, he told activists at the Conservative Political Action Conference that, among other conservative positions, “I am   [and] against gun control. ” June 28, 2015 Shortly after announcing his candidacy, Trump appeared on CNN in an interview with Jake Tapper. He got a little tripped up. TAPPER: Let me ask you about a few social issues because they haven’t been issues you have been talking about for several years. I know you’re opposed to abortion. TRUMP: Right. I’m  . TAPPER: You’re   or  ? TRUMP: I’m  . I’m sorry. March 30, 2016, 2:30 p. m. The interview with Matthews is taped, and Trump asserts that women who receive abortions once the procedure is illegal will face punishment. The men are involved will not, he adds. News of the comments quickly leaks. March 30, 2016, 3:30 p. m. Before the MSNBC town hall even airs, a spokesperson for Trump releases a statement changing what he told Matthews.   . @realDonaldTrump statement on abortion: says it should be put back to the states and he’s pro life, like Reagan. pic. twitter.   —   Ali Vitali (@alivitali) March 30, 2016  March 30, 2016, 5 p. m. About an hour later, Trump’s campaign releases a more formal “statement regarding abortion. ” It’s different than what he said to Matthews and his initial statement. “If Congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts upheld this legislation, or any state were permitted to ban abortion under state and federal law,” the statement says, “the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman. ” (It’s worth noting that this is in line with the   movement’s position.) The statement includes a snippet written in the first person: “My position has not changed  —   like Ronald Reagan, I am   with exceptions. ” April 1, 2016, 6:30 p. m. CBS releases an excerpt of its interview with Trump that aired Sunday morning. Asked again about abortion, Trump’s position seems to change yet again. “The laws are set now on abortion and that’s the way they’re going to remain until they’re changed,” he said, according to CBS’s transcript. “I would’ve preferred states’ rights. I think it would’ve been better if it were up to the states. But right now, the laws are set. ... At this moment, the laws are set. And I think we have to leave it that way. ” Understandably, this is not  . The   group Susan B. Anthony List replies that he had “disqualified himself as the GOP nominee” if this were his position. Trump also offered a reason for his initial comments to Matthews: “I’ve been told by some people that was an older line answer and that was an answer that was given on a, you know, basis of an older line from years ago on a very conservative basis. ” April 1, 2016, 9 p. m. Again before the program airs, the Trump campaign   what the candidate said. “Mr. Trump gave an accurate account of the law as it is today and made clear it must stay that way now  —   until he is president,” it read. “Then he will change the law through his judicial appointments and allow the states to protect the unborn. There is nothing new or different here. ” Should Mr. Trump’s position on abortion not be anything new or different again in the future, this article will be updated.

{"article": " (CNN) There’s a pioneering education nonprofit in Boston that uses stories of past bigotry to teach young people about tolerance. It’s called ”Facing History and Ourselves.” Which pretty much sums up our national challenge for the foreseeable future. Last week, when the Rachel Dolezal media circus was in full swing, the subtext of the coverage and debate was that ”this is all so fascinatingly 21st century.” Coming so soon after Caitlyn Jenner’s transgender declaration, Dolezal’s masquerade raised convoluted, sometimes comical questions about whether it is possible or permissible now to claim race as a matter of mere personal preference. The shooting in Charleston ended that   reverie.  The vicious killings at the Emanuel AME Church on Wednesday reminds us brutally that race in 2015 isn’t only about fluid boundaries, elective minority status, or a postmodern sense of identity in transition. Race    for   especially    is still often a hard social marker. In this case, a target.  There is a sickness in our society, as Senator Rand Paul said, that is about violence and mental illness. But there is a deeper sickness    race hatred    which is ”weaponized” by such easy access to guns. And underlying that is a deeper sickness still: the American penchant for avoiding the past and its meaning. Today    Thursday, June 18    the United States Supreme Court, with Justice Clarence Thomas as the pivotal vote, ruled that Texas is within its rights to ban Confederate flag license plates. Today, the    continues to fly at a Confederate Soldiers Monument in South Carolina. Today, images of Dylann Roof posing with that flag or the flags of   South Africa and Rhodesia went viral. Today is not, as the cliché goes, the first day of the rest of your life. Today is the most recent day of the many lives that came before yours. Rachel Dolezal’s ”race, lies, and videotape” farce was the product of her desire to escape her own history, to claim another group’s history. She could not. She should not have tried.  The Charleston shooting, rooted in a deep tradition of   violence, is also part of an inescapable history. There are too many anguished echoes to tally. There are the church bombings of the civil rights era just half a century ago. There are the lynchings, murders, bombings, riots, and rapes that were the enforcement arm of the unwritten codes of segregation. There is the violence, physical and legal, done to slaves since before there was a Constitution or a United States. This racialized violence was used to make and enforce boundaries of race    and let’s be clear, to define race in terms of blackness versus  . It was not an incidental aspect of the American republic, the Confederate rebellion, or   revivalism today. It is at the very core of our nation’s history and contemporary civic life. We have to reckon with it much more openly. Not ”without judgment,” as people are prone to say in this time of fragile feelings, but with quite strong judgment of history and ourselves: with a   sense that it is possible and necessary both to damn racism and to admit how much of it exists in our own hearts. Except we shouldn’t wait for another Lincoln. We should each, in our own little domains, be another Lincoln. We should open conversations, public and private, about the real history of   racialism as well as racism in our institutions    our churches, our colleges, our companies, our town squares and public buildings.  And not just in the Deep South. That’s too easy. Not even just in a city like Spokane, Washington, which has few  . But also in every part of the North and West where the Great Migration of nearly a century ago changed the face of the big cities. In every part of New England, where so many great arts and education institutions were built on the labor of slaves. You might ask what good all this excavation of the past will do. It won’t equalize educational or economic opportunity for  . It won’t guarantee the voting rights of   citizens. It won’t protect   from police brutality or common criminality. But it will remind us why those tasks matter morally and urgently    and why the hashtag #AllLivesMatter is a defensive and   response to #BlackLivesMatter. It will make us all appreciate the responsibility we share as inheritors of all that is good    and bad    about America.  It’s the American way to blissfully forget history, to think only about tomorrow. But for the slain in Charleston there is no tomorrow. Those of us who are here today must face yesterday squarely, and commit to making a ”new American way ”    of reckoning, reconciliation, and true reconstruction.  Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

{"article": "Thursday night’s   from which the barbaric Assad regime’s   attack against its own people was launched was both   and modest. It was modest because it was focused, targeted and limited. Its specific purpose was to degrade the regime’s ability to work its evil again. In his brief statement, President Trump did not make broad claims or suggest further action was in the offing. He expressed appropriate outrage at the murder of children with gruesome banned weapons, but based his action in   terms  —   as punishment for Bashir   violating the terms of the Chemical Weapons Convention of which Syria is a signatory. The use of sarin, he said, is a threat to the “US and its allies. ” The president is right. Chemical weapons need not, after all, be delivered by plane. They can be carried by individuals and released in confined spaces like the Toyko subway system, where a 1995 sarin attack by terrorists resulted in death and horrible injury to dozens and incidental injuries to more than 5, 000 people. Over the past four years, Assad has been making commonplace what was once all but unthinkable  —   the deployment of a weapon of mass destruction against a civilian population. And he has been able to make it commonplace because the United States under Barack Obama repeatedly refused to respond to these acts of savage barbarity. And this is why I say the military strike was   as well as modest. In the first major test of Trump’s mettle as president, he has just put the world on notice: He is charting his own course in response to   events. This response seems to contradict many things he has said over the past four years about what the United States should do in Syria, and to overrun the words his own secretary of state spoke about Syria last week. That makes this militarily modest action even more geopolitically meaningful. Trump is signaling that his   tweets and his campaign’s naked appeals to isolationism may now be past their   date. Indeed, he sounded less like a cynical realist than a  —   dare I say it?  —   neoconservative. The rhetoric of his brief statement was striking for its moralism: “We ask for God’s wisdom as we face the challenge of our very troubled world,” he said. “We hope that as long as America stands for justice, then peace and harmony will in the end prevail. ” Contrast this with two months ago, when he responded to Bill O’Reilly asking him about Vladimir Putin’s record of killing people with shocking insouciance: “What,” Trump said, “do you think our country’s so innocent?” What a difference a sarin gas attack makes. And North Korean missile tests. Trump approved the strike with the prime minister of China in his company. Xi Jinping and Trump are meeting this weekend with the key subject now being the increasingly belligerent and provocative regime in North Korea. For more than a decade, we have been looking to China to act to end the nuclear ambitions of North Korea by threatening to cut off that regime’s economic lifeline. China has basically refused to act. Trump’s action last night sends a message to Xi and to the rest of the world: Take me seriously.", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> Thursday night’s from which the barbaric Assad <span class=\"technique9\" id=\"row0annotation1\" technique9=\"0.31\"> regime’s attack </span><sup class=\"technique9\" id=\"row0annotation1\">9</sup> against its own people was launched was both and modest.

{"article": "Donald Trump faces a   presidential debate on Sunday night after a torrid 10 days left him trailing Hillary Clinton in opinion polls in key battleground states. With early voting already under way, the Republican candidate has seen his September polling gains wiped out and is fast running out of time to shift momentum back his way in the race for the White House. A live debate always raises the prospect of the   Trump allowing Clinton to get under his skin and making a gaffe that could throw his campaign into disarray. The bombastic billionaire stirred fresh controversy on Friday when, in a meeting with a union representing border patrol agents, he floated a new conspiracy theory, saying that immigration officials were trying to expand the pool of American voters. Trump directly challenged the media to report his remarks, which followed comments by union   Art Del Cueto in a meeting in Trump Tower in New York. Del Cueto told the celebrity businessman: “Immigration is so tied up with trying to get the people who are on the waiting list to hurry up and get them their immigration status corrected . .. so they can go ahead and vote before the election. ” “Big statement, fellas,” Trump said, motioning to reporters. “You’re not going to write it. That’s huge. But they’re letting people pour into the country so they can go and vote. ” Clinton was widely judged the winner of the first debate. Both candidates face a test of stagecraft on Sunday in what has become popularly known as a “town hall” format for their second showdown in St Louis, Missouri, moving around a stage with handheld microphones as they field questions from voters. The first town hall debate was held during the 1992 election. As a voter stood to ask George H W Bush about the national debt, the president glanced down at his watch, an image that seemed to reinforce criticism that he lacked empathy. Clinton’s husband Bill won the election. In 2000 George W Bush was answering a question on leadership during such a forum when   Al Gore rose from his chair and walked peculiarly close to his Republican rival. Bush turned and gave Gore a nod and a smile, prompting audience laughter.  Rick Tyler, a political analyst and former spokesperson for Republican primary candidate Ted Cruz, said of Trump: “From what I can tell from the polls, his prospects in the election are bleak. He’s going to need a   win in the debate if he’s going to stand any chance in November. ”  But the town hall format will not necessarily suit him. “He’s just not an impressive performer when it comes to answering people’s questions,” Tyler added. “He’s not grounded in policy, foreign or domestic. He doesn’t give a lot of thought to issues. He’s missing empathy when someone asks a question, he has trouble connecting at their level. “I think she’ll win it. She has so much more experience at this. She comes across as cold, but she has more skills than he does. ” According to the Real Clear Politics polling average, Clinton is currently 4. 5 points ahead of her Republican opponent in a   race, a poll position that would translate to at least 237 of the 270 electoral college votes she needs to win firmly in the bag, with 165 for Trump and 136 to play for.  There is a glimmer of hope for Trump, however, in polls that show him down but not out in the key swing states that are likely to determine the election outcome, and that suggest his dismal showing in the first debate had only a marginal impact. A survey by Quinnipiac University on 8 September, taking smaller parties into account, gave Clinton a  % lead over Trump in Florida,  % in North Carolina and  % in Pennsylvania. It had Trump up by  % in Ohio. Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, told a conference call on Friday: “Debates are obviously the kind of events that make it possible to have   influence. Right now it’s a pretty fair consensus of our polls and other people’s polls that Secretary Clinton seems to have a small lead, maybe three, four, five points nationally. “In some of the swing states, there’s some results that are just plain different. So we enter the next debate with Mrs Clinton slightly ahead but not gigantically ahead. The other interesting question is how the debates will affect the presidential race. ” The Quinnipiac survey found that likely voters said by margins of more than    that Clinton won the first debate. Brown added: “The poll taken right after that debate happened found there had been a relatively small increase in support for Mrs Clinton, not nearly as large as one might expected given the overwhelming consensus that Mrs Clinton won that debate. ” Brown noted that a large percentage of the electorate in states such as Florida and Ohio will have voted by election day due to   provisions in those states. This is likely to intensify pressure on Trump to arrest Clinton’s momentum. Ahead of Sunday, Trump has reportedly reviewed video of the first presidential debate, and his aides have stressed a need to stay calm and not get riled. He limbered up at a real town hall on Thursday night in New Hampshire but did not interact directly with the audience, taking questions only from a moderator. Trump told the small crowd: “This isn’t practice this has nothing to do with Sunday. This isn’t practice, we just wanted to be here. ” And he made fun of Clinton for preparing in depth. “I said, ‘Forget debate prep.’ I mean, give me a break. She’s resting. She wants to build up her energy for Sunday night. And you know what? That’s fine. But the narrative is so foolish. ” Trump was joined by New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who performed well in the town hall format during his failed presidential campaign and is helping the nominee get ready. The Clinton camp has said it expects Trump to have done more homework this time. “But even if he does show up a little more disciplined than last time, I don’t think he’ll get a second chance to make a first impression,” Clinton spokesperson Brian Fallon said.", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> Donald Trump faces a presidential debate on Sunday night after a torrid 10 <span class=\"technique8\" id=\"row0annotation1\" technique8=\"0.48\"> days </span><sup class=\"technique8\" id=\"row0annotation1\">8</sup> left him trailing Hillary Clinton in opinion polls in key battleground states.

{"article": " The EPA on Tuesday named its first 10 hazardous chemicals  —   most notably asbestos  —   to a new roster of workplace or home health hazards that may result in some of the chemicals being banned. Largely composed of industrial solvents, flame retardants, and workplace cleaners, the announcement of the new list kicks off a   overhaul of how the environmental agency regulates dangerous chemicals. “We now have the power to require safety reviews of all chemicals in the marketplace,” EPA official Jim Jones said in a statement. A June law had required the first 10 chemicals to be named by Dec. 19. Asbestos, a   material that causes mesothelioma cancer, was widely expected to be on the list. Naming the chemicals to the list begins a   review that might lead to their ban. According to the American Chemistry Council, “a chemical’s inclusion in this first group of ten chemicals does not in and of itself indicate anything about the safety of the chemical. ” The industry group said they expected the EPA to conduct detailed risk evaluations before making any decisions on the use of the chemicals. “In order to help ensure the most credible results, it is imperative that EPA engage stakeholders early and often throughout the risk evaluation process, including through peer review and public comment,” the ACC said in a statement. The 10 chemicals on the list are: Asbestos, Carbon Tetrachloride, Cyclic Aliphatic Bromide Cluster, Methylene Chloride,   Pigment Violet 29, Tetrachloroethylene (also known as PERC or dry cleaning fluid)    and  . “While this is an important milestone, this list is just the first 10 of 1, 000 chemicals in need of urgent EPA review,” Scott Faber of the Environmental Working Group said in a statement. He noted the June law also doesn’t cover cosmetics and similar consumer chemicals. One disappointment for environmental groups was the new list did not include lead, known to be a health hazard for decades. Lead was most recently the cause of a public health disaster in Flint, Michigan, where water pipe corrosion led to its widespread diffusion in drinking water. “It is tragic that while children continue to be exposed to ongoing, unnecessary uses of lead in consumer products, EPA is not even starting the process of phasing out these uses with its new authority to regulate toxic substances,” attorney Eve Gartner of the environmental group, Earthjustice told BuzzFeed News by email.

{"article": "One of the four surviving warriors who defended more than 30 American personnel at two U. S. facilities in Benghazi tells Breitbart News he supports Donald J. Trump for president because: “He gets it. ”[“You got a businessman, who knows how to run things, knows how to get things done —  he’s going to have the aggressiveness America needs to have,” said John “Tig” Tiegen, a Marine veteran. Along with Mark “Oz” Geist, a Marine veteran Kris “Tanto” Paronto, an Army Ranger veteran and Dave “Boon” Benton, a Marine veteran and trained sniper, Tiegen contributed to the book 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi.  The book chronicles their fight to beat back repeated attacks along with former Navy SEALs Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, who were killed along with Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and State Department IT specialist Sean Smith on Sept. 11, 2012. Another former Navy SEAL fighting with them is given the cover name of Jack DaSilva. Tiegen said he endorsed Trump for president and was thrilled to have a Monday night slot addressing the Republican National Convention. The Marine said he and his comrades have met Trump and came away impressed by his sincere interest in their story and its lessons for American leaders. “We got to ask him questions and to see if he would give us the political answer or the straight up answer,” he said. “You know? He gave us the straight up answer. Didn’t try to   anything or answer our question with a question. ” Although he and Geist are stepping up to help Trump win the White House, he said the book and their story was not meant to be political, it was meant to be a testimony to the bravery of the four men killed that night. “We just wanted to make sure the four guys were being honored correctly,” he said. “To bring politics into the story of that night would be a dishonor to them. We weren’t fighting for our political parties, you know? We were fighting for each other —  to get out of there alive. ” The Marine said there is still a question about why the Pentagon did not send help that night. It could be something about former President Bill Clinton and his wife,   of State Hillary Clinton, Tiegen said. As president, Clinton abandoned the Army Rangers fighting in Mogadishu and the secretary of state abandoned the 30 personnel  in Benghazi, he said. “You don’t have to be in uniform, to me, the average American always thinks: ‘Hey, if Americans are in trouble, the troops are going to come for you.’ It seems like under the Clintons, they don’t do that. ” When the House Select Committee on Benghazi came out with its final report, Tiegen said he stopped reading it when he got to the part about how the Air Force was unable to send fighter jets because their planes were all broken down for a parts inventory. “Every one in the military knows they are lying when they say a whole entire Air Force base overseas was shut down all the planes were down for maintenance or for training,” he said. “For me that was the red flag, I knew I didn’t have to read their report no more, because I knew they were lying —  that never happens. It doesn’t happen in the U. S. so you know it doesn’t happen overseas on   —  they’re covering somebody’s behind —  maybe they were offered a job with the Clinton Foundation? I don’t know. ” There were military units and assets available to help, such as the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, he said. “The 24th MEU, they were about four hours away from Benghazi. An MEU is a battalion of Marines. They have aircraft that could get there. They have jets that can get there. ” USS Jason Dunham, an   destroyer, was six miles off the coast, he said. “If that ship is there, then there have to be other ships close by, too. ” Privately, people have reached out to Tiegen and his comrades from the Benghazi raid with stories from the inside, such as inside U. S. Africa Command, about what really happened, he said. “We had guys contact us, who were in AfriCom, and they said: ‘Yes, the State Department told us to stand down. ’” Tiegen said, “If I was getting ready to join the military right now, I wouldn’t do it. I’d wait to see who is getting elected —  if it is another Clinton, you don’t know if they have your back if something happens. They will just leave you to hang out to dry. ” With a Clinton in charge, it is hard to make military decisions, he said. “Either a bunch of your guys get blown up or shoot a guy on a motorcycle —  it’s happening all the time over there  —  they don’t know who they can shoot, so that everybody comes home —  because if they shoot the wrong guy, they go to prison. ” Similarly, President Barack Obama has stymied military   and execution because of his emphasis on political loyalty, he said. Generals and admirals who spoke up against the president were fired and relieved, creating a collection of flag officers who place career advancement before duty, he said. “It is really disheartening to know that the generals care more about the politics than what is actually is going on,” he said. “Now, you got all these pansies up in the Joint Chiefs of Staff,” he said. “They have no cojones. They’re going to leave 30 Americans out to die because they have a brunch they have to go to —  like I keep saying: ‘If Pearl Harbor’ was held today, we’d be screwed. We’d all be speaking Japanese. ’”", "sentence": {"content": "<div> One of the four surviving warriors who defended more than 30 American personnel at two U.

{"article": " Cauliflower had become Lauren Hetrick’s   vegetable. “We have it as often as possible,” says the Rockville mother of three. “Once we roasted it, my kids really liked it  —   and they’ll eat anything if you put cheese on it. ”  But for weeks, Hetrick was unable to find any cauliflower, anywhere. Her quest for it “became a joke,” she says. “I went from grocery to grocery,” futilely stalking the elusive object of her family’s desire. “If I found cauliflower, it was $6 and a really little head, like the size of your hand. That’s not going to feed anyone. Well, maybe the guinea pig. ” These are heady times for cauliflower. High demand, unseasonably cool temperatures in farming regions and limited supply are resulting in scarcity or absurd prices for the latest “it” food. How absurd? You may want to sit down for this: $7. 99 for an organic head at the Takoma Park Silver Spring  . In Philadelphia, Weavers Way Food   suspended stocking the vegetable for three weeks out of concern that the lofty price tag would discourage buyers. But demand persisted. Produce Alliance, a consultant to produce distributors, reported in the Christmas week edition of its market review that cauliflower, the veggie that uprooted king kale, was  —   not to get too technical  —   in “ACT OF GOD” status.   Chefs are using cauliflower in various ways, including on pizza. (Stacy Zarin   The Washington Post)  In layman’s terms, this means “high prices and NONEXISTENT supply. ” (The   alarm is the Alliance’s doing. Vegetable shortages apparently make some people extremely anxious.) Long the bland steamed side dish routinely raked around the dinner plate, surreptitiously fed to pets and plants (not that we speak from experience) or cloaked in   cheese sauce in a (mostly failed) effort to fool the family, cauliflower has become beyond cool. It’s as though the kid you ignored through elementary and middle school, to say nothing of excluding from basement   parties, grew up to become the Jennifer Lawrence of cruciferous vegetables. “Cauliflower is getting its time in the limelight and finally getting some love,” confirms Lorri Koster, a   vegetable supplier in California’s Salinas Valley. It’s certainly a favorite of chefs, who are serving   pizza, cauliflower rice, cauliflower cupcakes, General Tso’s cauliflower,   cauliflower, cauliflower patties and cauliflower mash. Chef Dan Barber of New York’s Blue Hill has a celebrated cauliflower steak with cauliflower puree, a timely dish now that cauliflower costs almost as much as steak. And, yes, cauliflower ice cream is a thing.  [D. C. chefs are making cauliflower a star]  A     veggie that can behave like a carb, cauliflower is a monster in the popular Paleo diet, because “it substitutes for rice,” says Paleo blogger Russ Crandall, who runs the Domestic Man website. His readers frequently request cauliflower recipes. CrossFit fanatics, too, are deeply enamored of the   member of the Brassica family. “I’ve been eating more of it than I have in my entire life,” says Bryant Boucher, a CrossFit instructor in Frisco, Colo. who follows recipes on Paleoplan. com. “I fool myself that it’s rice or mashed potatoes. ” Add to these cravings unseasonably cool weather at California and Arizona farms, and you have the makings of a major shortage. Koster says that her firm normally ships 60, 000 cartons a week, each box containing a dozen to 15 heads, but the frost has zapped shipments to 5, 000. “The way demand escalated really caught us off guard,” she says. Which makes for some desperate shoppers, who’ll pay any price to get their hands on the coveted crucifer. “People get crazy about it,” said Robert Cahill, filling orders earlier this week at the Whole Foods in Plymouth Meeting, Pa. for Instacart, an online grocery shopping service. “They’re not happy about the prices, but they’re buying. ” For some, half a head is better than none. When the price spiked to $7, “I split the cost with a friend,” said resourceful shopper MirnaWay of Philadelphia. “We cut the cauliflower right in half. ” Chefs are feeling the pinch, too. Cauliflower is a “huge staple” in Mike Isabella’s collection of Washington restaurants. The   item at his G on 14th Street and at Nationals Park  —   bigger than chicken parm! bigger than the Italian sub!  —   is the $9 roasted cauliflower hero with pickled vegetables, paprika and romesco sauce. Washington has gone from a    town to a     town. “It probably costs me $8 to make it right now,” says Isabella of the sandwich, as the price of cauliflower “has doubled over the past few weeks. ” “It’s kind of scary,” he says, again demonstrating that produce can produce fear, “but we’re not going to change the prices. ” Whew!  [Mike Isabella is a (grand) mama’s boy]  Cauliflower’s time was long in coming. For decades, it was “in broccoli’s shadow. Now it’s the star of the show,” says Christine Keller of CCD Innovation, a food industry trend analyst that pronounced cauliflower the kale of 2015. This year, the firm is crushing on kelp, the vegetable formerly known as seaweed. But Keller says there’s also another    a vegetable so cool it has yet to make the trend report: kohlrabi. “Have you tried it?” she swoons about the turnip cabbage. “Delicious. ” Meanwhile, cauliflower relief may be in sight. Hetrick finally found   heads at the Safeway last weekend for $6, a relative bargain. Another cold snap, though, and those dollar signs could multiply again. In which case, you may have to help yourself to a dollop of kelp.

{"article": "Washington (CNN) Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump could announce his running mate pick before the party’s convention to help drum up excitement heading into Cleveland, a source familiar with the process told CNN.  Trump, who has repeatedly said his choice for vice president was down to as few as four candidates though sources tell CNN the list is closer to seven, and his aides had previously said the pick would likely be announced at the convention. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich are among the finalists, sources confirmed to CNN on Thursday. Christie    a former Trump rival turned top defender    has received the official paperwork for the vetting process, according to a source with knowledge of events. And Gingrich is being ”seriously considered” for the job, a Trump adviser said. In choosing either Christie and Gingrich, Trump would satisfy his desire for someone with political experience who could help him advance his legislative agenda through Congress. The New York Times was first to report Christie’s vetting. The Washington Post reported Thursday evening that Gingrich was also being vetted, with Sens. Jeff Sessions,   and Bob Corker,   also emerging as final contenders, but a source very close to the campaign said the Post’s report was inaccurate. The source added, however, that a surprise choice could also be in store. Trump is also meeting with Indiana Gov. Mike Pence Saturday at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, a source with knowledge of the meeting told CNN. Pence spokesman Marc Lotter told CNN on Friday that the meeting is ”consistent with the meetings that Mr. Trump is scheduling with many key party leaders.” A Trump adviser told CNN Pence is being considered for VP. Trump’s campaign chairman Paul Manafort has been pushing the idea of Pence as his running mate, according to another source.  A top Trump surrogate, Though Christie ran against Trump in the GOP primary, the two have been   friends and Christie quickly endorsed Trump and became a reliable presence at his events after dropping out of the race. The New Jersey governor has not only been one of Trump’s   surrogates, continually defending him against critics, but also one of his closest behind the scenes advisers, according to sources familiar with the relationship.  Road to 270: The 2016 Electoral Map, Trump, speaking with Concord, New   CNN affiliate   on Thursday demurred when he was asked whether Christie or former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown were on his running mate shortlist. ”Well, they’re both good guys. I don’t want to say shortlist but certainly they’re great people,” Trump said. ”Scott was a very early supporter and Chris was very early after he got out. And they’re certainly people I want involved.” For Christie, it has been quite a departure from what he initially sought out to do in 2016: win the GOP nomination. Blunt, with a big personality and a history of electoral success in a reliably blue state, Christie was once seen as a    or perhaps the      for the GOP nomination. Wounded by the fallout from revelations related to top aides deliberately closing lanes on George Washington Bridge as a form of political retribution, Christie still mounted a 2016 bid. In it, he wasn’t afraid to take a few shots at Trump, though he was always quick to point out that he and his wife, Mary Pat, were long time friends of the New York billionaire. ”Showtime is over, everybody,” Christie said while campaigning in New Hampshire in January. ”We are not electing an   . Showmanship is fun but it is not the kind of leadership that will truly change America.” GOP senator says endorsement could hinge on Trump’s running mate, For a brief period at the end of 2015, Christie appeared to have righted his campaign, only to see it come apart under withering attack ads in the lead up to the New Hampshire primary. A disappointing finish in the state led to the end of his run, and, a few weeks later, to the endorsement of Trump. It was a move surprised    and even angered    many of the players inside his presidential campaign, sources say. One said the move was ”such clear careerism    this wasn’t the man I signed up to work for.” Yet Christie has carved out an integral role inside Trump’s orbit. He’s operated, aides and advisers say, as a sort of   counselor of sorts to Trump in recent months    part strategist, part sounding board, part friend, and often (perhaps to the surprise of many in his home state of New Jersey) a calming voice of reason. ”It’s fascinating that I’m now the person that can speak my mind without offending anyone,” Christie told reporters earlier this month. When Trump was getting chastised by others in the GOP for his criticism of a federal judge over seeing a Trump University lawsuit, Christie said the billionaire was perfectly justified. ”In the end, there are always going to be conflicts regarding civil lawsuits. People are always going to express their opinions. Those are Donald’s opinions, and he has a right to express them,” he said. ”I can guarantee you that, you know, people who are going to vote today in (New Jersey) and people who are going to vote in November are not going to make their decision based upon this kerfuffle.” He added: ”I’ve known him for 14 years and Donald Trump is not a racist.” RELATED: Trump vs. the GOP (redux) Behind the scenes his role was more robust    he spent hours that day at Trump Tower, helping Trump craft a statement designed to put the issue behind the campaign, and sticking around to help him craft a subsequent speech. Christie has also been a top recruiter for Trump    both on the endorsement and fundraising side of the campaign. He’s been a regular caller to top GOP donors and activated his own network to try and bolster Trump’s moribund fundraising operation. The former head of the Republican Governor’s Association, he’s also regularly been in contact with GOP governors on the fence    or off it on the side of #NeverTrump    regarding Trump’s candidacy. The calls and meetings are described as cordial, even in cases where the answers are no. But one message has been clear: Trump is going to win    get on board now. It’s advice Christie himself took and could now benefit from more than anyone. He was Trump’s biggest endorsement at a crucial moment in the campaign and that has sparked talk about any number of possible positions inside a Trump administration. He has been the focus of vice presidential speculation for some time, leaving the possibility open when asked by reporters. That has led to no shortage of questions about Christie’s intentions with that endorsement, both among unaffiliated GOP officials, but also former aides. And it hasn’t always been a smooth process. There was the press conference where an entire Twittersphere jokingly wondered whether Christie had been taken hostage. (”I want everyone to know for those who were concerned: I wasn’t being held hostage,” Christie told reporters afterward.) There was the moment it appeared his wife    one of Christie’s top political advisers    appeared to roll her eyes at a Trump attack on Clinton during another press conference. Then Trump, during an event scheduled to help Christie retire his campaign debt, appeared to jab the New Jersey governor about his weight, saying: ”You’re not eating Oreos anymore, are you? No more Oreos for either of us, Chris. Don’t feel bad.” There’s also been Christie’s own political standing    by May, his approval numbers were down nearly 40 points from their high in November 2013. Christie for his part, has brushed all of those issues aside and maintained his endorsement was contingent on one thing: Trump represents the party’s best chance to defeat presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Whatever his reasons, this much is clear: Christie is all in. One adviser who spoke with CNN described Christie as a consigliere of sorts. Late night phone calls aren’t rare    Trump bouncing ideas and strategies off of Christie, complaints as well. But he also listens, this adviser added. That, the adviser said, may be the most important takeaway: Donald Trump, as much as Donald Trump can, listens to Chris Christie. An early Trump ally, Gingrich emerged early in the 2016 cycle as one of Trump’s most vociferous defenders, especially on cable television, where the former speaker has become one of the more colorful pundits. A longtime Washington fixture, Gingrich has deep ties to the nation’s leading lobbyists and has long fashioned himself as a political historian. Gingrich   his political touch during his 2012 presidential run, when he ran a spirited, at times   campaign against eventual nominee Mitt Romney. Gingrich won plaudits in the primary for excoriating the media, most prominently at a number of Republican debates. Yet despite his unmistakable position as a Washington insider, Gingrich was one of the earlier DC elites to repeatedly defend Trump. And his work as a surrogate has long earned him a place on handicappers’ list of those who might serve as Trump’s No. 2. But he said as recently as Sunday that he had not been formally asked to be considered. ”Nobody’s called me. Nobody has said, ’Would you like to be? ’’’ Gingrich said on ”Fox News Sunday.” ”Nobody has said anything.” And some thought his positioning in the Trump veepstakes was weakened by his criticism over Trump’s recent attacks on a federal judge with Mexican heritage who is overseeing a lawsuit against Trump University. Gingrich called Trump’s language ”completely unacceptable.” ”I thought it was inappropriate what he said,” Trump said of Gingrich at one point, adding that he was ”surprised” he would say so.

{"article": "It takes a few episodes of Better Things, the new FX comedy about an actor raising her three daughters in LA, to realize that there aren’t really any men in the series. Something similar dawns on you watching Atlanta, another new FX comedy about two cousins trying to make it in the southern entertainment Mecca’s   scene  —   except instead of men being absent it is white characters. Once you notice that these mainstays of traditional TV sitcoms aren’t here  —   as extinct as the dodo or Ryan Lochte’s endorsement deals  —   you also realize that you don’t much miss them. There are some men in Better Things, of course, but they are relegated to the minor roles usually reserved for women in comedy’s boys’ club: romantic interests and   shopkeepers and other such functionaries. To make the contrast even starker, the main character, Sam (Pamela Adlon) and her three daughters, Max (Mikey Madison) Frankie (Hannah Alligood) and Duke (Olivia Edward) all have dudes’ names.  The white people in Atlanta  —   and there are even fewer of them than there are men in Better Things  —   serve the same purpose that black actors do on other comedies. That is, they serve to make a point about race in America, before disappearing. For instance, a white colleague is seen to use the   around the main character, Earnest (Donald Glover) but not around his much more physically imposing cousin Paper Boi (Brian Tyree Henry) or their gonzo friend Darius (Keith Stanfield). The lack of such characters allows these new, fresh voices to be heard  —   and in both shows, they’re vibrant and engrossing. Better Things is a product of the partnership between Adlon and Louis CK  —   Adlon served as both a writer and   on Louie for several seasons and as CK’s wife on the   HBO comedy Lucky Louie. They created this show together (both serve as either writer or director of many of the episodes) and it shares lots in its DNA with CK’s signature creation. Not only is Better Things about an entertainer trying to raise a group of daughters it’s also an occasionally meandering, philosophical series of vignettes. Adlon’s character, Sam, is much more sympathetic and    than the Pamela we met on Louie. Just as CK is famous for his riff about how his kids are assholes, Sam has the same sort of antagonistic relationship with her children, scoffing at her oldest daughter when she asks her to score pot but then stealing the condom she finds under her daughter’s nightstand for an assignation with a married man.  While there are some   moments of feminism, like Sam’s speech at a women and girls’ empowerment seminar at her daughter’s school, Better Things is searching for a deeper meaning in how to navigate the world as a woman at all stages of life, both the good and the bad. Imagine Inside Amy Schumer were it half as didactic and twice as melancholy. While it sometimes can veer into familiar territories of sitcom schmaltz, Better Things offers essential fresh takes on motherhood, Hollywood and the vagaries of teenage life. Atlanta is as concerned with race as Better Things is about gender. In the show’s second episode, when Earnest finds himself in jail (not to be confused with Ernest Goes to Jail) he sees an inmate who is clearly mentally ill. When the cops say the inmate is imprisoned every week, Earnest wonders why they keep locking him up instead of getting him help. The cops treat him gently until he drinks toilet water and spits it at them then they viciously beat him. It’s comical, harrowing, audacious and sobering all at the same time.  That is what makes Atlanta an even better show than Better Things  —   in fact, one of the best new shows on television in quite some time. Glover is the star and creator of what feels a little bit like a   Girls. Earnest is barely employed, broke, and “technically homeless” as he pursues his dreams of being a rap manager while trying to raise his daughter. Like Lena Dunham, Glover is obviously playing a much less successful and ambitious version of himself.  While Atlanta’s observations are as keen as those in Better Things, the show is much more consistent in its laughs and tone. Atlanta also tackles a variety of subjects almost effortlessly, whether it’s homophobia and transphobia, the cycle of poverty, or the fraught relationship between law enforcement and the black community. Just as in real life, these issues can creep up anywhere and at any time, and Atlanta always has smart things to say about them.  Everything about this program seems new and vital, stylishly shot in hues that make the projects of Atlanta look like they were washed over with honeycomb and steeped in sunlight. The same is true of Better Things. This is a great step for FX, whose recent comedy duds, such as Baskets and SexDrugsRockRoll, deliver the same angsty   schtick that is pervasive in the world of     comedy. Though these new shows share little more than a network, they are also united in their desire to lend a voice to stories that are often ignored or marginalized. They’re both so darn good, audiences might start demanding fewer white guys in just about everything.", "sentence": {"content": "<div> It takes a few episodes of Better Things, the new FX comedy about an actor raising her three daughters in LA, to realize that there aren’t really any men in the series.

Japanese telecom giant Softbank and toy maker Hasbro were rumored at different times to have been interested in acquiring DreamWorks Animation only to have leaks scuttle the talks. The acquisition will see DreamWorks Animation become part of NBCU’s Universal Filmed Entertainment Group and will be led by Chris Meledandri, the current chief of animation unit Illumination, which is behind “Minions” and “Despicable Me. ” Katzenberg  —   who had angled to remain in a leadership position in talks with previous suitors  —   will step aside and be an adviser to the firm. He will also become chairman of DreamWorks New Media, which will house the digital media outfit AwesomenessTV, which is   by Verizon and Hearst. Shares of DreamWorks Animation were up more than 24 percent to $39. 97 in afternoon trading.

{"article": "Michael Novak loved the Catholic Church and the United States passionately. And with his death at 83, both Church and nation have lost one of their most imaginative and accomplished sons: a groundbreaking theorist in philosophy, social ethics, religious studies, ethnic studies, and economics a brilliant teacher a winsome journalist and apologist a great defender of freedom, as both ambassador and polemicist a man of striking energy and creativity, some of whose books will be read for a very long time to come, and in multiple languages. In his last weeks, however, my thoughts turned, not to Michael’s scholarly and literary accomplishments, which others will celebrate, I’m sure. Rather, I thought of the man I knew for almost three and a half decades, and with whom I shared various adventures. Some of them, recollected here, may shed light on aspects of his character that might have escaped the attention of his admirers, as they certainly escaped the attention of his detractors. When I moved to Washington, D. C. the following year, I quickly came to see how Michael Novak and his good friend James Billington, then the director of the Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars, were making the nation’s capital an environment in which religiously informed moral reason was in play as in no other great world center. Jim Billington did this by quietly ensuring that the Wilson Center’s fellows included theologians and religious philosophers with a feel for applying their craft to the contingencies of political life, and then putting them in touch with the town’s movers and shakers. Michael did it by being himself in conversation with a wide range of Washingtonians, and by helping make the American Enterprise Institute a think tank where the software side of the democratic project was scrutinized for its weaknesses, and where possible improvements, informed by the biblical view of the human person, were imagined. There was nothing like that, then, in London or Paris and there isn’t today. But there is in Washington, and that is in no small part due to the work and the personal example of Michael Novak. Sweating it out in Naples. In the early 1990s, Michael, Richard John Neuhaus, and I all had books published in Italian editions by Mondadori, and the firm’s chief, the estimable Leonardo Mondadori (whose ardent Catholicism coincided with a social circle that included Bianca Jagger) insisted that we all come to Italy for presentations of our books in various forums. Even worse awaited us in Naples, where Leonardo Mondadori had arranged for a more academically focused session at which three Italian professors would discuss our books with us. Or so we thought. The event was held in a reconditioned monastery in the hills above the city, but despite the altitude the room was infernally hot and the Italian colleagues were infernally  . An hour and a half into the program, neither Michael, nor Richard, nor I had said a word, and Richard’s patience was wearing thin. When the Italian academics finally quieted down, Richard began by saying that, given the hour and the temperature, he would follow the dominical injunction to “Be merciful as your heavenly Father is merciful” (Luke 6. 36) and confine his remarks to five minutes I followed suit. But Michael, sensing that something more was expected of us, saved the evening by talking with great clarity and precision about the contributions John Paul II had made to Catholic social doctrine, explaining how these ought to be of interest to even the most   Italians. It was a bravura performance, and a lesson in patience and perseverance that I tried to follow in the years ahead. Take me out to the ballgame. It must have been in the mid 1980s when I took Michael to old Memorial Stadium in Baltimore for an Orioles game on a glorious spring evening. There was one feature of that old    horseshow that never failed to move me: As you came up one of the cement ramps to the upper deck, you caught a glimpse of the infield and a part of the outfield beneath the overhanging mezzanine section of the ballpark. That first sight of the greensward each season was always redolent of renewal, and as Michael and I shared that sense of vernal reawakening, the sharp crack of a   ball leaving an ash bat and heading for the bleachers rang through the stadium. “Greatest sound in sports,” I said. “Except for ‘swish,’” Michael immediately replied, thus revealing himself as a hoops man at heart. I’ve watched countless hours of games with a vast number of people over the past six decades, on site or on television: but I have never met anyone, anywhere, who got such intense pleasure out of sports as Michael Novak did. And not “intense” in the Bill Belichick sense of the   scowl, but “intense” as in sheer pleasure. Michael being Michael, that passion for our games overflowed into his writing, including the book he wanted to call “Balls” until an antsy editor talked him into something a little more, er, delicate: The Joy of Sports. But whatever the title, it was a book replete with insights that could come from only a passionate fan who had played the games and then thought seriously about them: baseball’s freedom from clock time as a signal of transcendence and its unique combination of individual achievement and team play as the embodiment of the “communitarian individual” football as “the liturgy of the bureaucratic state. ” The thought of never having the opportunity to watch another game with him, swapping stories and   managers and coaches, is not a happy one. But if heaven is the perfection of earthly goods, we’ll pick up the conversation in a place without instant replay, because the umps and refs always get it right. Teacher par excellence. In 1992, Michael started a summer seminar in Catholic social thought that I took over in 1999, and that will have its 26th session in Cracow in July. As various ailments began to wear away at his physical capacities, Michael stopped coming, Cracow not being a city very friendly to people with difficulties getting about. But several years ago he asked if he could participate again, if just for a few days, and I readily agreed. The economics section of the program, of which he was once the star, was being covered by others, so Michael spoke about his first love, philosophy, and the modern experience of nothingness. He was not a histrionic lecturer, but his soft and rather high voice, surprising when you first heard it coming from such a big man, had a mesmerizing quality, and my colleagues on the faculty began to understand why Michael was voted teacher of the year two of the three years he taught at Stanford. But it was less his lectures than his interactions with our students  —   young North Americans and central Europeans, all doing graduate studies  —   that I found most striking. They vied to push his wheelchair along the cobblestoned sidewalks of the city and jammed small restaurants to have lunch with him. He always had time for any number of questions. And in addition to what he brought to our work intellectually, he offered a model of patient counseling and courteous listening that our students will long remember. And it was only then, more than 30 years after we had first begun to collaborate, that I came to understand that Michael  —   author, intellectual, diplomat, counselor to presidents and friend of a pope  —   was, in terms of his professional life, first and foremost a teacher. What gave him the greatest satisfaction was seeing others get the light of understanding in their eyes and the joy of discovery on their faces. He would, I think, be willing to be judged by the world on that, his vocation as a teacher: and the judgment would, if just, be a very favorable one.,", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> Michael Novak loved the Catholic Church and the United States passionately.

{"article": "Readers and staffers, primarily from Portland, Oregon, discuss and debate the various issues surrounding race, ethnicity, and class in the city. (The ongoing conversation was spurred by Alana Semuels’s article “The Racist History of Portland, the Whitest City in America. ”) If you have something to add, especially as a Portland native, please send us a note: hello@theatlantic. com. Alana’s recent piece on the racist history of Portland, Oregon, my hometown, cites a controversy that I remember: One incident captures how residents are failing to hear one another or have any sympathy for one another: In 2014, Trader Joe’s was in negotiations to open a new store in Albina. The Portland Development Commission, the city’s   agency, offered the company a steep discount on a patch of land to entice them to seal the deal. But the Portland African American Leadership Forum wrote a letter protesting the development, arguing that the Trader Joe’s was the latest attempt to profit from the displacement of African Americans in the city. By spending money incentivizing Trader Joe’s to locate in the area, the city was creating further gentrification without working to help locals stay in the neighborhood, the group argued. Trader Joe’s pulled out of the plan, and people in Portland and across the country scorned the black community for opposing the retailer. [Local historians] say that during that incident, critics of the African American community failed to take into account the history of Albina, which saw black families and businesses displaced again and again when whites wanted to move in.  A reader pushes back with a little more background: In this particular case that was a local black developer who had long been very active in the Albina neighborhood community who had gone through a quite lengthy negotiating process to develop that piece of land. [RIS note: The developer, Majestic Realty, was in fact based in California, but had hired a local   company, Colas Construction, as general contractor.] That piece of land, by the way, was a large, undeveloped brownfield that sits along a primary commercial corridor that had been vacant for over a decade, and it STILL sits there fenced off and growing weeds. There was no notable “neighborhood opposition” to the Trader Joe’s development UNTIL The Portland African American Leadership Forum [PAALF] a group virtually unheard of in the community until they challenged the TJ’s development. I wasn’t living in Portland when the Trader Joe’s deal fell through, but I remember the vacant lot. It’s located at Alberta Street and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, a busy thoroughfare that in the 2000s used to be lined with   restaurants, parking lots,   buildings, roadside bars —  more of a street to funnel people through than one to build community over, and one where my parents were skeptical of a teenage girl waiting for the bus. In 2013, according to an interactive map by The Oregonian, that intersection (represented by a green dot below) was in the heart of a food desert, with a significant number of   residents living more than half a mile from the nearest supermarket: That   data makes this particular case —  of a supermarket being shut out —  feel like a loss. Whatever the problems in the process of opening this lot for development, Trader Joe’s could have brought affordable groceries to the area. From The Oregonian: Grayson Dempsey, an   King resident who can see the vacant lot from her window, said she tried offering her support at neighborhood association meetings, but her voice was drowned out by the opposition. “I moved here when there were gunshots out the window,” Dempsey said. “I appreciate that (PAALF) is trying to talk about the origins of gentrification. That’s really essential, but they can’t stand up and say, ‘As residents of the King neighborhood, this is what we want.’ The residents of the King neighborhood want this to happen. ”   …      “We shouldn’t leave lots empty in the name of preserving the neighborhood,” she said. “Are we preserving the vacant lot history or do we want to bring it back to a vibrant neighborhood where people know their neighbors and feel safe walking around?” Fortunately, it’s looking now like the controversy will have a happy ending.  Last year, city officials announced that a different store, Natural Grocers, would be built on the vacant lot —  and that the development plan would also include building affordable housing on another   lot nearby, addressing activists’ concerns about local residents’ displacement. Meanwhile, St. Johns, the North Portland neighborhood where I grew up —  historically   and racially diverse, though seemingly segregated from street to street —  has been gentrifying rapidly too. The change is signified by the New Seasons, a regional, more affordable version of Whole Foods, that just opened up a few blocks from my parents’ house, replacing the   shuttered diner that had replaced a   McDonald’s. My mom, who’s been waiting for years for the stores nearby to carry more organic meat and produce, is thrilled. Yet she’s noticed the Fred Meyer supermarket around the corner has phased out its fish sauce and canned coconut milk, and drastically reduced its   selection. What used to be a full aisle of affordable Asian and Hispanic foods has been cut down to about six feet of shelf space. To compete with New Seasons, a clerk told her, Fred Meyer has changed its stock —  getting rid of brands targeted at local minority populations, while expanding its range of pricier,   products favored by young white professionals. “It’s like they’ve segregated us,” my mom says, half laughing, about the shrinking shelf space. Of course, it’s complicated: She hasn’t made a habit of buying her soy sauce at Fred Meyer for years. Instead, she drives out to East Portland or Beaverton to stock up at the Asian stores, where the soy sauce and patis —  Filipino fish sauce —  comes cheaper and in bulk. Still, Fred Meyer, where the cashiers know her face and remember her   son as a toddler, is where she goes every week for convenience, when she wants to stay close to home. It’s where she used to shop when she had young children and no time to drive out to the suburbs, and where she’d have to shop now if she didn’t have a car or an artist’s flexible work schedule. It’s a neighborhood store, and that’s the point: Beyond the question of soy sauce, what cutting back on Latino brands means in an area with a growing Latino population is that this supermarket is failing to reflect its neighborhood, which makes my mom —  and me —  worry that it may be failing to serve those neighbors. Where do you shop for food? Does your grocery store help you feel connected to your neighborhood? Do you prioritize convenience or cost? Foods that fit your culture or lifestyle? When a supermarket opens up in a food desert, how should it work to serve the existing community? We’d like to hear your thoughts at hello@theatlantic. com. Alana Semuels wrote a popular piece last month called “The Racist History of Portland, the Whitest City in America. ” Towards the end of it, she writes: Yet as the city became more progressive and “weird,” full of artists and techies and bikers, it did not have a conversation about its racist past. It still tends not to, even as gentrification and displacement continue in Albina and other neighborhoods. “If you were living here and you decided you wanted to have a conversation about race, you’d get the shock of your life,” Ed Washington, the longtime Portland resident, told me. “Because people in Oregon just don’t like to talk about it. ” Scores of Atlantic readers in Portland have been talking about Alana’s piece and emailing their views, so we’ve decided to convene a conversation about race in the city (via hello@theatlantic. com). To start things off, we’re focusing on Albina, the northeast area of Portland that historically housed the vast majority of the city’s African American residents. Albina now comprises the neighborhoods of Eliot, Boise, Humboldt, Irvington, King, Overlook, and Piedmont, plotted on this map: Here’s how Alana introduces Albina in her piece: As the city becomes more popular and   prices rise, it is Portland’s tiny African American population [6. 3 percent] that is being displaced to the   fringes of the city, leading to even less diversity in the city’s center. There are around 38, 000 African Americans in the city in Portland, according to Lisa K. Bates of Portland State University in recent years, 10, 000 of those 38, 000 have had to move from the center city to its fringes because of rising prices. The gentrification of the historically black neighborhood in central Portland, Albina, has led to conflicts between white Portlanders and   black residents over things like widening bicycle lanes and the construction of a new Trader Joe’s. Rosa Inocencio Smith, our new assistant editor for Notes (and writer of our Daily newsletter) will be posting a note soon about that Trader Joe’s controversy. Her hometown is Portland, so she will have a lot of great insight to share during our ongoing reader discussion. For my part, Portland has become an adopted hometown since my family moved there more than a decade ago, next to Albina, so I’m especially interested in this topic as well. But for a much closer firsthand perspective, here’s one of many readers who grew up in Albina: I lived in this neighborhood in the late ’80s. I still do. The first thing this article (and Kamau Bell’s CNN show [United Shades of America —  relevant clip here]) gets wrong is that this was a “black” neighborhood. Even when it was the center of black culture in Portland, it was still 40 percent white. Here’s a breakdown of that demographic over the decades: Back to our reader: The second thing is that blacks some how have a “historical claim” to Albina because they as a majority occupied it from roughly  . Hell, you could make the claim that neighboring Overlook is a “Polish” neighborhood if you want to go back far enough, and that the city should implement policies to promote Polish ownership, but nobody ever does. The third thing is over just how much safer (though in some respects less fun) this neighborhood is now. I too have had suspects pursued through my backyard, blocks cordoned off, gun fights in front of the house, I had to dive behind a car because of a   [reported examples here and here] been witness to and a victim of arson, and I can attest to this sad fact: More white people = less crime of all varieties, from littering to murder. As a homeowner here, amen to that. That “sad fact” seems very dubious. Gun crimes, for one, are dispersed throughout Portland, not just the Albina area: Residential burglary is similarly dispersed, while street robbery and   assaults are mostly concentrated downtown, across the river from Albina. Overall, according to an April 2015 news report that featured the crime statistics cited above, crime in Portland has “plummeted since the 1990s,” much like the rest of the country: Portland State Professor Kris Henning said many residents don’t realize that crime has declined considerably over the past 20 years. Henning said they devour so much crime news they think the city is more dangerous than it is. “Of the 13 crimes we looked at, the only one that increased significantly was bike theft,” [PSU student Kelsey] Baleilevuka said. Overall,   crimes in Portland have dropped 84%. Residential burglaries are down 61% motor vehicle thefts dropped 70% home robberies are down 76% and street robberies are down 70%.   …     Excluding homicides, crimes involving guns have moved from inner Northeast Portland toward Gresham. Another reader who lived in Albina makes a distinction between renters and homeowners in the neighborhood: Per the claim that 10, 000 African Americans were “forced out” of inner   I lived in the neighborhood starting in the late ’80s. Yes, it was   dangerous, and full of abandoned houses. Yes, I witnessed quite a few  . But many of my neighbors who were black and owned their homes were ready and willing, as prices increased throughout the ’90s, to sell out and move without being forced out. If you are a renter who can’t afford the rising rents, then you are forced to move. And this has happened to quite a few of my renting friends who have lived in the neighborhood for over 20 years, and yes, they are white. This next reader also attests to the crime in Albina in the ’80s, and the exodus of both black and white neighbors as development and higher prices arrived: It’s weird to read an Atlantic article about something I personally experienced. It’s a bit of a trip down memory lane. I’m white, and my parents moved to the Albina area in the late ’80s. They purchased and refurbished a 1920s bungalow as part of an urban renewal program. This made them the tip of the spear for gentrification, and the breakup of a historically black neighborhood. Like all people who kick off gentrification, they soon complained bitterly about the later newcomers who shoved property prices into the stratosphere. We moved from the area before I hit middle school, but I can confirm many of the points in the article. Rentals proliferated through the neighborhood. The area was still rough when we lived there. Police presence was constant, and it wasn’t until we moved that I realized constant police presence isn’t a thing in all neighborhoods. Once in a blue moon there were gunshots at night. My parents gave me lectures about not picking up trash and avoiding the used needles that littered public spaces. I vividly remember an incident when the police sealed off our entire block and ended up pursuing a fleeing man directly through our backyard. But there was definitely a community there. It was a mix of black and   white people who seemed to get along in a    sense. I often wonder what became of our old neighbors. Several adjacent properties were owned by black people who seemed to be just holding steady. With property prices in that area increasing about 10x since then, I wonder if they could even afford the taxes for their places if they stayed. Honestly, though, I don’t know if the breakup of the Albina black enclaves in Portland could have been prevented in any way. Portland in general is increasingly hostile to native populations from a financial standpoint. It’s overrun with wealthy tech money that dwarfs what used to be there. I recently visited part of my old neighborhood, and it’s a romping ground for Audis, Teslas, and people who buy $200 bottles of wine for dinner. Myself and my extended family were long ago shoved out into the suburbs. Race aside, nobody with a “normal” job can afford to buy property in many locations mentioned in the article. I don’t know exactly what people think could have been done to “preserve” the neighborhood, other than making some sort of bizarre   law that only allowed people of a certain race to live there. The real problem in Portland for   people of all colors is a lack of affordable housing. And the city’s response to that has been typically bureaucratic and inept. Here’s one more reader emphasizing class: I lived in Portland in the 1970s and have a child who lives there now. Urban renewal was not motivated by race it was motivated by money. If you lived in a cute or interesting neighborhood and someone with more money came along and wanted to live there too, they got to stay and you had to go. I had to leave Portland because I did not have the money or the job to stay. I had lived there for four years. The first year I lived within six blocks of the medical school, but by my last year of living in “Portland,” I lived in Tigard. I could have either lived in Tigard or I could have lived in Gresham. I was not pushed out of the downtown area because of my race I was pushed out because of money. If you have also lived in Albina and want to provide any contrasting views and experiences, please drop us a note. *** One question that arises from Alana’s article: Does gentrification ever increase opportunity for poor residents? Definitely, according to Lance Freeman, the director of the Urban Planning program at Columbia. In an email he sent me last summer for a piece on gentrification, Freeman described some of the upsides: Gentrification brings new amenities and services that benefit not only the newcomers but long term residents too.   supermarkets that carry fresh produce, restaurants where residents could dine in, and   parks are often lacking in poor neighborhoods prior to gentrification. For   residents who are able to stay, either due to housing subsidies, owning their home, or their own earning capacity improving, these changes are often appreciated. And most residents are able to stay, at least according to a 2004 study that Freeman conducted with economist Frank Braconi they found that   African Americans in New York City were more likely to remain in gentrifying neighborhoods than stagnant ones. They noted similar findings in Boston. And here’s how my colleague Yoni Appelbaum, in a post by   Coates, summarized another study, from the University of  : “In plain English, they’re arguing that gentrification isn’t forcing people out it’s bringing in yuppies and hipsters, and hanging on to   minority households that would otherwise have decamped for the suburbs. ” In the case of Portland, whose black residents were historically confined to one area, wouldn’t the displacement of many Albina renters out to “The Numbers” —  the city’s   outer neighborhoods, which are historically white —  have, at minimum, a silver lining of more racial integration? And   African Americans who own their homes in Albina are likely to remain, thus blending with the   newcomers of all backgrounds. (More than 26 percent of Portland residents are not classified “white” or “black. ”) That sort of gentrification —  black neighborhoods becoming more white and white neighborhoods becoming more black, with at least more investment in Albina, if not The Numbers —  seems like the least bad outcome. The risk, in my mind, is if the movement of people and money occurs too quickly, without reasonable measures in place to mitigate mass displacement (e. g. rent control,   housing, Section 8 vouchers). A 2015 report by Governing magazine determined that Portland is, in fact, the   city in the U. S. —  something that should give everyone pause. Do you have any strong views about gentrification, especially as it relates to Portland? Let us know. *** For continued reading on Albina, a reader recommends a history published in 1993 by the Portland Bureau of Planning: As someone who lived in Portland for years, and now lives elsewhere in Oregon, I was glad to read the article by Alana Semuels. One book I would recommend to anyone who wants to read about this history at greater length would be Portland’s Albina Community, available online from Multnomah County.  Despite the provenance, it’s unvarnished. It dates from the ’90s, though, before gentrification, when Albina was still   black and had a different set of problems. Another reader points to a much older chapter in Portland’s history: I’ve been an Oregonian my whole life, and can attest to Semuels’s article. I’ve been doing some work on local history, and something that may be worth bringing up is the foundation of the Portland Police, largely by James H. Lappeus. Lappeus was a former soldier that, after the   War, helped form other veterans in 1849 into the Hounds. To quote a 1920 article by Rockwell Hunt, “In short, the Hounds were a band of desperadoes, or public robbers, who committed repeated aggressions and offenses upon the people of San Francisco under the flimsy pretense of opposition to foreigners, given colors by General Persifer Smith’s declared intention of driving off all foreigners. The gang paralyzed the town with terror. ” Hunt gives too much credit to the Committee of Vigilance that expelled the Hounds, but several of the Hounds —  Lappeus included —  went to Portland. Lappeus, as noted, started the Portland Police. The distant infrastructure in a relatively unpopulated part of the nation ended up continuing to be a    infrastructure with more than a little splash of white criminal activity (see [crime boss] Jim Elkins, for instance). The perception that the police, and general infrastructure, in Portland is racist is a historic fact. The only way to really change it is to recognize and address it. There has been movement to that direction, but it has —  and will be —  slow going.         For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.

{"article": "  Americans who voted for Donald J. Trump continue to approve of him as president, even though he supported a health care bill that would disproportionately hurt them. Highly educated professionals tend to lean Democratic, even though Republican tax policies would probably leave more money in their pockets. Why do people vote against their economic interests? The answer, experts say, is partisanship. Party affiliation has become an   identity that outweighs the details of specific policies. “Partisan identification is bigger than anything the party does,” said Frances Lee, a professor at the University of Maryland who wrote a book on partisan polarization. Rather, it stems from something much more fundamental: people’s idea of who they are. For American voters, party affiliation is a way to express a bundle of identities. “It more or less boils down to how you see the conflicts in American society, and which groups you see as representing you,” Ms. Lee said. “That often means race, and religion, and ethnicity  —   those are the social groups that underlie party identification. ” That process is not necessarily conscious. “There’s sort of an embarrassment about being a partisan,” Ms. Lee said. “It’s seen as admitting to a bias. ” That often leads people to say that they are independent, she said, but in fact most voters consistently lean toward one of the parties. As partisanship grows, switching parties has become rare for voters. So has   in which voters support different parties in presidential and   races. But when people do switch, it is often because they feel that the other party has become a better representative of the groups that they identify with. Preliminary data suggests that is what happened with the Democratic voters who voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, said Lilliana Mason, a professor at the University of Maryland who studies partisanship. “Older voters who scored high on racial resentment were much more likely to switch from Obama to Trump,” Ms. Mason said. She believes that he successfully made a pitch to what she calls “white male identity politics,” convincing older,   white voters that he would represent their interests. Economic status, it turns out, is not so important in partisanship. “Class in American politics, rich vs. poor, is just not a very good predictor of party identification,” Ms. Lee said. For both rich and poor Americans, other identities take precedence. “There are plenty of rich Democrats,” Ms. Lee pointed out. “There are plenty of Republican politicians who represent poor districts. ” That’s not to say that the parties don’t have major differences on economic matters. But, experts say, those differences matter more to elites than to    voters. That is why, for instance, Mr. Trump was able to win the G. O. P. nomination even though he broke with Republican ideology on economic matters like trade protectionism. His arguments played to white   voter identity, and that turned out to be a successful strategy even though it alienated many of the party’s leaders. But how voters choose their party is only one element of the story. The overlapping identities that underlie partisanship are also driving a form of polarization so strong that it is now essentially impossible for politicians, or the public, to avoid its influence. In 2009, when Ms. Mason was still a graduate student, she had a “eureka” moment about American politics. “I stumbled across this social psychology article from 2002 that talked about what happens when multiple identities line up together,” she said in an interview. “There was all this social psychology literature about how it increases bias. ” The same, she realized, was true of partisan identity. Everyone has multiple identities: racial, religious, professional, ideological and more. But while those multiple identities might once have pushed people in different partisan directions  —   think of the conservative Democrats of old in the South or all the liberal Republicans in the Northeast  —   today it’s more common to line up behind one party. A white conservative who lives in a rural area and is an evangelical Christian is likely to feel that the Republican Party is the best representative of all of those separate identities, for instance. An   liberal who lives in a city and works in a professional job is likely to feel the same way about the Democratic Party. Can this explain why American politics have become so polarized over the last several decades? Starting in 1980, the National Election Study, a   survey that tracks Americans’ political preferences, showed that Republicans and Democrats were growing apart: Each reported increasingly negative opinions of the opposing party. And other data showed that polarization was seeping into nonpolitical arenas, making Republicans and Democrats less likely to marry or be friends. Ms. Mason decided to make that the focus of her doctoral thesis, and found much to support her hypothesis: Americans’ overlapping political identities were driving extreme polarization. When multiple identities line up together, all pushing people toward the same party, partisan identity becomes a kind of umbrella for many different characteristics that people feel are important to them. That magnifies people’s attachment to their team. And that, in turn, raises the stakes of conflict with the opposing “team,” Ms. Mason found. In every electoral contest or partisan disagreement, she explained, people now feel that they are fighting for many elements of who they are: their racial identity, professional identity, religious identity, even geographical identity. “The way I think of it is, imagine that the World Series also affected the N. C. A. A. and the Super Bowl and every other team you care about,” she said. “So as our identities line up with party identity, politics becomes more and more consequential. ” That may have been the key to Mr. Trump’s success in the 2016 election, she believes. “With Trump, if you can point to one brilliant thing he did, it’s that he as a politician, kind of for the first time, said ‘we’re losers.’ ” Social psychology research has shown that the best way to get people to defend their identity is to threaten it. By saying “we don’t win anymore  —   we’re losers  —   and I’m going to make us win again,” Ms. Mason said, Mr. Trump’s pitch to voters both created the sense of threat and promised a defense: a winning political strategy for the age of identity politics. The result of those overlapping, powerful identities is that Americans have become more willing to defend their party against any perceived threat, and to demand that their politicians take uncompromisingly partisan stands. But while those demands can affect policy, they are rooted in emotional attachments, not policy goals. “When we talk about being a sports fan, there’s no policy content related to that,” Ms. Mason said. “It’s just this sense of connection. And that’s powerful! It makes people cry. It makes people riot. There doesn’t really have to be any policy content for people to get riled up, and to be extremely committed. ” Ms. Mason, along with Leonie Huddy, a professor at Stony Brook University, and Lene Aaroe of Aarhus University in Denmark, conducted an experiment to test the importance of policy. They found that people responded much more strongly to threats or support to their party than to particular issues. They became angry at perceived threats to their party, and enthusiastic about its perceived successes. Their responses to policy gains and losses, by contrast, were much more muted. That helps explain why Mr. Trump’s support among Republican voters remains quite high, even though the first few months of his presidency have been plagued by scandals and political setbacks, and even though his overall national approval ratings are now very low. He has been careful to recast every potential scandal and policy struggle as a battle against the Democrats and other outside groups. Mr. Trump has insisted, for instance, that the F. B. I. investigation into his campaign staffers’ contacts with Russia is meaningless “fake news,” and that the real issue is whether President Obama wiretapped him before the election. (There is no evidence thus far that any such wiretapping took place.) And when the Republican health care bill failed despite Mr. Trump’s support, he at first blamed Democrats. Republican voters may not be happy with everything the president does  —   many, for instance, have told reporters that they would prefer him to tweet less often, and others worry about how his health care plans will affect their families  —   but he is still the captain of their “team. ” Abandoning him would mean betraying tribal allegiance, and all of the identities that underlie it.", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> Americans who voted for Donald J.

But in the meantime he’s borrowed from the banks, he’s personally guaranteed, and he didn’t put them on his personal financial disclosure form, which is a tremendous sin,” Trump said, inaccurately describing the forms the loans were omitted from. “I mean, that’s a horrible thing he did. And he didn’t disclose all of this information. ” According to the The New York Times, which first reported the omission of the loans last week, Cruz did report the loans in personal financial disclosures filed with the Senate, but did not report them as a source of income for his Senate campaign. Cruz has called the failure to disclose the loans a “technical and inadvertent filing error. ” In the interview on The Howie Carr Show, Trump reiterated his case that Cruz, who was born in Canada, should seek to clarify that he is eligible for the presidency, saying “He’s got to go to court to take out the doubt, Howie. ” And at various points in the conversation the real estate magnate set his sights on Jeb Bush, panning him for his campaign expenditures, calling him a “child,” and saying “he’s ashamed to use the last name Bush. ” “He should give it to the Wounded Warriors and stop wasting his money,” Trump said. “And much of it was spent on negative ads on me and then he wonders why I treat him badly. But he’s a child. He’s a child. And this is the problem. We can’t have people like this running our country. China would walk all over Jeb Bush. ISIS would walk all over Jeb Bush. ” Trump added later, “He’s like a child, he’s like a child. And he ought to try using his last name. He’s not even proud of his last name. He says Jeb. And he oughta use his last name. ” Trump also appeared to defend South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, who criticized the former reality TV star in her rebuttal to President Obama’s State of the Union address, calling on Americans to “resist the siren call of the angriest voices,” a comment that led Trump supporters and Trump himself to hit back at her, saying she is “weak” on immigration. But on Wednesday, Trump, who called himself an “angry person” who is “very happy in my life, but I’m very angry about the way our country is being run,” said Haley said she understood his anger. “She understood it and she actually, you know, came out and said, I fully understand it,” Trump said. “I’ve been a supporter of hers and she understood that I’m angry, but it’s not just me. I just filled up an arena in Oklahoma. ”  ", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> “He’s trying to be like he’s Robin Hood and the banks, he’s gonna get the banks.

{"article": "   Philip K. Howard is chair of the group Common Good and author of “The Rule of Nobody. ”             On Fox News on Sunday,   Donald Trump lamented that those seeking government permits sometimes “are waiting in line for 15 years,” sometimes only to get rejected in the end, and vowed to speed up the process. To succeed, he’ll need a new approach to governing. Every president since Jimmy Carter has vowed to cut unnecessary regulations, but the   machine has defied all attempts at control.  Trump’s idea is to institute a “   ” rule  —   that for every new regulation, two must be removed. Britain instituted a similar protocol in 2010 to cull unnecessary regulation and recently expanded it to “one in, three out. ” This is part of a broader British effort to control regulatory creep, and it has achieved modest success. Imposing similar discipline on new U. S. regulations is long overdue. For the past 50 years, Washington’s approach has been like the Roach Motel  —   regulations check in, but they never check out. But incremental reform is not enough.    reformers have failed because they assume the problem is a matter of degree  —   that there are just too many rules. Liberals stride into the   jungle with pruning shears, and find themselves entangled in the internal logic of the rules. Conservatives get cheers for demanding deregulation, but when push comes to shove, voters don’t want to drink polluted water, eat spoiled food or entrust loved ones to the unsupervised care of strangers in   centers and nursing homes. That’s why the regulatory state grew, not shrank, in the 20 years of Reagan and two Bush presidencies.  What reformers have missed is that regulatory failure is not merely a matter of too much regulation but is caused by a flawed philosophy on how to regulate. Both sides assume that human responsibility should be replaced by what is called “clear law. ” By striving to prescribe every possible good choice, and proscribe every possible evil, U. S. regulation became an obsessive exercise in micromanagement. That’s why rulebooks are often 1, 000 pages, while the Constitution is 15. The evil to be exorcised by all these legal dictates is human authority. Only by lashing each other tightly with detailed law can liberal and conservative politicians be sure that the other side won’t do something bad. But ordinary citizens in our free society are also lashed to these mindless dictates  —   complying with rules that often make no difference, filling out forms no one reads and stymied by bureaucrats whose response to every idiocy is always “The rule made me do it. ” In the name of better freedom, detailed regulations have made everyone powerless. The solution  —   the only solution  —   is to retool regulation to focus on results, not inputs. Find any good school, any good agency, and you will find people who take responsibility for getting the job done. Experts at the Federal Aviation Administration certify planes as “airworthy” based on their expert judgment, not compliance with detailed specs on, say, how many rivets per square foot. Teachers at good schools typically say that the principal encourages them to do what they think is best and not worry about complying with many forms and metrics. The activating mechanism for every public choice must be human responsibility. What’s good is what works. Yes, it’s a good idea to review environmental impacts, but it’s idiotic to spend a decade creating   tomes that double the cost of projects and cause environmental harm by prolonging polluting bottlenecks.  The opportunity here is to move from paralysis to practicality. Focusing on results, with clear lines of authority and accountability, is a   strategy: Regulation is more effective, and less costly, when regulators and citizens are not preoccupied with compliance. Australia replaced dense nursing home regulation with 31 general principles  —   for example, to provide “a   setting. ” Within a short period, nursing homes across Australia markedly improved because, studies showed, the caregivers felt free to focus on what residents needed instead of trudging through the day with their noses in a rulebook.  Regulation by results would radically simplify law  —   in some areas, more like “   . ” Hundreds of federal safety specifications for factory equipment could be encompassed within one general principle: “Tools and equipment shall be reasonably suited for the use intended, in accordance with industry standards. ” Is there room for disagreement? Yes, but only at the margins. Instead of wasting regulatory resources on foot faults that don’t matter, the safety agency could redeploy its resources to finding workplaces that are actually unsafe. Specificity would still be needed for, say, pollution discharge limits, but the litmus test should be whatever achieves the desired results. Rebuilding the federal behemoth is an ambitious goal, fraught with perceived peril as well as opportunity. But do we have a choice? No one serious defends the inefficiencies in the current system. Americans are tired of being pushed around by headless bureaucracy.   by the past six presidents have all failed. The upside here is transformational. Virtually every federal program is broken, with the only open question how much. Should   compliance costs drive small banks into the arms of larger banks? Should safety laws prohibit children from normal play activities? All these stupidities can be cured, but only if people with responsibility are given the freedom to use common sense. Giving permits for infrastructure in two years, not 10, would add 1. 5 million jobs and create a greener footprint.  The downside is low. Rigid bureaucracy prevents officials and citizens alike from adapting to rapid changes in global forces. Regulation by results doesn’t guarantee success, but it gives us the freedom to try.

{"article": "With the media frantically hiding the content of Donald Trump’s terrorism speech from last week, he should respond to every question with the central point of that speech: How does this kind of immigration make our country better? How does it make the country safer? [Media: Show us your tax returns!  Trump: Show me how our immigration policies are good for the people who already live here. Media: Tell us why you fired Corey Lewandowski! Trump: Tell me how our immigration policies are making the country safer for the people who already live here. Media: How are you going to match Hillary’s corporate fundraising? Trump: How are our immigration policies helping the people who already live here? Sooner or later people will say, “That’s a good question  —   why is this necessary?” When the Third World immigrants admitted under Sen. Teddy Kennedy’s 1965 Immigration Act  —   as well as their children  —   commit mass murder, the government and media tell us it’s a gun problem. Or it’s “our” culture. Or it’s “homophobia. ” Or we have to keep admitting millions of Muslims because otherwise the ones already here will REALLY hate us. Isn’t that extortion? We’ve already admitted millions of Muslim immigrants, but if we don’t take in millions more, the ones we’ve admitted will go on killing sprees? How did we get in the position where we’re screwed if we’re not in the good graces of the Muslim community? Maybe we should stop doing that. As any competent health professional will tell you, prevention is always better than a cure. No one says, Go ahead and have sex with that syphilitic whore  —   we’ve got a cure! You don’t need to worry about a leaky roof  —   we’ve got mops! They know that’s not a good argument, which is why the media refuse to tell you what Trump actually said in his terrorism speech. Like defendants with a losing case being forced to cough up bits of discovery, it took the FBI a week to release a redacted transcript of the Orlando shooter’s 911 call pledging allegiance to ISIS. Even then, the first version came from George Orwell’s Ministry of Truth: “I pledge allegiance to (omitted) may God protect him (in Arabic) on behalf of (omitted). ” That was too much even for Speaker Paul “That’s Not Who We Are” Ryan, prompting the FBI to produce the full version of at least one of Omar’s calls. (It turns out, he wasn’t pledging allegiance to Wayne LaPierre or Phyllis Schlafly.) To hide the epidemic of immigrant mass murders, all the lists have to include massacres from a time when there weren’t many immigrants here  —   before Kennedy’s Immigration Act had fully kicked in and overwhelmed our country with the Third World. Fox News ran a chart compiled by Mother Jones magazine that includes mass shootings from the 1980s. Why not the 1960s? Why not include Bonnie and Clyde? Could we look at mass murders from the last decade? Those include: 2016: Orlando, Florida,   Afghan immigrant Omar Mateen  —   49 dead, 2015: San Bernardino, California,   and   Pakistani immigrants Tashfeen Malik and Syed Farook  —   14 dead, 2015: Chattanooga, Tennessee, Kuwaiti immigrant Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez  —   5 dead, 2014: Isla Vista, California,   immigrant from England, Elliot Rodger  —   6 dead, 2013: The Boston Marathon, Chechen immigrants Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev  —   4 dead, 2009: Fort Hood, Texas, Palestinian   immigrant Nidal Hasan  —   13 dead, 2009: Binghamton, New York, Vietnamese immigrant Jiverly Wong  —   13 dead, 2007: Virginia Tech, South Korean immigrant   Cho  —   32 dead. In the same time period, about a   mass murders were committed by American white men in their own country, where  —   despite Teddy Kennedy’s best efforts  —   they far outnumber Vietnamese, Pakistanis and Afghans. All the American shooters were visible nut cases, who never should have been let out of a  . Their psychotic episodes wouldn’t even count as mass shootings if committed by immigrants. Pakistani Naveed Haq’s 2006 mass shooting at the Seattle Jewish Federation, for example, isn’t generally included on lists of terrorist attacks because, according to his parents, he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was on lithium. Why do we need this? How are our current immigration policies helping the people who already live here? How are they making our country better, stronger, safer? The operation to remake our country began with lies and has been sustained with lies ever since. Teddy Kennedy swore up and down that his 1965 Immigration Act would preserve America’s traditional “ethnic mix” and would not “inundate” our country with people from “deprived nations. ” In fact, his law brought in the poorest of the poor, from the most dysfunctional cultures in the world, and effected the most dramatic demographic transformation of any nation in all of human history. But today, you’re Hitler if you support Teddy Kennedy’s original claims about his own bill.

{"article": " (CNN) The only man charged in the 2010 disappearance and death of honor student Phylicia Barnes has been freed by a judge in Baltimore.

Russell Barnes, Phylicia Barnes’ father, said the ruling was heartbreaking. ”I feel like I got run over by a train,” he said. The body of the    Barnes was found floating in a Maryland river in spring 2011. Authorities said she was found without clothes and with no ”overt” signs of wounds or injuries.

About a year after her body was found, police arrested Johnson, the  ’s  .  Johnson was convicted of second degree murder in January 2013. But his attorneys successfully argued that he should have a new trial because the prosecution withheld evidence about a witness who linked Johnson to the killing, according to the judge’s order that summarized the case. Last month, the second trial ended in a mistrial because the jury was allowed to hear information in recordings that should have been redacted, the court order stated.  Defense lawyers filed a motion for acquittal. The judge’s order said there was plenty of circumstantial evidence against Johnson, including that he was the last person known to see Barnes and that a witness watched him sweating as he carried an object in a tote down the apartment stairs on the day she disappeared.  However, the judge wrote, ”there was insufficient evidence when taken as a whole” to convict Johnson on a charge of   murder.  Prosecutors tweeted a statement saying they disagree with the judge’s decision and will appeal the ruling. Defense lawyer Kay Beehler issued a statement saying, ”This case was a tragedy for everyone in the Barnes and Johnson families. Ms. Barnes was a lovely, vibrant young woman.  However, Mr. Johnson has maintained his innocence from Day One of this entire case, and we are very thankful that justice was done. ” Johnson left jail and was met by reporters on the street. ”It feels great to be out,” he said. Russell Barnes said he’ll keep working to put Johnson behind bars. ”We just can’t let this go,” he said. ”We have to see justice for Phylicia. We’re just going to pursue . .. the same gentlemen, a child killer who’s on the streets of Baltimore.”", "sentence": {"content": "<div> (CNN) The only man charged in the 2010 disappearance and death of honor student Phylicia Barnes has been freed by a judge in Baltimore.

{"article": " With Bernie Sanders now leading in both Iowa and New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton’s been trying to blunt his economic populist appeal by showing that she, too, is serious about taxing rich people. First she proposed a new 4 percent surcharge on all income above $5 million (including capital gains and investment income) and now she’s proposing a hike in the estate tax. Clinton would increase the maximum rate to 45 percent from the current maximum of 40, and decrease the lifetime exemption from estate and gift taxes to $3. 5 million from $5. 45 million.    But it’s important to put this proposal in context. Not only does the 45 percent figure pale in comparison to Sanders’s proposed 65 percent top rate, but a 45 percent top rate is actually quite low by historical standards. The current 40 percent rate, and the 35 percent rate that preceded it, are the lowest since 1932. The rate peaked at 77 percent, and stayed there from 1940 to 1976. When President Clinton left office, it was 55 percent. It was only after the Bush tax cuts ratcheted the tax back, ultimately eliminating them in 2010, that President Obama and   Minority Leader Mitch McConnell reached a deal to retroactively bring the tax back at 35 percent for that year. The 2012 tax deal raised the rate again to 40 percent, where it’s been ever since:              The $3. 5 million exemption is also very high by historical standards:              In fairness, Sanders’s plan is more tepid than it initially appears. The 65 percent rate only applies to estates worth $1 billion or more. His exemption would also be $3. 5 million for individuals, just like Clinton’s. They’d even share the 45 percent rate for estates between $3. 5 million and $10 million; Sanders adds a 50 percent bracket for estates between $10 million and $50 million, and then a 55 percent bracket for estates larger than that, plus a 10 percent surtax for billionaires (hence the 65 percent figure). It’s a significantly bigger tax hike than Clinton’s, but it still doesn’t get the estate tax back up to its 1999 or 2000 levels.    Clinton and Sanders are also both declining to pursue more fundamental reforms to the   ”death tax.” A number of tax analysts, notably NYU Law’s Lily Batchelder, have proposed moving to an inheritance tax, where the living beneficiaries of an estate, rather than the deceased person’s estate itself, would include inheritance money in their taxable income and perhaps pay an additional surtax on it. This ensures that the most affluent inheritors pay the most, and giving each beneficiary a lifetime exclusion of $1 million to $2 million would encourage estates to distribute to more people, breaking themselves up into smaller pieces and more effectively combating entrenched dynamic wealth than the current tax. Inheritance taxation also has a political benefit, in that it would mean the government is not technically taxing dead people.

Not only does the 45 percent figure pale in comparison to Sanders’s proposed 65 percent top rate, but a 45 percent top rate is actually quite low by historical standards. The current 40 percent rate, and the 35 percent rate that preceded it, are the lowest since 1932. The rate peaked at 77 percent, and stayed there from 1940 to 1976.

In this installment, we will consider positive precedents for a new president’s domestic policy. [Next in a series,    1.  The Democrats’ Struggle to Remember Their Roots  For the Forgotten Man, and the Forgotten Woman, it’s nice to be remembered.  During the campaign, Donald Trump revived the phrase, “Forgotten Man,” which echoes back to the Depression years of the 1930s. Specifically, it harkens to Franklin D. Roosevelt, the great   champion of   Americans. As FDR said during the 1932 presidential campaign, while challenging incumbent Herbert Hoover —  who had presided over an   increase in unemployment during his single miserable term —  the crisis of the age was akin to 1917, when the US was forced to enter World War One: These unhappy times call for the building of plans that rest upon the forgotten, the unorganized but indispensable units of economic power for plans like those of 1917 that build from the bottom up and not from the top down, that put their faith once more in the forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid.  [emphasis added] The American people appreciated FDR’s sense of urgency, which stood in stark contrast with Hoover’s        .  So in November 1932, FDR won a massive victory, carrying 42 of 48 states.  Thus we can see: The Forgotten People didn’t like being forgotten, and they were grateful to the candidate who cared about them.  Eight decades later, we were reminded of this same point: During the campaign, Donald Trump had plenty to say about the economy, and his message most hit home in the forgotten areas of the country.  For example, on October 21, in   Johnstown, PA, Trump said: Your government betrayed you, and I’m going to make it right.  Your jobs will come back under a Trump administration.  Your steel will come back. We’re putting your miners back to work.  In addition, Trump was respectful to, and attentive of, the industrial heritage of the region:  The iron and steel forged in your mills formed the backbone of our nation.  . . . This was the town that people flocked to from around the world to make their American Dreams come true. And so on Election Night, the victorious Trump, having Pennsylvania and other afflicted states, emphatically revived the Rooseveltian trope of yore, proclaiming, “The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. ” Remember my forgotten manYou put a rifle in his handYou sent him far awayYou shouted: “ ! ”But look at him today, Yes, it’s sad that the folks who have played by the rules, paid their taxes, and fought in the wars were forgotten —  as the forces of globalism, mostly cheered by the elites of both parties —  took their terrible toll. Then came Trump.   As we all know, he talked a different language, with a different set of issues, than the other 16 Republicans in the presidential race —  and he was richly rewarded.  And then came Trump vs. Clinton.    Hillary, Obama’s anointed successor, ran a campaign that could only be described as snobbish, curiously hostile to “deplorable” Middle America.  In the tart words of liberal novelist Mark Lilla, she thought she could win by ignoring America as a whole, and instead   favored blocs:  She tended on the campaign trail to lose that large vision and slip into the rhetoric of diversity, calling out explicitly to   Latino, LGBT and women voters at every stop. This was a strategic mistake.  If you are going to mention groups in America, you had better mention all of them.  If you don’t, those left out will notice and feel excluded.  Which, as the data show, was exactly what happened with the white working class and those with strong religious convictions.  Fully   of white voters without college degrees voted for Donald Trump, as did over 80 percent of white evangelicals. Indeed, the whole 2016 election can be seen as a battle between   insiders and   outsiders.  In the   words of Peggy Noonan, the voting was reflective of the distinction between the “protected” and the “unprotected”:  The unprotected people of America, who have to live with Washington’s policies, rebelled against the protected, who make and defend those policies and who care little if at all about the unprotected.  That broke bonds of loyalty and allegiance.  Tuesday was in effect an uprising of the unprotected.  It was part of the   against detached elites that is sweeping the West and was seen most recently in the Brexit vote. Hence the November 18 headline in Politico: “House Democrats lament     Some fear that the party’s move toward urban and suburban voters will eventually shut Democrats out of former white   strongholds. ”  In the words of Rep. Collin Peterson ( .) an increasingly lonely rural Democrat, “We’ve become an urban party. ” Indeed, for Democrats, a grimmer, and more realistic, mood seems to be settling in about not only geography, but also, ideology.  Thus this November 20 headline, also in Politico: “How the Left Created Trump: Nov. 8 represented an explosion of anger on the right at years of smugness and disdain by liberals. ”  In the words of writer Rob Hoffman:  As a bemused aside: Wasn’t it just yesterday that the Democrats, and their handmaidens in the MSM, were telling Republicans that they were doomed if they didn’t embrace multiculturalism and “comprehensive immigration reform”?  Yet as always, as James Carville famously said, “It’s the economy, stupid. ”  And so where were the Democrats on that issue?  Here’s where they were this year: busy dreaming up schemes to decrease growth.

{"article": "In the wake of the seemingly endless terror attacks by migrants and Muslims in France and Germany, Breitbart London    Raheem Kassam has slammed open border activists. [Mr. Kassam confirmed he has “exactly” been warning that “following the mistakes of Europe will result in an American catastrophe and people will die” when presenter Sean Hannity asked him about his stance on his radio show.  “That is what I said about what’s happened in Germany, and we warned about it last year we warned about it in Belgium we’ve warned about it in France, and it is coming to fruition,” he said. “Let me tell you something: it’s very hard to fight for social justice if you’re dead,” Mr. Kassam added, slamming powerful liberal open borders activists such as George Soros who encouraged the “migrant crisis” from the Middle East.  “And the most galling element of it,” he continued, “is that we have the BBC, and the New York Times, and Sky News, and all of these other guys who are basically saying: ‘well, a backpack killed these people, a machete killed them’. “No. These are Syrian migrants who have faked being refugees. Some of them have been turned down in terms of asylum status, and they happen to have   knowledge and explosives at the same time? “I want to know how these people got into the country and how they weren’t screened out, when their asylum application failed, and immediately deported,” he said, asking: “Why was this man still in the country?” Some shocking allegations were also made on the show, pertaining to the possible Islamist infiltration of U. S. authorities. “I agree with [Richard Higgins] that there is an NGO presence that is deeply entrenched in the U. S. establishment,” said Mr. Kassam after Mr. Higgins claimed that America’s domestic   strategies and part of its foreign policy are influenced by the Muslim Brotherhood. Mr. Higgins is a former leader inside the Department of Defense who managed programmes at the Combating Terrorism and Technical Support Office (CTTSO) and Irregular Warfare Section, and was appearing alongside Mr. Kassam on the show. Mr. Hannity had asked why President Obama is insisting 10, 000 “refugees” from the Middle East are brought immediately to America, and why Democratic nominee Hilary Clinton advocates increasing numbers by “500 per cent”. “Why are they so willing to gamble with the lives of Americans considering this has now happened at least a dozen times?” he asked. “I think that they’re so keen to have them coming in here because their Muslim Brotherhood advisers are telling them that is best for the West,” said Mr. Higgins. “We see Muslim Brotherhood influence through NGO organisations as well as affiliated with United Nations elements on the ground in Syria [and] on the front end of the vetting process in Syria  —   which is why you see 99 per cent of the people coming out are actually Muslims, not the Christians, not the ones being most persecuted,” he said. “They’re on the back end here in the United States, coordinating their reception  …     once they arrive both in Europe and then here in the United States,” he added.", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> In the wake of the seemingly endless terror attacks by migrants and Muslims in France and Germany, Breitbart London Raheem Kassam has slammed open border activists.

{"article": " The Arab world’s biggest powers cut ties with Qatar on Monday, accusing it of support for Islamist militants and Iran, and reopening a festering wound two weeks after U. S. President Donald Trump’s demand for Muslim states to fight terrorism. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain severed diplomatic relations with Qatar in a coordinated move. Yemen, Libya’s   government and the Maldives joined later. Transport links shut down, triggering supply shortages. Qatar, a small peninsular nation of 2. 5 million people that has a large U. S. military base, denounced the action as predicated on lies about it supporting militants. It has often been accused of being a funding source for Islamists, as has Saudi Arabia. Iran, long at odds with Saudi Arabia and a    target of the move, blamed Trump’s visit last month to Riyadh and called for the sides to overcome their differences. ”What is happening is the preliminary result of the sword dance,” tweeted Hamid Aboutalebi, deputy chief of staff to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, referring to Trump’s joining in a traditional dance with the Saudi king at the meeting. Closing all transport links with Qatar, the three Gulf states gave Qatari visitors and residents two weeks to leave, and Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt banned Qatari planes from  landing and forbade them from crossing their air space. Qatar’s stock market index sank 7. 3 percent, with some of the market’s top blue chips hardest hit, and some Egyptian banks said they were suspending dealing with Qatari banks. The UAE and Saudi Arabia stopped exports of white sugar to Qatar, a potential hit to consumers during the holy month of Ramadan, when demand is high. Some residents in Qatar began stockpiling food and supplies, an expatriate said. ”People have stormed into the supermarket hoarding food, especially imported ones. . .. It’s chaos   I’ve never seen anything like this before,” said Eva Tobaji, an expatriate resident in Doha, told Reuters after returning from shopping. Supply difficulties quickly developed. Two Middle East trade sources spoke of thousands of trucks carrying food stuck at the Saudi border, unable make the sole overland frontier crossing into Qatar. About 80 percent of Qatar’s food requirements are sourced via bigger Gulf Arab neighbors. Trade sources pointed to the likelihood of shortages growing in Qatar until the crisis eased.  Along with Egypt, however, the UAE and Saudi Arabia could be vulnerable to retaliation, being highly dependent on Qatar for liquefied natural gas. ’WORRISOME’ The hawkish tone on Tehran and on terrorism that Trump brought in his visit to Muslim leaders in Riyadh is seen as having laid the groundwork for the diplomatic crisis. ”You have a shift in the balance of power in the Gulf now because of the new presidency: Trump is strongly opposed to political Islam and Iran,” said   Rickli, head of global risk and resilience at the Geneva Centre for Security Policy. ”He is totally aligned with Abu Dhabi and Riyadh, who also want no compromise with either Iran or the political Islam promoted by the Muslim Brotherhood.” The United States called for a quick resolution of the dispute, and does not want to see a ”permanent rift,” a senior U. S. administration official said. ”There’s an acknowledgement that a lot of Qatari behavior is quite worrisome not just to our Gulf neighbors but to the U. S.,” the official said. ”We want to bring them in the right direction.” A State Department official said all U. S. partnerships with Gulf nations were vital and called on all parties to quickly resolve their differences. The U. S. military said it had seen no impact to its   operations, intended mainly as a bulwark against Iran, and added it was grateful for Qatar’s   support of a U. S. presence and commitment to regional security. The diplomatic   threatens the international prestige of Qatar, which is set to host the 2022 soccer World Cup. Soccer’s governing body, FIFA, said on Monday it was in ”regular contact” with Qatar’s 2022 organizing committee, but did not comment directly on the diplomatic situation.  MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD Qatar’s backing of Islamists dates to a decision by the current emir’s father to end a tradition of automatic deference to Saudi Arabia, the dominant Gulf Arab power, and forge the widest possible array of allies. Doha subsequently cultivated not only Islamists like America’s foes Iran, Hamas and the Taliban in pursuit of leverage, but also Washington itself, hosting the largest U. S. air base in the Middle East. Qatar has for years presented itself as a mediator and power broker for the region’s many disputes. But Egypt and the Gulf Arab states resent Qatar’s support for Islamists, especially the Muslim Brotherhood, which they see as a political enemy. Muslim Brotherhood groups allied to Doha are now mostly on retreat in the region, especially after a 2013 military takeover in Egypt ousted the elected Islamist president. The former army chief and now president, Abdel Fattah   along with Cairo’s allies in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, blacklist the Brotherhood as a terrorist organization. The Brotherhood says it supports only peaceful politics. Saudi Arabia accused Qatar on Monday of backing militant groups and broadcasting their ideology, an apparent reference to Qatar’s influential   satellite channel al Jazeera. Later in the day, the kingdom shut the Saudi bureau of al Jazeera. Al Jazeera says it is an independent news service giving a voice to everyone in the region. Riyadh also accused Qatar of supporting what it described as   militants in the restive, largely Shi’ite   eastern Saudi region of Qatif, as well as in Bahrain. Qatar denied it was interfering in the affairs of others. ”The campaign of incitement is based on lies that had reached the level of complete fabrications,” the Qatari foreign ministry said in a statement. Turkey also called for dialogue to settle the dispute and a government spokesman said President Tayyip Erdogan was working for a diplomatic solution to the rift. Sudan expressed its concern over the row and offered to mediate between all sides. FALLOUT A split between Doha and its closest allies could have  repercussions around the Middle East, where Gulf states have used their financial and political power to influence events in Libya, Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Yemen. The economic fallout was already hitting home as Abu Dhabi’s   Etihad Airways, Dubai’s Emirates Airline and budget carriers Flydubai and Air Arabia said they would suspend all flights to and from Doha indefinitely from Tuesday morning. Qatar Airways said on its official website it had suspended all flights to Saudi Arabia. Many Gulf airports, including in Qatar, are major hubs for international connecting flights. The measures are more severe than during a previous   rift in 2014, when Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE withdrew their ambassadors from Doha, again alleging Qatari support for militant groups. At that time, travel links were maintained and Qataris were not expelled. Neighboring Kuwait has been mediating in the dispute, and its emir, Sheikh Sabah       urged Qatar’s ruler to calm tensions and refrain from escalating the rift, Kuwait state news agency Kuna said.   called on Qatar’s Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa   to give efforts at mediation a chance to contain differences, a few hours after Khalid   an adviser to the Saudi king, visited Kuwait.

President Donald Trump will get a chance to patch up   ties this week when he meets with NATO allies still rattled by his failure on an earlier trip to embrace the principle that an attack against one member is an attack against all.

{"article": "In his testimony today before the Senate Judiciary Committee (on which I’ll have more to say in an upcoming column) FBI director James Comey has stuck by his claim that declining to bring charges against Hillary Clinton for mishandling classified information was the right call because proof of intent was lacking. This is unsurprising. The director has repeated this analysis many times. It hasn’t gotten better with age, but given his insistence that “no reasonable prosecutor” could possibly disagree with him, I’m not holding my breath waiting for him to reverse himself. \tIn my column over the weekend, discussing a lengthy New York Times report about the Clinton   investigation, I briefly rehashed why Comey is wrong about this: \t\tThis is a convoluted part of the story, stemming from the Justice Department’s effective rewriting of the applicable statute to avoid charging Clinton. As the Times tells it, the Justice Department and the FBI knew that to charge Clinton with a crime, it would not be enough to prove she had been “sloppy or careless” instead, “they needed evidence showing that she knowingly received classified information or set up her server for that purpose. ” As I have contended before, this claim is specious on multiple levels. Subsection (f) of the pertinent statute (the Espionage Act, codified at Section 793 of Title 18, U. S. Code) makes it a felony to mishandle classified information “through gross negligence”  —   i. e. proving Clinton was sloppy or careless (or “extremely careless,” to use Comey’s own description) could have been sufficient. But beyond that, Clinton willfully set up a private network for the systematic handling of her State   communications, in violation of federal   requirements of which she was well aware, and under circumstances in which she (a former senator who served for years on the intelligence Armed Services committee) was a sophisticated longtime consumer of classified information. She was keenly aware that her responsibilities as secretary of state would heavily involve classified information  —   whether it was “marked” classified or “born classified” because of the subject matter. \t\tIt is irrelevant whether Clinton’s purpose was to transmit or store classified information on the private,   server prosecutors are not required to prove motive. The question is whether she knew classified information would end up on the server, and her   made that inevitable. \t\tThat is, Clinton could have been prosecuted either for willfully mishandling classified information or for doing so through gross negligence. \tAs I elaborate in the column, the Times did not address the controlling statute in its   article. Instead, the story was that Clinton could not be charged because of the purported Petraeus precedent. We are to believe that the evidence of former CIA director David Petreaus’s criminal intent was far stronger than Clinton’s, yet he was not charged with the felony mishandling of classified information (he was permitted to plead guilty to a misdemeanor) ergo, it would have been an abuse of prosecutorial discretion to charge Clinton with the felony. \tI addressed this in the column as well: \t\tThis line of reasoning is fatuous  —   and it’s another instance of the Justice Department adopting Clinton campaign cant. Petreaus shared his classified diaries with a single person, a paramour who actually had a security clearance (albeit not one high enough to view what she was shown). Clinton’s offense was more extensive in duration and seriousness. \t\tAssuming the accuracy of the Times’s account, Comey is quite right that Petraeus should have been indicted on much more serious charges (as I have contended). But the Justice Department’s dereliction in Petraeus’s case was hardly a justification for giving Clinton a pass on a more egregious offense that, unlike Petraeus’s, (a) almost certainly caused the compromise of government secrets to foreign intelligence services and (b) resulted in the destruction of tens of thousands of government records  —   a separate felony. Clinton’s misconduct should have been prosecuted under the governing law, not excused based on the sweetheart plea deal Petraeus got. \t\tAll that said, we’re told the FBI thought it might be able to get over the purported Petraeus hurdle if it could find   to and from Clinton’s old BlackBerry. Because she was using this device right before she switched to the homebrew server, the theory was that those lost   might contain some   declaration of her criminal intent in setting up the server system. It’s as if, in a drug case, it’s not enough for agents to have the bag of heroin they found in the suspected trafficker’s house to prove intent, you apparently also need an   in which the trafficker says, “Gee, I hope there’s enough heroin in that bag I was planning to sell. ” \tHillary Clinton is a   lawyer who worked in government for many years. She was a very active first lady during her husband’s   presidency  —   mainly in the White House, where the handling of classified information is a major issue, even for   staffers. I mistakenly said in the weekend column that she had served on the Intelligence Committee in the Senate but my memory lapse was due to having previously said, correctly and on many occasions, that her assignment to the Armed Services Committee during years when the nation was at war made her a heavy consumer of highly classified   information. \tWhen she became secretary of state, she was briefed on the rules governing the handling of classified information, which she well knew would feature prominently and persistently in her duties. In her memoir, Hard Choices, Mrs. Clinton goes on at length about the exacting security procedures she knew she had to follow in handling classified information (e. g. she needed to read classified documents under an “opaque tent” in her hotel rooms while on travel and it was foremost in her mind that State Department officials are “frequently the target of cyberattacks”). \tWhen she was interviewed by the FBI at the close of its investigation, Clinton made laughably false statements regarding her familiarity with   protocols, including the whopper that she did not know what “(C)” meant  —   even though it is the designation for information classified at the “confidential” level, ubiquitous in classified documents. Prosecutors routinely use false exculpatory statements to prove mens rea in a criminal case. (Relatedly, Clinton also told the FBI she could not recall being briefed about retaining government records and handling classified information even though she signed a form acknowledging that she had been so briefed on January 22, 2009.) Moreover, in newly released book Shattered, about the 2016 Clinton campaign, authors Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes relate the story of how Clinton directed a trusted aide to download the server from her failed 2008 campaign in order to peruse stored staff   so she could figure out who leaked to the press. \tPatently, Hillary Clinton was well aware of (a) the highly classified subject matter of communications that would inevitably be passing through the private   system she set up for State Department business, in violation of statutes and government rules (b) the fact that   are stored on servers (c) the fact that the communications facilities and devices used by State Department officials are routinely targeted in cyberattacks by foreign intelligence services and other hostile actors and (d) the rules for the proper handling of classified information (and potential penalties for mishandling it). Consequently, her mishandling of classified information was knowing and intentional, as well as grossly negligent. Many reasonable prosecutors would salivate at the prospect of taking such a case to court, especially if they knew that Clinton was going to run with a “lack of intent” defense.

{"article": "During the buildup to the AFC championship game in the Mile High City, the spotlight was fixed on Manning and Brady, the two future Hall of Fame quarterbacks who were meeting for the 17th, and perhaps final time on the gridiron. But it was the Denver defense that stole the show, intercepting Brady twice in the opening half and making two crucial fourth down stops late in the fourth quarter to snuff out potentially game tying scoring drives, including one with just 2:18 on the clock. The Patriots, however, would not quit and with 12 seconds left Brady hit Rob Gronkowski with a   touchdown pass. Needing a   convert to force overtime, the Denver defense again dug in, with Bradley Roby stepping in front of Brady’s pass attempt to preserve the victory and a spot in their   eighth Super Bowl. Manning, who had been plagued by injury and questionable form all season, turned in a performance worthy of a   NFL Most valuable player, tossing a pair of first half touchdowns to Owen Daniels. ”To be going to our second Super Bowl in four years is very special and just an awesome effort by our entire team,” Manning, who will become the oldest quarterback to play in a Super Bowl, told the Denver crowd. ”And what an incredible effort by the Patriots, for us to beat that team today, a very special win.” ”It’s been a special rivalry (with Brady) over the course of our career . .. I just wanted to take the time to share with Tom (Brady) and Bill (Belichick) how much respect I have for them and just what special coaches and players they are.” Added Denver coach Gary Kubiak: ”Defensively we played our tails off all year long and found a way to win another close one.” Denver’s pass rush that led the league in sacks kept Brady under pressure the entire game, forcing the Patriots quarterback to hurry passes and miss targets. Brady completed 27 of 56 pass attempts for 310 yards but was sacked four times, intercepted twice and picked off again on a   attempt as New England’s Super Bowl defense ended. ”For it to come down to a   conversion obviously is a tough way to finish the season,” offered a dejected Brady after the game.  ”You make some, you’re not going to make them all.” ”It was a tough day. Hard fought football game. (The Broncos) put a lot of pressure on you. ”We had some tough plays we just didn’t make them. Just came up one play short.” Denver got the game off to a flying start, as Manning marched the Broncos 83 yards on their opening possession, completing the drive with a   dart to Daniels. Brady, meanwhile, was unable to do much against Denver’s top ranked defense until Jonathan Freeny alertly scooped up a Manning backward pass giving New England the ball on the Broncos 22. Two plays later Steven Jackson powered over from the one. Denver, however, maintained a   lead when Stephen Gostkowski missed his first extra point in 10 years. The Broncos also capitalized on a turnover, Von Miller intercepting Brady at the New England 20 and Manning quickly arching a   touchdown strike to Daniels. The half ended with the Broncos and Patriots hitting on long field goals to send Denver into the break up  . The Patriots began the second half chipping away at the Denver lead with Gostkowski connecting on a   field for the only score of the quarter. Denver’s Brandon McManus answered with a   field goal in the fourth quarter to restore the Broncos’ eight point cushion before Brady mounted a last ditch Patriots rally.  (Editing by Andrew Both.

{"article": "After waiting 58 years to return to a major tournament, Wales made up for lost time with a thrilling victory that gets their Euro 2016 campaign off to the best possible start. It was a dramatic match that swung one way and then the other before Hal   who is currently out of contract with Reading, upstaged Gareth Bale to emerge as an unlikely hero. Introduced as a   substitute, and at a time when the game was in danger of slipping away from Wales after Ondrej Duda had come off the bench to equalise for Slovakia with his first touch,   steered home a   shot to spark wild celebrations on the pitch and in the stands. It was only his third international goal and, with only nine minutes remaining, could not have been timed better. That Joe Ledley, who broke his leg five weeks ago to the day, was involved in the buildup to the defining moment in the match only added to the sense of satisfaction for Wales at the final whistle. Bale flung his head back and roared into the sky at the end of an absorbing game of football that left Chris Coleman’s players looking physically and emotionally drained. The sight of three points on the board should help to accelerate their recovery and, given the new format that opens the door for four   teams to qualify for the knockout stage, Wales could be forgiven for thinking they already have one foot in the last 16. At the very least, they can go into the “Battle of Britain” with England in Lens on Thursday full of confidence and with the pressure off. Bale, as ever, delivered for his country, yet this was not one of those days when it was all about the world’s most expensive footballer. The Real Madrid forward scored a superb   to put Wales ahead and had a powerful header saved in the second half, but for long periods of the game Bale was on the periphery, bereft of service and isolated in attack, no more so than in the   spell at the start of the second half when Slovakia took control of the game. With the excellent Marek Hamsik becoming more and more influential and Wales unable to retain possession, Duda’s   equaliser had been coming. The worry for Wales was that Slovakia were not finished there, which is why Coleman’s decision to bring on Ledley and   was so crucial, not just in terms of their contribution to the winning goal but also to break up the rhythm of the game. There was also something else that happened around the time of those substitutions that captured the mood on this historical day for Wales. With the team looking like they were running on empty, the 25, 000 Wales fans inside the stadium broke into a stirring rendition of the national anthem. Little wonder that Bale said afterwards that it felt like a home game for Wales. It was quite an occasion for Danny Ward, the    Liverpool goalkeeper who was drafted into the team on the eve of the match after Wayne Hennessey was forced to pull out after suffering a back spasm. Ward made his Wales debut only in March and had never previously started a game for his country, but he is entitled to be proud of his performance, as well as a touch relieved that Adam Nemec’s late header struck the upright. Wales will feel that they did enough to deserve that break. After a nervous start, when Hamsik slalomed through the Wales defence and was denied a brilliant individual goal only by Ben Davies’s superb clearance, Coleman’s side started to move the ball with more belief and grew into the game. Bale’s goal was a beauty and there was a sense of inevitability about what was going to happen from the moment that Jonny Williams was brought down by Patrik Hrosovsky 30 yards from goal. Matus Kozacik, the Slovakia goalkeeper, lined up his wall but made the fatal mistake of taking a step to his left just as Bale started his   leaving a gaping hole on the other side of the goal. Bale, with a dipping   thumped the ball into that area and, although it was not in the corner, Kozacik had too much ground to make up to try and get across his goal. Wales were aggrieved they never had a chance to double their advantage from the penalty spot when Martin Skrtel, trying to shepherd the ball out of play, elbowed Jonny Williams in the face. That incident went unpunished, unlike the poor defending that Duda exposed to equalise shortly after he came on. Robert Mak got away from Aaron Ramsey and Dave Edwards far too easily on the Slovakia right and the winger’s neat   was dispatched by Duda, who drilled a low shot across Ward and into the far corner. Bale and Ramsey both had headed opportunities either side of Duda’s goal but Slovakia also continued to threaten as the game became stretched. Wales badly needed some inspiration and they got it via the substitutes’ bench. Ledley, on for Edwards, threaded the ball into the feet of Ramsey, who nicked it past Skrtel and, a little fortuitously, into the path of  . Shooting on the turn, the striker scuffed the ball through the legs of Jan Durica and past Kozacik. Wales were in dreamland.", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> After waiting 58 years to return to a major tournament, Wales made up for lost time with a <span class=\"technique8\" id=\"row0annotation1\" technique8=\"0.55\"> thrilling </span><sup class=\"technique8\" id=\"row0annotation1\">8</sup> victory that gets their Euro 2016 campaign off to the best possible start.

{"article": "Attorney General Jeff Sessions sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee Monday to ”supplement” testimony given during his confirmation hearings in January, in which he said “I did not have communications with the Russians. ” In fact, Sessions met twice with the Russian ambassador to the United States during the 2016 presidential campaign, despite denying any contact to Sen. Al Franken ( ) during his confirmation hearings. Sessions said in a press conference last Thursday that he had “focused my answer on” a breaking news story mentioned by Franken that members of Trump’s campaign had had repeated contact with Russian nationals, including intelligence officials, during the campaign, “My reply to the question of Sen.

{"article": " (CNN) Meryl Streep was honored at the Golden Globes for a lifetime of notable work, and she took the opportunity to make a sustained attack on US   Donald Trump. In a nearly   address while accepting the Cecil B. DeMille Award, the actress denounced Trump’s campaign rhetoric and criticized him for mocking a disabled reporter. Related: Trump attacks Streep for speech at Golden Globes, As the audience of Hollywood stars and executives sat in silence, Streep said: ”There was one performance this year that stunned me. It sank its hooks in my heart. Not because it was good, there was nothing good about it, but it was effective and it did its job. ”It was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter. Someone he outranked in privilege, power and the capacity to fight back.” Streep’s comments were a reference to a rally by Trump in November 2015 when he imitated New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, who has a condition that affects his joint movements. Trump has always denied he was mocking the reporter. In an interview with the The New York Times Monday morning, Trump said he was ”not surprised” by the criticism from ”liberal movie people,” pointing out that Streep was a supporter of his defeated rival, Hillary Clinton. Streep used her speech to highlight the importance to American culture of outsiders and foreigners, whom she said were among the ”most vilified segments in American society right now.   ”Hollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners and if we kick them all out, you’ll have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts, which are not the arts,” Streep said to huge applause from the room. RELATED: Golden Globes 2017: ’La La Land’ breaks record, Streep said Trump’s attack on the New York Times reporter legitimized bullying.  ”It kind of broke my heart when I saw it and I still can’t get it out of my head because it wasn’t in a movie, it was real life,” Streep said. ”This instinct to humiliate when it’s modeled by someone in the public . .. by someone powerful, it filters down into everyone’s life because it kind of gives permission for other people to do the same.” Streep added: ”When the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose.” She called on the press to ”hold power to account, to call him on the carpet for every outrage”    another apparent reference to Trump.  Streep asked audience members to support the nonprofit Committee to Protect Journalists ”because we’re going to need them going forward and they’re going to need us to safeguard the truth.” The Golden Globes are awarded by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. Trump: Streep is a ’Hillary lover’ Responding to Streep’s speech, Trump again denied mocking Kovaleski. ”I was never mocking anyone,” Trump told the New York Times. ”People keep saying I that I intended to mock the reporter’s disability, as if Meryl Streep and others could read my mind, and I did no such thing.” Trump, who had not seen the speech, called Streep ”a Hillary lover,” according to the Times.  At the Globes and online, Streep received support from her peers.  Audience members listened with rapt attention. Actress Kerry Washington appeared near tears in the audience when the camera cut to her. On Twitter, the actress Julianne Moore wrote: ”Thank you #MerylStreep.” ”Everything she said. Thank you #MerylStreep for you work and everything you said tonight,” added Laverne Cox. The response to Streep’s speech wasn’t all positive.  Fox News host Sean Hannity tweeted: ”This is exactly why Hwood is DYING, what a bunch of hypocrites. Sex, violence, and drivel rule hwood. Turning the channel.” Radio host Meghan McCain, daughter of Republican Senator John McCain, added: ”This Meryl Streep speech is why Trump won. And if people in Hollywood don’t start recognizing why and how   you will help him get  .” Streep also drew some criticism from the Mixed Martial Arts community.  In a letter posted to Twitter, Scott Coker, an MMA promoter and fighter, invited Streep to an upcoming event in Los Angeles so she can see ”that Mixed Martial Arts is truly artistic.”  Streep closed her speech with a quote from her late friend Carrie Fisher: ”Take your broken heart, make it into art.” ", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> (CNN) Meryl Streep was honored at the Golden Globes for a lifetime of notable work, and she took the opportunity to make a sustained attack on US Donald Trump.

{"article": "On January 1, the Seattle City Council’s tax on guns and ammunition takes effect, thereby raising the prices on guns and ammunition for   citizens throughout the city. [Sponsored by City Council President Tim Burgess, the tax places another $25 on the price of a gun and “2 or 5 cents [on every] round of ammunition,” depending on the type of ammunition purchased.  According to The Seattle Times, the NRA filed a lawsuit in August to block the implementation of the tax, but King County Superior Court Judge Palmer Robinson “dismissed” the suit. The NRA cited the fact that Washington state has a preemption statute, which “forbids municipalities from passing regulations that impact ‘registration, licensing, possession, purchase, sale, acquisition, transfer, discharge, and transportation   …     or any other element’ of firearm ownership or commerce. ” But Judge Robinson viewed the tax as something other than regulatory in nature, and thereby upheld Seattle’s right to tax firearms and ammunition. Robinson opined that the tax on guns and ammunition is covered by “the City’s constitutional and legislative authority to impose taxes, which is separate from its regulatory authority under its police power,” and is therefore not hindered by the state preemption statute. The NRA disagreed and promised to appeal the decision. Until then,   residents of Seattle will pay more for every gun and bullet they buy for   within city limits. Breitbart News previously reported that Chicago enacted this same tax in 2013. Homicides rose in 2014, and they rose even higher in 2015. In fact, numbers from the Chicago Tribune indicated that by November 23, Chicago homicides for 2015 had already exceeded homicides for all of 2014. Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.

Further reading  Note, however, that Trump’s new White House page doesn’t promise to pull out of the Paris climate accords, which now seems to be a bit of an open question. Here’s a longer analysis of Trump’s energy policies. Note that oil and gas production already reached   highs under Obama, and it will be tough for Trump to vastly increase output, especially with prices for both so low. And here’s a look at all the obstacles Trump will face if he tries to dismantle Obama’s climate and environmental rules, including the Clean Power Plan.

None have yet been charged or identified. </div>", "key": "c9e4c23e-48a1-11ec-afba-6e0781bad58a", "sentence_propaganda": [{"confidence": 0.06377574056386948, "prediction": "Non-prop", "tags": ["O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O"], "token_confidences": [0.9968301653862, 0.9970259070396423, 0.997832715511322, 0.9976876974105835, 0.9975746273994446, 0.9978300929069519, 0.9942463040351868, 0.994697093963623, 0.996134877204895, 0.9941482543945312, 0.9913538098335266, 0.9964092373847961, 0.9969087243080139, 0.9970846772193909, 0.997596800327301, 0.9972858428955078, 0.9970031380653381, 0.9958369731903076, 0.9946868419647217, 0.9968738555908203, 0.9964913725852966, 0.9974609613418579, 0.995698094367981, 0.9971069693565369, 0.9969043135643005, 0.9983307719230652, 0.9980497360229492, 0.997776448726654, 0.9976406097412109, 0.9983148574829102, 0.9978050589561462, 0.9975157976150513, 0.9978190660476685, 0.9976944327354431, 0.9978367686271667, 0.9976147413253784, 0.9982251524925232, 0.998332679271698, 0.9979653358459473, 0.9980676770210266, 0.998136043548584, 0.9983552098274231, 0.9982535243034363, 0.9982861876487732, 0.9984531402587891, 0.9985390901565552, 0.9978175163269043, 0.9982757568359375, 0.9980528354644775, 0.9972430467605591, 0.998009979724884, 0.9981654286384583, 0.9977685213088989, 0.9979987740516663, 0.9981297850608826, 0.9983299374580383, 0.9989295601844788, 0.9986403584480286, 0.9989567995071411, 0.9979085922241211, 0.9984752535820007, 0.9987534284591675, 0.9986746311187744, 0.9987882971763611, 0.9988096952438354, 0.9983139038085938, 0.9964321851730347, 0.9973241090774536, 0.9962943196296692, 0.9985169768333435, 0.9989929795265198, 0.9989031553268433, 0.9978504180908203, 0.9983441829681396, 0.9980752468109131, 0.9976576566696167, 0.9985296726226807, 0.9981902241706848, 0.9985765218734741, 0.9982715845108032, 0.9970300197601318, 0.9981751441955566, 0.9985278844833374, 0.9984089732170105, 0.9984166622161865, 0.9985201954841614, 0.9972360730171204, 0.9983335137367249, 0.9986125230789185, 0.9982593655586243, 0.9972688555717468, 0.998202919960022, 0.9983100891113281, 0.9976455569267273, 0.9983265995979309, 0.9984357953071594, 0.998625636100769, 0.9985731840133667, 0.9986193180084229, 0.9985502362251282, 0.998832643032074, 0.9988608360290527, 0.99885094165802, 0.9987220168113708, 0.9988383650779724, 0.9987693428993225, 0.9985859394073486, 0.9987332224845886, 0.9977374076843262, 0.9986047148704529, 0.9985028505325317, 0.9985711574554443, 0.9984152317047119, 0.9986685514450073, 0.998674750328064, 0.998755931854248, 0.9987611770629883, 0.9983546137809753, 0.9986925721168518, 0.9988227486610413, 0.9987310767173767, 0.9987616539001465, 0.9987888932228088, 0.9987420439720154, 0.9987204074859619], "tokens": ["LONDON", "(AP)", "—", "British", "police", "have", "arrested", "three", "women", "as", "part", "of", "a", "continuing", "counterterrorism", "investigation", "that", "included", "a", "raid", "last", "week.", "[Police", "said", "that", "three", "women", "were", "arrested", "Monday", "morning", "on", "suspicion", "of", "planning", "attacks.", "Two", "are", "18", "and", "one", "is", "19.", "They", "are", "being", "questioned", "at", "a", "police", "station", "outside", "London.", "Police", "say", "the", "arrests", "are", "part", "of", "an", "ongoing", "operation", "related", "to", "a", "series", "of", "arrests", "that", "began", "Thursday", "when", "police", "stormed", "a", "house", "in", "northwest", "London.", "One", "woman", "who", "was", "shot", "during", "that", "raid", "was", "arrested", "after", "she", "was", "discharged", "from", "a", "hospital.", "So", "far,", "a", "total", "of", "10", "people", "have", "been", "arrested", "as", "part", "of", "the", "investigation.", "None", "have", "yet", "been", "charged", "or", "identified."]}], "success": true}},
{"article": "China’s leaders have been accused of delivering a calculated diplomatic snub to Barack Obama after the US president was not provided with a staircase to leave his plane during his chaotic arrival in Hangzhou before the start of the G20. Chinese authorities have rolled out the red carpet for leaders including India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, the South Korean president, Park   Brazil’s president, Michel Temer, and the British prime minister, Theresa May, who touched down on Sunday morning.  But the leader of the world’s largest economy, who is on his final tour of Asia, was forced to disembark from Air Force One through a   exit in the plane’s belly after no rolling staircase was provided when he landed in the eastern Chinese city on Saturday afternoon. When Obama did find his way on to a red carpet on the tarmac below there were heated altercations between US and Chinese officials, with one Chinese official caught on video shouting: “This is our country! This is our airport!” “The reception that President Obama and his staff got when they arrived here Saturday afternoon was bruising, even by Chinese standards,” the New York Times reported.  Jorge Guajardo, Mexico’s former ambassador to China, said he was convinced Obama’s treatment was part of a calculated snub. “These things do not happen by mistake. Not with the Chinese,” Guajardo, who hosted presidents Enrique Peña Nieto and Felipe Calderón during his time in Beijing, told the Guardian.  “I’ve dealt with the Chinese for six years. I’ve done these visits. I took Xi Jinping to Mexico. I received two Mexican presidents in China. I know exactly how these things get worked out. It’s down to the last detail in everything. It’s not a mistake. It’s not. ” Guajardo added: “It’s a snub. It’s a way of saying: ‘You know, you’re not that special to us.’ It’s part of the new Chinese arrogance. It’s part of stirring up Chinese nationalism. It’s part of saying: ‘China stands up to the superpower.’ It’s part of saying: ‘And by the way, you’re just someone else to us.’ It works very well with the local audience. “Why [did it happen]?” the former diplomat, who was ambassador from 2007 until 2013, added. “I guess it is part of Xi Jinping playing the nationalist card. That’s my guess. ” Bill Bishop, a China expert whose Sinocism newsletter tracks the country’s political scene, agreed that Obama’s welcome looked suspiciously like a deliberate slight intended “to make the Americans look diminished and weak”. “It sure looks like a   snub,” Bishop said. “This clearly plays very much into the [idea]: ‘Look, we can make the American president go out of the ass of the plane. ’”  Bishop added: “We’ve no proof. It could clearly just be a   but it would be a stunningly large   given how well these people plan for all these events and especially for something like the G20. The idea that they have been preparing for well over a year for the G20 but suddenly there be a malfunction with the ramp just for one president   …     that really strains credulity. ” A Chinese foreign ministry official involved in the visit denied it had been a snub, telling the South China Morning Post the US delegation had declined to use the usual rolling   staircase.  “It would do China no good in treating Obama rudely,” the official, who declined to be named, was quoted as saying.  “China provides a rolling staircase for every arriving state leader, but the US side complained that the driver doesn’t speak English and can’t understand security instructions from the United States so China proposed that we could assign a translator to sit beside the driver, but the US side turned down the proposal and insisted that they didn’t need the staircase provided by the airport,” the official added. The US president offered a diplomatic reply when asked to comment on the airport “kerfuffle” on Sunday during a joint press conference with Theresa May. “I wouldn’t   the significance of it because, as I said, this is not the first time that these things happen and it doesn’t just happen here. It happens in a lot of places including, by the way, sometimes our allies,” Obama said, adding that “none of this detracts from the broader scope of the relationship”. Obama suggested his Chinese hosts might have found the size of the US delegation “a little overwhelming”.  “We’ve got a lot of planes, a lot of helicopters, a lot of cars and a lot of guys. If you are a host country, sometimes it may feel a little bit much. ”  Susan Rice, the US national security adviser, admitted she had been surprised by the handling of the president’s arrival. “They did things that weren’t anticipated,” she told reporters.  The New York Times said Rice had appeared “baffled and annoyed” that the president had been forced to leave Air Force One through a door normally reserved for   trips to places such as Afghanistan.  In the   to the final meeting between Obama and Xi, experts had predicted the pair would seek to part ways on a positive note with the announcement that the world’s two largest polluters would ratify the Paris climate agreement.  However, Obama’s unconventional welcome  —   and a series of subsequent skirmishes and quarrels between Chinese and US officials and journalists  —   were a reminder of the underlying tensions.  The Washington Post said Obama’s bumpy landing in China was “a fitting reflection of how the relationship between these two world powers has become frayed and fraught with frustration”.  “I think this time   …     maybe the seams were showing a little more than usual in terms of some of the negotiations and jostling that takes place behind the scenes,” Obama admitted on Sunday.  Official statements issued by both sides on Saturday, as the pair held more than four hours of bilateral meetings, hinted at some of the disagreements between the world’s two largest economies.  According to a White House statement, Obama told Xi of “America’s unwavering support for upholding human rights”.  “China opposes any other country interfering in its internal affairs in the name of human rights issues,” Xi told Obama in response, according to Xinhua, Beijing’s official news wire.  In an interview with CNN, Obama warned Beijing against   in the South China Sea. Xi told Obama his country would “unswervingly safeguard” its claims in the region.  Bishop said: “Other than in climate, in most areas of the   relationship there is increasing amounts of friction and some actually increasingly quite hot friction around the South China Sea and some of these military [interactions] in the region. ” “The US is looking a little weak and a little tired and I think [Beijing is] happy to put anybody in their place when they can. I think they see the opportunity to make Obama look weak,” he added.  Both Bishop and Guajardo said the reported confrontations between Chinese and US officials and journalists following Obama’s arrival in Hangzhou were par for the course in China. “That is just typical China. I remember when my president came, one of the Mexican press corps came out of it with stitches,” Guajardo recalled. But Obama’s unceremonious arrival was unusual and surely deliberate, the former Mexican ambassador added. “Just as the Chinese are about giving face they are also about not giving it and letting you know that they are not giving it to you   …     They don’t overlook these things by mistake. It’s not who they are. It’s not the way they do these things,” he said.

{"article": "’Read Melania Trump’s lawsuit here’] Melania Trump filed a lawsuit Thursday against the Daily Mail and a Maryland political blogger for defamation for publishing what she said are false stories about her past. Trump is suing the outlets  —   which include Webster Griffin Tarpley, who runs Tarpley. net, a political website  —   over stories that claimed she worked as a “  escort” and that she suffered from a “  nervous breakdown” due to the stress of the campaigning, according to her complaint. The suit said Trump is suing each outlet for “in excess” of $75, 000  —   her lawyer said she will seek $150 million. Trump states in her lawsuit that those accusations are blatantly false. “[Trump] did legitimate and legal modeling work for legitimate business entities,” the complaint states. “[Trump] was not an escort or prostitute. [Trump] did not have an apoplectic fit, apoplectic tantrum, nervous breakdown or mental breakdown, nor is she terrified or obsessed by fear about revelations from her past. ” Trump’s lawyer, Charles Harder, who recently represented Hulk Hogan in his battle with Gawker, released this statement on behalf of his client: “These defendants made several statements about Mrs. Trump that are 100% false and tremendously damaging to her personal and professional reputation. Defendants broadcast their lies to millions of people throughout the U. S. and the world —  without any justification,” he said. “Their many lies include, among others, that Mrs. Trump supposedly was an “escort” in the 1990s before she met her husband. Defendants’ actions are so egregious, malicious and harmful to Mrs. Trump that her damages are estimated at $150 million dollars. ” The Daily Mail responded Thursday to the lawsuit publishing a lengthy retraction. In the retraction, the newspaper states their article merely discussed allegations that were made about Trump in a book on Amazon and in an article by a Slovenian magazine. But the newspaper said it did not intend to state that the allegations that Trump worked as an escort or in the sex business were true. “To the extent that anything in the Daily Mail’s article was interpreted as stating or suggesting that Mrs. Trump worked as an ‘escort’ or in the ‘sex business,’ that she had a ‘composite or presentation card for the sex business,’ or that either of the modeling agencies referenced in the article were engaged in these businesses, it is hereby retracted, and the Daily Mail newspaper regrets any such misinterpretation. ” Tarpley also responded saying Trump’s lawsuit against him is “without merit. ” Tarpley said he is confident that Trump will not be able to prove the statements about her on his website were defamatory. He added, “her lawsuit is a blatant attempt to intimidate not only me but journalists of all stripes into remaining silent with regard to public figures. This lawsuit is a direct affront to First Amendment principles and free speech in our democratic society. ”   ", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> ’Read Melania <span class=\"technique5\" id=\"row0annotation1\" technique5=\"0.51\"> Trump’s lawsuit here’] </span><sup class=\"technique5\" id=\"row0annotation1\">5</sup> Melania Trump filed a lawsuit Thursday against the Daily Mail and a Maryland political blogger for defamation for <span class=\"technique5\" id=\"row0annotation2\" technique5=\"0.80\"> publishing what she said are false stories about her past. </span><sup class=\"technique5\" id=\"row0annotation2\">5</sup> Trump is suing the outlets — which include Webster Griffin Tarpley, who runs Tarpley. net, a political website — over stories that claimed she worked as a “ escort” and that she suffered <span class=\"technique9\" id=\"row0annotation3\" technique9=\"0.92\"> from a “ </span><sup class=\"technique9\" id=\"row0annotation3\">9</sup> nervous breakdown” due to the <span class=\"technique8\" id=\"row0annotation4\" technique8=\"0.78\"> stress of the campaigning, according </span><sup class=\"technique8\" id=\"row0annotation4\">8</sup> to her complaint.

{"article": "For all the criticism of Golden State’s Draymond Green and his penchant for committing flagrant fouls during these playoffs, Wednesday may have brought the harshest words yet. The critic: Green himself. Saying he let the Warriors down and that he was a “terrible ” Green spoke on how it pained him to be suspended for Game 5 of the NBA finals  —   and how he will make amends on Thursday night in Game 6, when the Warriors visit the Cleveland Cavaliers and get another shot at winning what would be their second straight championship. “I owe to my   to come back and give all that I have, all that I can do to better this situation,” Green said. “I have strong belief that if I play Game 5, we win. But I didn’t because I put myself in a situation where I wasn’t able to play. ” He added: “The way I view it, [I was an] awful, terrible   and I take pride at being better. ” Golden State lead the series   but now knows they will play the rest of the series without starting center Andrew Bogut because of a left knee injury. Green  —   who missed Game 5 because of how many flagrants he has accrued during the playoffs  —   will be called upon to play some center in Game 6, as he has plenty of times in this postseason already. “Draymond is the spirit of what we do,” said Warriors guard Stephen Curry, the NBA’s   reigning MVP. “You see it out on the floor. ” This series is back in Cleveland largely because LeBron James and Kyrie Irving could not be stopped in Game 5, when the Warriors’ best defender was watching the Cavaliers’ star duo score 41 points apiece from a suite at the adjacent baseball stadium that the Oakland Athletics call home. Green alone could not have stopped their onslaught, but it surely stands to reason that life would have been more difficult for Cleveland if he was in uniform. Without Green, the Warriors lost by 15. He’s already spoken to his   about his mistakes, and made clear that watching Game 5 from next door left him hurting. “Everybody’s helped with Draymond being on the floor,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “So that will be nice to have him back. We missed him the other night. We were disappointed in our performance without him. We thought we could still get it done, but we didn’t. So now it’s time to recharge the batteries and get ready. ” The straw that got Green suspended was when he took a swipe at James’ groin area in Game 4. But when asked what he expected when he sees Green in Game 6, James showed he’s only focused on bigger pictures and no    battle. “My only job is to get this win, man,” James said. Green met with reporters before practice, and didn’t shy away from his mistakes in these playoffs. Some thought he merited a suspension when he kicked Oklahoma City’s Steven Adams in the groin area during the Western Conference finals. The NBA upgraded the foul and fined him after reviewing that play, and when another flagrant was assessed    for taking the shot at James a suspension was automatic. “I move on from the suspension. We move on. It was Game 5. We’re here in Game 6,” Green said. “So it’s behind us. We’ve got an opportunity to do something that, I don’t know if it’s ever been done . .. where you win a championship on someone else’s floor two years in a row. ” Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue was asked if his team might try to prod Green a bit, knowing another flagrant foul or two technicals in Game 6 would mean another suspension for Game 7. “You just play the game,” Lue said. Green, who acknowledged that he’s been working on keeping emotions in check, didn’t sound worried. “I think I’ve got to come out and play my game regardless,” Green said. “But there are those little fine lines where you just know you can’t cross them. ” If Cleveland win, Game 7 is in Oakland on Sunday. If Cleveland lose, the Warriors will celebrate on the Cavs’ home floor for the second consecutive year  —   exactly one year to the day from last year’s clincher. And if Golden State get to spray champagne the cramped visiting locker room at Quicken Loans Arena around again, those bubbles will likely wash away most of not all the sting Green is feeling for letting his team down. “Nobody will remember this down the road if we get this done tomorrow night,” Curry said. “So that’s really all we need to talk about. ”", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> For all the criticism of Golden State’s Draymond Green and his penchant for committing flagrant fouls during these playoffs, Wednesday may have brought the harshest words yet.

{"article": "On the 2016 campaign trail, Donald Trump has insisted that he is worth more than $10bn. However, a statement filed to the Securities and Exchange Commission by Wells Fargo Securities on Trump’s behalf in 2012 indicated that the real estate developer was then worth less than half that, with comparatively few of the liquid assets that may now finance his campaign for president. In the document, which concerned the securitization of commercial mortgages on properties including Trump Tower in New York City, Trump was described as being worth more than $4. 2bn, with liquid assets of more than $250m.  A passage in the   filing says: “The sponsor is Donald J Trump. Mr Trump has significant commercial real estate holdings worldwide including interests in office, retail, residential,   and hospitality properties in markets including New York, San Francisco, Florida, Washington DC, and Scotland. As of 30 June 2011, Mr Trump reports a net worth in excess of $4. 2bn and liquidity in excess of $250m. ” The Trump campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  Jessica Ong, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo, insisted the 2012 filing was correct.  She said: “Obviously, if it was inaccurate, we wouldn’t have filed it with the SEC. ” While $250m is a large amount of money, it is nowhere near enough to finance a modern presidential campaign. Trump has already loaned between $43m and $50m to his campaign, raising questions about how much he can afford to continue to spend without selling off assets or taking on significant loans.  Trump has insisted that he has far more than $250m in liquid assets, last year telling Fox News anchor Sean Hannity he had $400m, all of which he was prepared to use. In sworn testimony for a 2007 lawsuit, deposition transcripts show, Trump was asked by a lawyer whether he had “ever exaggerated in statements about your properties?” “I think everyone does,” Trump answered. The lawyer pressed: “Does that mean that sometimes you’ll inflate the value of your properties in your statements?” “Not beyond reason,” Trump said. Trump’s claim to be able to   his campaign has been a foundation of his   successful claim to be independent of the Washington establishment. Although he is now frantically building a fundraising apparatus, he has insisted this is simply to help the Republican National Committee (RNC) raise money for the party as a whole. His campaign reported only $1. 3m “cash on hand” to begin the month of June, in contrast to Hillary Clinton’s $42. 5m. The RNC has not seemed overly concerned. Speaking to CNN in June, the group’s chief strategist, Sean Spicer, said that if Trump “wanted to get that [fundraising] number up in two seconds, he just strokes a check and it’s up”. The Trump campaign has insisted that the businessman has converted his loan into a donation. No such paperwork has yet been filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC).  The 2012 SEC filing contradicts a claim made by Trump in November 2011, in which he said he had a net worth of more than $7bn and insisted that he derived almost $3bn from the value of his personal brand. In May 2016, Trump filed a statement with the FEC in which he insisted his “net worth is in excess of $10bn”. The disclosure indicated that he had taken on at least $50m in debt and sold off assets in the past year. While the statement from Wells Fargo indicates that Trump may be far less wealthy than he claims, it would also indicate that he is in better financial shape than many financial experts believe, unless he has suffered significant undisclosed financial losses in recent years.  Fortune magazine has estimated that Trump is currently worth $3. 9bn in 2015, Bloomberg News assessed Trump’s fortune at $2. 9bn.  Another billionaire, Mark Cuban, has scoffed at Trump’s claims, suggesting the presumptive Republican nominee may not be a billionaire at all. Cuban’s reading of Trump’s most recent financial disclosure was that Trump may only have $165m available.", "sentence": {"content": "<div> On the 2016 campaign trail, Donald Trump has insisted that he is worth more than $10bn.

{"article": "Police in Malaysia announced this week the arrest of fifteen people suspected of fundraising, recruiting, and attempting to purchase and amass   materials for the Islamic State (  ) terrorist group. One of those arrested is a police officer. [Reuters reports that some of the fifteen suspects are believed to have been operating together under the orders of Muhammad Wanndy Mohamed Jedi, an Islamic State operative with Malaysian roots, located in Syria. Some were plotting an attack within Malaysia’s borders, while others were working to recruit more jihadis for the cause or fundraise to help bring plots to fruition.  They were involved in collecting funds to be channeled to an Islamic   group in the southern Philippines and arranging the movement of “two foreign terror suspects” from Malaysia to a Southeast Asian country, [Malaysian Inspector General] Khalid Abu Bakar said. Other activities included attempting to acquire chemicals to make bombs, recruiting Malaysians to join Islamic State in Syria, collecting funds from Islamic State sympathizers in Malaysia and setting up working arrangements with militant groups around Southeast Asia, he said. Malaysian officials have grown increasingly tense regarding the potential threat of an Islamic State attack in the Southeast Asian country, which boasts a majority Muslim population. On Friday, a shopping mall in Peringgit shut down after a written note surfaced claiming terrorists had planted four bombs around the mall. While the threat proved to be a false alarm, the swiftness with which Malaysian authorities reacted highlights the fears of a potential successful terror attack unfolding in the near future. Malaysian police announced this week an initiative not just to capture and contain Islamic State jihadists, but to counter their propaganda online. “We cannot afford to wait,” Inspector General Khalid said on Friday. “That’s why every single piece of information, no matter how small that links a person with Daesh members, we will take action against them. ” The initiative will launch April 1 and will boast an online   recruitment team in every state of Malaysia. Police did not provide details on what the   messaging centers will post online specifically. Earlier this month, Malaysian authorities announced they had thwarted an Islamic State plan to abduct Prime Minister Najib Razak, as well as several of his ministers. “On January 30, 2015, there were plans by 13 people linked to Daesh [Islamic State] to kidnap the country’s leaders including the Prime Minister, the Home Minister and the Defence Minister,” Home Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi told reporters. “Although there is no proper Daesh establishment in the country, those here [in Malaysia] were being influenced and have been receiving orders from the IS network in Syria,” he explained. The arrests this week prove the ties between ISIS jihadists in Syria and supporters in Malaysia. The Islamic State is far from the only jihadist group operating in Malaysia, however. Malaysia’s The Star reported in January that there are four major Syrian rebel   jihadi groups recruiting in Malaysia: “the IS, Ajnad   the   Front (also known as   in Syria) and the Free Syrian Army. ” The Malaysian government and native Islamist groups also work to impose Islam as a state religion, though they denounce the Islamic State. The government admitted this week that it has made lists of “liberal Muslim” citizens to be targeted. The “deviants”  —   labeled such for believing in   ideals such as “pluralism,” will be the target of “efforts to sway them back to traditional religious beliefs. ” Among deviant activities, according to Sharia, as practiced in Malaysia are public interactions between men and women, including hugs and kisses on the cheek and any interaction with dogs, which are considered haram [forbidden].", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> Police in Malaysia announced this week the arrest of fifteen people suspected of fundraising, recruiting, and attempting to purchase and amass materials for the Islamic State ( ) terrorist group.

View Archive   Facebook Google+   He seems to have taken a timeless insight often attributed to H. L. Mencken  —   that no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American people  —   and applied it to politics. Don’t believe me? Take but one recent, nearly   example.  On Sunday’s “Face the Nation,” host John Dickerson asked the Republican presidential   what he took away from a recent church service that he attended in Iowa. The subject of the sermon: humility.   Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump spoke in front of a crowd in Iowa following the caucuses. Trump finished second to Ted Cruz. (Reuters)   Behold this   exchange: TRUMP: “It was very good. It was very a nice service, beautiful church. I liked it. ”  DICKERSON: “But humility, a lot of people don’t think  —   your name is on everything. You have often talked about sometimes braggadocio is part of your pitch. ”  TRUMP: “No, I know, but there is more humility than you would think, believe me. ”  DICKERSON: “Hidden humility. ”  TRUMP: “We are all the same. We’re all going to the same place, probably one of two places, you know, but we are all the same. And I do have actually much more humility than a lot of people would think. ”  Got that? Trump is very, very, unbelievably, terrifically humble. And (with apologies to Churchill) he has much to be humble about.  Trump, after all, is a man who has previously declared himself to be, in roughly his own words: ● Really rich; very rich; very smart; very handsome; very strong on the Second Amendment; very strong on border security; very, very strong on the debt limit; very loyal, to a fault.  ●In possession of the world’s greatest memory, as well as one of the highest IQs.  ●   but not necessarily one of these people who sits there all day and thinks about himself.  ●Like Ronald Reagan, FDR, Batman.  ●Loving of   beloved by the Mexican people, China, Iowans, “the blacks,” “the Muslims,” women, everybody.  ●Very friendly with a lot of people on both sides of the aisle, a very nice person who gets along very well with people, a great unifier.  ●The worst thing that ever happened to the Islamic State, the least bigoted of anybody you’ve ever met, the least racist person on earth, the person who will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.  And of course: ●A candidate who could shoot somebody in the middle of New York’s Fifth Avenue and not lose voters. If these aren’t the statements of someone with boatloads of humility, well, maybe Trump doesn’t know what the word “humility” means.  Or, more likely, he doesn’t think the rest of us do. Likewise, on issues besides his own character, Trump has also taken to   voters’ intelligence.  He absurdly promised to make Mexico pay for a big, beautiful wall that would keep Mexicans out of the United States. (In my fantasies, this wall would really be a scheme to make Mexico and the United States fall madly in love, “Fantasticks” ; alas, such an outcome seems unlikely.)  Among his other infrastructure priorities is a new $100 million ballroom for the White House. “We’ll get the top people, the top everything, we’ll have the best ballroom,” he said at a recent political rally, as if he believed this were really a   policy issue crucial to the success of the American republic.  He promised that his tax plan would raise taxes on the rich and not reduce revenue, even though basic arithmetic and the most generous of economic assumptions say the opposite. He promised to get rid of Obamacare and replace it with “something terrific” but as yet unspecified. He promised to grow the nation’s economy by 6 percent or 7 percent, when the Federal Reserve predicts   growth rates of 2 percent.  Only someone who thinks Americans are really, really dumb would expect voters to buy any of this.  Of course, Trump is hardly the only candidate to treat voters like we have IQs around room temperature.  Other candidates’ tax plans, foreign policy proposals, regulatory schemes and economic predictions also often depend on assumptions of widespread idiocy within the populace. And to some extent, this has always been true. But Trump, innovative political entrepreneur that he is, has just gone bigger and bolder, assuming Americans are even dumber than anyone ever thought possible. Not that Americans themselves agree. In a recent Pew Research Center poll, about   of respondents said that the word “intelligent” describes the typical American fairly or very well.  The next few months will help determine who’s right.   Read more on this topic:   The Post’s View: The ‘ism’ that describes Mr. Trump best   Dana Milbank: Republican elites surrender to Trump   E. J.

{"article": "It’s tempting to look to the playbooks and historical traditions of the late Soviet Union to explain the audacity of today’s Russian intelligence activity, from its meddling in U. S. elections, to apparently killing Kremlin opponents abroad. But these activities are not just products of old ways or new geopolitics. They also stem from a shift in the activities of Russia’s political police force, the infamous Federal Security Service (FSB). Originally established to protect the Kremlin’s rule at home, it has increasingly moved into Russia’s foreign operations. A new cohort of secret policemen, ignorant of the traditions of spycraft and secure in Putin’s protection, has fundamentally altered the nature of Russian intelligence. The FSB stands accused not just of engineering the leaks against Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, but also backing extremist parties in Europe, stirring up discontent among   minorities in the Baltic, allegedly murdering Chechen opposition leaders in Turkey and Austria, spreading disinformation, and even kidnapping an Estonian security officer across the border in 2014. And according to the infamous unverified dossier published by Buzzfeed on January 10, it also collected compromising information on Trump with the suspected aim of turning him into Vladimir Putin’s puppet. One has to go back to Soviet times for such a rich array of proven and suspected covert adventures abroad. The Biggest Intelligence Questions Raised by the Trump Dossier, By allowing the FSB to move into foreign intelligence and covert operations, though, Putin has —  probably inadvertently —  unleashed a beast. The FSB is playing a central role in current developments not because it possesses greater technical capabilities than the other Russian agencies, but because, for the most part, it does not recognize or respect the same limitations as the rest of Russia’s security services. To put it crudely, the FSB does the kinds of things everyone else thinks about doing but doesn’t because they’re too risky, too politically inflammatory, or too likely to backfire. The FSB is just the latest,   iteration of the old Soviet KGB. In one of his many toxic legacies, former Russian President Boris Yeltsin ignored calls to disband an institution that appeared beyond repair and rebuild it from scratch. Instead, after 1991, he opted to partition the KGB. Its first chief directorate, responsible for espionage, was simply rebranded as the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). Most of the directorates tasked with domestic security were gathered together first under the umbrella of the Ministry of Security, then the Federal   Service, and, in 1995, the FSB. Since then, the FSB has not looked back, especially after 1998, when for a brief time it was headed by a     officer whose career was about to experience an unexpected boost —  one Vladimir Putin. In the years since, the FSB has been one his staunchest allies, hounding and discrediting his rivals, looking after his underlings, and clamping down on any spasms of popular protest. In return, he has shielded, empowered, and elevated the agency, turning a blind eye to corruption in its ranks, allowing it to   rival agencies such as the Federal   Service (Russia’s equivalent to the DEA, which was abolished in 2016) and giving its officers key positions, from regional governorships to head of his security council. Traditionally, Putin controlled Russia’s sprawling bureaucracy by creating multiple, overlapping agencies, that he would then play off against each other. This is especially evident within the intelligence community. In Ukraine, for example, the SVR, FSB, and GRU, the military intelligence agency, all ran competing operations. When former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych was toppled by the “Euromaidan” revolution in 2014, catching Moscow by surprise, the result was a hurried game of   . Although the FSB had been the agency most closely associated with Yanukovych and had argued most forcefully that he would survive, it enjoyed Putin’s support, and so the SVR wound up taking the blame for the intelligence failure. One result of the agencies fighting over the same turf has been the increasing intrusion of the FSB into foreign operations. In 2003, the agency absorbed most of the electronic eavesdropping and   capabilities of FAPSI, Russia’s equivalent of the NSA. In 2005, it began operating in   neighboring states. In 2006, Russia passed a law allowing military force to be used “to suppress international terrorist activity outside the Russian Federation” —  just before the murder of defector Alexander Litvinenko in London. As the FSB’s stature rose, that of its competitors in Russian intelligence was falling. By the late 2000s, the GRU was in disgrace, due to its blunders in Russia’s 2008 war with Georgia, leading to abandoned airfields being bombed and Russian units getting outflanked. Putin also felt the SVR was too conservative and timid for limiting itself to simple  . It had failed to present Washington as being as aggressive as he believed it to be. He was increasingly coming to believe that the United States was leading a campaign to isolate Russia and deny it the   status he felt it deserved. He saw the “Color Revolutions,” for example, as U. S.  plots to topple   governments (Georgia in 2003, Ukraine in 2004, and Kyrgyzstan in 2005) and interpreted NATO’s 2011 intervention in Libya as a sign that Washington remained committed to aggressive regime change. The more Putin came to see the West as a threat, the more he felt he needed his spooks both to collect information and to serve as active instruments of his geopolitical ambitions. This perspective seems to have crystallized during his brief time as prime minister and as the power behind the throne, from 2008 to 2012. The FSB scrambled to fill the spook gap left by the flailing GRU and SVR. Suddenly, it was briefing Putin on foreign policy, edging its way into the traditional turf of the SVR and the foreign ministry. It lobbied hard and successfully for the funds and the mandate to mount political operations, first in Europe, then beyond, from funneling resources to populist parties and separatist groups, to penetrating both Democratic and, to a limited extent, Republican National Committee computers. When an indiscreet conversation between Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and U. S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt emerged in 2014, it was almost certainly both intercepted and then leaked by the FSB. It may even have hijacked SVR and GRU operations: Intelligence insiders told me of FSB reports that claimed credit for information gathered by other agencies. The FSB could do all this because it had Putin’s trust, and because it realized that he increasingly wanted his spies to tell him what he wanted to hear. As one embittered former SVR officer put it to me, “our mistake was to keep talking about the world as it is, not as he would like it to be. ” Thus, the FSB’s political police officers flattered their way into a privileged position, getting tasked with manipulating elections, wooing electorates, and lobbying politicians across the West. These are not just spies under a different acronym, though. Most do not know or respect the etiquette of the shadow war. Their backgrounds as secret police in an authoritarian state make them especially prone to bullying and blackmailing, corrupting and killing. They also operate under far fewer constraints than traditional spies. So long as they remain in Putin’s favor, they can (sometimes literally) get away with murder. Even Russia’s   Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, once able to challenge the spies, is now limited to cleaning up their messes. This has all resulted in a brazen new turn in Russian intelligence operations, with the FSB at the helm. They were behind the   kidnapping of Estonian security officer Eston Kohver in 2014, and, according to sources in Moscow, were behind the DNC leaks, even if the GRU actually collected the emails. They are the ones most eagerly backing and bankrolling divisive extremists and populist leaders in Europe. This is despite the fact that the SVR and GRU have a great deal more experience. But the FSB’s greatest asset is its sheer willingness to take chances. In that respect, it is simply mirroring Putin himself, who has played his weak hand well, precisely by —  at least in the   era —  being more unpredictable and confrontational than anyone else. How will this work out in the long term? When the FSB kidnapped Kohver, it managed to draw attention to the very issue it sought to keep hidden: its own links with organized crime, which subsequently became the focus of more intensive investigation in both Estonia and Europe as a whole. One Italian   officer who had for years been warning about this problem, for example, told me that within a month he had been given the green light to open new investigations into corruption among Russian security officials. Similarly, the agency’s hacking of Western politics looks worryingly effective, but is generating a backlash in the West against Russian interference and disinformation. It has become the story of the moment on both sides of the Atlantic, with the German and French security services warning that Moscow will try to manipulate upcoming elections in both countries. Just as dangerously, the SVR, GRU, and other agencies, have followed the FSB’s lead in tailoring their briefings to flatter Putin’s prejudices and assumptions. As a result, the one man who decides Russian strategy has become cocooned in an   latticework of   dubious interpretations, and ludicrous optimism, which may make him prone to dangerous adventures —  deeper engagement in the Syria quagmire, a wider invasion of Ukraine, or tangling directly with NATO or China. In the long run, the FSB may well be as dangerous to Putin as to the West.", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> It’s tempting to look to the playbooks and historical traditions of the late Soviet Union to explain the audacity of today’s Russian intelligence activity, from its meddling in U.

{"article": " (CNN) As an only child growing up in Japan, photographer Izumi Miyazaki often let her imagination roam free. Armed with her mother’s silver Pentax, the young teen developed a peculiar approach to capturing the world around her. Surreal, grotesque and often humorous, her   seem to turn ”kawaii”    the Japanese descriptor for all things cute    on its head. In one photo, she’s beheaded    her clumpy insides spilling onto a pink backdrop. In another, her signature black bob is obscured by two slices of bread.   Appreciation for Miyazaki’s   style is growing, with thousands following her Tumblr account. And she recently finished her first solo exhibition at the Wild Project Gallery in Luxembourg. Below, the Tokyo’s Musashino Art University graduate discusses her work with CNN Style. RELATED: The world’s most beautiful instagram accounts to follow. .. What was it like growing up in Japan? It’s hard to describe because I don’t have anything to compare it to. But what I believe is that young Japanese people love to be part of a group    or even be classified in a category.  Even when they want to be original and stand out from the crowd, they tend to search for a group of similar people.  Personally, I am a little bit afraid to be cataloged or categorized. That is why I always try to be myself and don’t mind being alone. But perhaps I am in a group as well, without knowing it? Does photography run in the family? Actually, no. My grandfather used to take family pictures, but they weren’t very good. My mom tried too, but she wasn’t much better. When I held the camera for the first time, it felt very natural to me.  How do your photos reflect life and culture in Japan? They probably reflect life in Japan more than I think they do. But that’s not my intention. Although, I really like food    especially Japanese food    so you might see a lot of Japanese snacks in my photos. I don’t think my pictures show my personality. Or at least, if they do, I am not conscious of it. I take   and I am my own model. And yet, I feel that this model is another person. READ: They’re alive! A warped look at Japan’s skylines, How do you usually construct the scenes in your photos? First, I imagine what I want to do. I usually come up with ideas from everyday life. When I read books, watch TV, talk with friends . .. ideas just come up.  For example, I imagined that I wanted to cut my hair with an office paper cutter (Hair Cut, 2016) and I envisioned myself standing on a rice ball (Rice Ball Mountain, 2016). I think about composition carefully too. Does Japanese culture promote or inhibit creativity?   Yes, I think Japanese culture promotes creativity. I think Japanese people yearn for Western things, which unintentionally creates this original culture that I’m really interested in. How does social media influence your work? It’s difficult for me to answer this but thanks to social media, I can see so much variety and many, many things from all over the world. It inspires me to make something. How has your photography evolved over time? I take great care of the choice and balance of colors in each picture. The main evolution is my lighting technique and the use of Photoshop. When I was starting out, I took pictures of what I saw and didn’t make any changes to them. Now I compose the entire   myself and Photoshop has become crucial for my work.  How would you describe your photography style? That’s hard . .. I don’t feel that I have a style. I try to do what I want do, when I want to do it. I don’t really have a guideline or any steps that I like to follow. It is likely that one could classify me into one kind of style or another, but I just try to work in the moment.  Your photos feel quite cinematic. Where do you find your inspiration? Yes, there is some truth in this remark. Since my pictures are set up, this undoubtedly adds a cinematographic dimension. I really love the cinema    I love films like Amélie.  I also look towards American photographer Alex Prager as inspiration because she composes all her images, staging models and creating   scenes. I also like the work of Japanese photo artist Miwa Yanagi, where all the women ironically have the same expression and seem void of personalities.  READ: Youthful and effortlessly cool    Celebrating true Parisian style, What do you hope that viewers take away from your photos? I have no special message or purpose when I take photos. I only hope that visitors approach my photography with an open mind    with as much freedom of thinking as I try to have when I create a picture. Where do you hope to be in the next five years? I hope to have a bigger house, closer to the train station! But more seriously, I don’t know at all. To be honest, I don’t have a clear picture of what I would like to be or what I would like to achieve. I guess we will see.

{"article": "Madelyn Rubinstein moved to New York City from Long Island in 1985 with big dreams of making it as a professional pianist. She had a head start: a very cheap   apartment, recently vacated by her grandmother, on Central Park South. When Ms. Rubinstein took possession of it, her rent was $93. 08 a month  —   the same price that her grandmother had been paying since 1967. Several months later, Ms. Rubinstein came home one evening to find an eviction notice on her door. The building’s new owner, Donald J. Trump, wanted her out. Mr. Trump’s plan was to knock down the building and the one next door, which he also owned, and replace them with a luxury   condominium complex facing Central Park. What he got instead was a New York brawl with a group of tenants fighting to save their homes and clinging with white knuckles to some of the city’s legendary rent deals. The battle played out for years in courtrooms and the New York news media, becoming a kind of parable of the limits of 1980s capitalist ambition in the social democratic city. Looking back on the fight, on the eve of Tuesday’s New York Republican primary, one can see Mr. Trump waging a much different sort of campaign, but with many of the same tactics  —   the threats, the theatrics, the penchant for hyperbole  —   that he has deployed in his quest for the Republican presidential nomination. As far as the tenants are concerned, Mr. Trump lost that contest. “Oh, absolutely, we won,” said Ms. Rubinstein, sitting in the   apartment where she still lives. “He wanted this whole corner to be one big Trump building. ” But Mr. Trump refuses to admit defeat. “A great deal,” he said, without hesitation, when describing 100 Central Park South  —   now known as Trump Parc East  —   during a phone interview last week. “It was a long battle, but it was a successful battle. As usual, I came out on top. ” Mr. Trump paid just $13 million for 100 Central Park South and the building adjoining it, the Barbizon Plaza Hotel, in 1981. At the time, he was 35 and making bold strides to emerge from his father’s shadow. In recent years, he had built the   Trump Tower and overhauled the building near Grand Central Terminal that became the Grand Hyatt New York. This would be a no less audacious project, and on one of the city’s most desirable blocks. To realize his dream, he had to first clear out the residents of the building, a   tower with 80 apartments, some overlooking Central Park, nearly all inhabited by tenants paying well below market rates.   and   apartments occupy a kind of mythic place in New York City history. Rent protections were created to guard families from the whims of landlords and the market they still cover about one million apartments in the city. State laws limit their rent increases and guarantee tenants, and often their children and grandchildren, the right to stay. But in expensive neighborhoods, the deals can become skewed. At 100 Central Park South, for instance, there were   apartments overlooking the park with rents as low as $436 per month. Mr. Trump wanted all of the tenants out. But rather than buying them out, a common tactic, he and the management company he hired tried to get the job done free. So the battle  —   captured in numerous lawsuits, court documents and news media accounts from that time  —   began. Leaks went unfixed, tenants alleged, and broken appliances went unrepaired. Aluminum foil was placed over windows in empty apartments, giving the building a   appearance. (Mr. Trump defended the action as standard procedure for vacant units.) More dramatic were the eviction notices from Mr. Trump’s lawyers, on a variety of grounds. One tenant was told that he had not paid his rent on time. (He presented a canceled check in court to prove that he had.) Others who had done construction on their apartments, with the approval of prior landlords, were told that they had 10 days to restore them to their original conditions. Suzanne Blackmer, a   actress and one of the original Rockettes, was ordered to vacate her   unit, for which she paid $203. 59 a month, because it was not her primary residence, meaning she was not entitled to rent protections. Ms. Blackmer insisted that it was after a legal battle that lasted more than a decade, she prevailed. Mr. Trump made his opponents out to be millionaire plutocrats, “people of great wealth. ” And also whiners. “Let me tell you something about the rich,” he said in one interview in the midst of the battle. “They have a very low threshold for pain. ” Recounting the story later in his memoir “The Art of the Deal,” Mr. Trump acknowledged that he had deliberately tried to drive out tenants, but he said that most of them were exploiting an undeserved government subsidy. He recalled getting rid of a free telephone in the building’s lobby that he claimed tenants were using “to call their friends in Gstaad and St. Moritz. ” Ms. Rubinstein and two other residents from the time said they remembered only a pay phone in the building. And while its roll of renters included a successful fashion designer and an architect, it also included a number of older people living on fixed incomes. As Mr. Trump’s frustration with the tenants grew, he offered the building’s dozen or so empty units as shelters for the homeless, promising free apartments with “beautiful views. ” The city declined, questioning the wisdom of moving people into a building headed for demolition. “I actually thought it was a very generous offer,” Mr. Trump said last week. “I don’t want to see people out on the streets. ” The tenants eventually hired a lawyer, David Rozenholc, to represent them. Now a familiar nemesis to New York City developers  —   last year, he negotiated a $25 million total payout for three clients whom Tishman Speyer was trying to eject from a small apartment building in Hudson Yards  —   Mr. Rozenholc took advantage of a legal flaw in Mr. Trump’s plans to block his application to begin construction. He also sued Mr. Trump, accusing him of harassing Mr. Rozenholc’s clients. The lawsuit claimed, among other things, that the building’s superintendent had been instructed by the management to spy on tenants. Mr. Trump brought his own action against Mr. Rozenholc, a federal racketeering suit that sought $105 million in damages and found its way to The New York Post before it was filed. Mr. Rozenholc said the suit, which was dismissed, was entirely frivolous. But he offered some words for Mr. Trump that were relatively kind, given the men’s contentious history. “He knows how to negotiate, he knows how to use leverage and he’s very perceptive about his opponent’s vulnerabilities,” Mr. Rozenholc said. “It didn’t work against me, but when you deal with Putin and Iran, these could be useful qualities. ” The tenants were waging their own campaign in the news media, casting Mr. Trump as a slumlord and a bully. In 1986, after five years of fighting, Mr. Trump abandoned his plans to knock down the building. The tenants could stay in their apartments, paying their existing rents. Mr. Trump would never realize his vision for the project. But in a sense, his defeat had been a victory, as he claimed. Even as the tenants were refusing to budge, preventing any demolition or construction, the value of the property was soaring along with the rest of New York City’s real estate market in the 1980s. In the late 1990s, Mr. Trump finally converted the building into condominiums, but renters were allowed to remain. Today, some continue to rent   units for under $1, 000 a month, less than a third of what similar apartments cost. Ms. Rubinstein, who was guaranteed   rent for life, chose instead to buy at a steep discount, paying just $150, 000 for an apartment that is now worth at least $700, 000. She is also a member of the condo board, along with one of her more noteworthy neighbors, who lives on the building’s 13th floor: Mr. Trump’s son Eric.", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> Madelyn Rubinstein moved to New York City from Long Island in 1985 with big dreams of making it as a professional pianist. She had a head start: a very cheap apartment, recently vacated by her grandmother, on Central Park South. When Ms. Rubinstein took possession of it, her rent was $93. 08 a month — the same price that her grandmother had been paying since 1967. Several months later, Ms. Rubinstein came home one evening to find an eviction notice on her door. The building’s new owner, Donald J. Trump, wanted her out. Mr. Trump’s plan was to knock down the building and the one next door, which he also owned, and replace them with a luxury condominium complex facing Central Park.

{"article": "The era of big cable sports is over. [It ended on Wednesday, April 25, 2017, when ESPN began laying off 100 writers and   radio and television talent.  The era began after 2011, ESPN’s high water mark, with the network viewed in over 100 million households. Then, resulting from a combination of   and wanton leftist propaganda disguised as sports coverage, the cable dinosaur saw its once flourishing empire reduced to a relative fiefdom. ESPN lost over twelve million subscribers since 2012, and according to some reports, 10, 000 subscribers a day. The subscriber losses led to layoffs in 2013, and again in 2015. For much of America, and certainly most on the right, the message of ESPN’s historic setback seems clear: stop bringing leftist activism into our sports escapism. Cease using sports as a Trojan horse to masquerade a social justice agenda, and maybe people will want to watch your network. But, what lesson did ESPN take from their setback? For the purposes of this discussion, it’s more important to take a look at who ESPN didn’t layoff, as opposed to who they did. According to the sports media site Awful Announcing, which kept a tracker of the ESPN layoffs throughout Wednesday, of the 60   talent and writers who publicly acknowledged being laid off before midnight central time on Wednesday, none of them, not a single one, were among the usual suspects when it comes to purveying leftist activism at ESPN. Tony Kornheiser, who once likened Tea Party Republicans to ISIS remains at ESPN. So does his     partner Michael Wilbon. Bomani Jones, who once appeared on Mike  Mike in a “Caucasians” tee shirt remains at ESPN as does Kevin Blackistone, who once ripped Michael Jordan for donating one million dollars to the police. Granted, only 60 of the reported 100 have been laid off, and some of the more liberal personalities at ESPN could very well find themselves without a job on Thursday. However, as of the time of this writing, one thing is clear: If America’s   and ratings killing of ESPN was an attempt to send the message that we wanted less politics in their sports coverage, that message fell on deaf ears. Not that anyone should shed a tear about what happened on Wednesday. ESPN losing influence and power is a great thing. Anytime the people who gave Caitlyn Jenner the Arthur Ashe Courage Award lose the ability to influence young minds, that’s a win for America. However, the fact that ESPN laid off none of their worst political offenders, clearly shows that the leftists are still very much in control in Bristol, and if that didn’t change after losing twelve million subscribers, it won’t change anytime soon. Why does that matter? ESPN may have laid off nearly half their total talent on Wednesday, but they didn’t hang the “going out of business” sign on the door either. The era of big, cable sports died Wednesday, but the era of big liberal sports will go on. ESPN is currently investing massively in their digital properties, sensing that digital and online offerings will become the wave of the future as more and more people move away from cable and traditional television. But, if the same people who turned the ESPYs into an   Amendment infomercial are still calling the shots, then ESPN’s future digital properties will represent just as big a threat to our culture as they did when they appeared on Channel 206 of your DirecTV package. In fact, if anything, ESPN will likely become more political in the future, especially after their social justice agenda was so roundly rejected by so many. Sports fans who want to watch games and debate free of political persuasion won a battle yesterday. But, the war will go on.

{"article": "While the world watches America’s Cuban exile community celebrate the death of dictator Fidel Castro, those who have governed their own countries similarly have issued official statements of condolences for the communist caudillo, describing him as a “giant” among repressive autocrats who “resisted” the beacon of freedom 90 miles to his north. [Below, five responses from autocrats around the globe to Castro’s passing:  Venezuela: Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s dictator Nicolás Maduro  —   officially losing his status as president after suppressing a constitutionally permissible recall vote petition  —   issued a statement on state radio, comparing Castro to late Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chávez, who was a close ally of the Castro regime. “Amid the pain and the memories, we will always remember aloud our Comandante Chávez,” Maduro said on Saturday. “What a deep friendship they cultivated, a friendship of struggle and values  …     two revolutions harassed by the Empire, that have thrived and must continue to thrive. ” Syria: Bashar   While Syria and Cuba have few common needs as a state, the nations had long been allies on the international stage, voting together to advance the agendas of allies like China and Cuba at the United Nations. Embattled dictator Bashar   took some time out of his Saturday to praise Castro as a “giant leader” who has “throughout the decades led the struggle of his country and people against imperialism and hegemony with all aptitude and capacity. ” “The resistance of the Cuban leader has become legend and an inspiration for all the leaders and peoples of the world,” Assad reportedly said. “The name Fidel Castro will remain etched in the minds of all generations, as an inspiration for all the peoples seeking true independence and liberation from the yoke of colonization and hegemony,” Assad reportedly said.   Russia: Vladimir Putin, Like Castro, Putin has managed to perpetuate himself in power for years, and appears to have no plans of retiring. In his statement, Putin referred to Castro’s as a “free and independent Cuba, which he and his allies built. ” Castro, he claimed, “became an influential member of the international community and became an inspiring example for many countries and nations. “Fidel Castro was a sincere and reliable friend of Russia. He made a huge input in establishment and development of the   relations, close strategic partnership in all spheres,” the Putin statement reads. “He was a strong and wise person, who always faced future with confidence. He demonstrated high ideals of a politician, citizen and patriot, who is adamant in the right course, to which he sacrificed all his life. ” China: Xi Jinping, As a Communist leader in name  —   not just in practice like Maduro or Assad  —   Xi Jinping’s praise for Fidel Castro is to be expected. Xi called Castro a “great leader” in his statement of condolences to the Cuban communists, “adding that he has made immortal historic contributions and devoted all his life to the Cuban people’s great cause of struggling for national liberation, safeguarding state sovereignty and building socialism,” according to Chinese state outlet Xinhua. “The late Cuban leader has also made immortal historic contributions to the world socialist development, Xi added,” Xinhua notes. “The death of Fidel Castro has made the Chinese people lose a close comrade and sincere friend. His glorious image and great achievements will go down in history,” Xi concluded.", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> While the world watches America’s Cuban exile community celebrate the death of dictator Fidel Castro, those who have governed their own countries similarly have issued official statements of condolences for the communist caudillo, describing him as a <span class=\"technique9\" id=\"row0annotation1\" technique9=\"0.72\"> “giant” </span><sup class=\"technique9\" id=\"row0annotation1\">9</sup> among repressive autocrats who “resisted” <span class=\"technique8\" id=\"row0annotation2\" technique8=\"0.45\"> the </span><sup class=\"technique8\" id=\"row0annotation2\">8</sup> beacon <span class=\"technique8\" id=\"row0annotation3\" technique8=\"0.46\"> of </span><sup class=\"technique8\" id=\"row0annotation3\">8</sup> freedom 90 miles to his north.

{"article": "Two prominent north Texas Democrats are sounding the alarm on the threat of a   concern: voter fraud. [Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings (D) and State Representative Eric Johnson (  100) submitted a letter Thursday to Dallas County Elections Administrator Toni   after public concerns continued to mount about scores of reports involving a potential absentee voter fraud scheme.  “According to reports, dozens of voters received   ballots they never requested,” the letter states, which “suggests the possibility of a coordinated effort to benefit a candidate or candidates in the upcoming Dallas City Council elections. ” As Breitbart Texas previously reported, the episode began when West   pastor James Armstrong alerted local media and officials alike that some of his congregants came forward with evidence that absentee ballots were arriving at their respective homes without first asking for them, as Texas law requires. “It’s just a travesty that we are dealing with this,” Armstrong told NBC DFW at the time. “Seniors who have lived in this neighborhood all of their life and are now being taken advantage of. ” Another community resident, Alice Washington, 81, lodged similar complaints with the County via her niece, Barbara Roberson. “I said, ‘Would you please send me a copy of that application because I’d like to see her signature’,” Roberson told WFAA at the time. “Someone forged her signature,” said Roberson after review of the paperwork. In the week following, dozens of similar complaints have been made, according to Mayor Rawlings’ joint letter. The duo also notes a possible pattern in recent elections: What’s more startling is that this is the second time in less than a year that we have heard reports of irregularities in West Dallas. In November, media reports indicated someone fraudulently mailed ballots for dozens of elderly or dead voters. Previous Breitbart Texas coverage noted where election integrity experts explained root causes for the latest episode and steps Texas can take to fix the matter going forward: Election integrity advocates have argued that absentee ballot problems can sometimes be rooted in poor maintenance of the underlying voter records. The Public Interest Legal Foundation noted in response to the Dallas episode that Texas should consider tightening procedures for requesting absentee ballots. “As long as you have a name and address of another voter, you’re good to go   …     You don’t even need to give a birth date,” a group spokesperson told Lifezette. Analysts say that requiring absentee ballot applications to include driver’s license or other   identification numbers could cut down impersonation attempts like claimed by the Washington family. Recent fraud conspiracies prosecuted in southern Texas point to a possible example for how elderly voters are preyed upon through the mail voting system. After an unsolicited ballot arrives, an illicit     political operative would visit the recipient’s home, offering “assistance” with completing and returning the form with   candidates in mind. One recent Texas case involved a U. S. Postal Service delivery man taking bribes in trade for allowing “politiqueras” to follow his truck, indicating which homes received ballots. The mailman also allegedly took part in campaigning for local Democrat candidates while in uniform as well. Short of legislative reforms, Mayor Rawlings and Rep. Johnson were left to implore   to “devote additional resources to verify the integrity of each   ballot in Dallas. ” Rawlings Johnson Re Mail Ballots by BreitbartTexas on Scribd,  Logan Churchwell is a founding editor of the Breitbart Texas team.

{"article": "  Donald J. Trump appears to believe he owes little to the Republican establishment donor set, a majority of whom opposed him. He also ran a campaign that challenged longstanding shibboleths of American diplomacy. Mr. Trump’s choice of ambassadors could be a sign of how serious he is about both those stances. But as his transition team begins sifting through possible choices for a dozen major embassies, the signals are unclear. Two of his three choices so far, Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa for China, and David M. Friedman for Israel, are loyalists, not big donors. The third, Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina, picked as ambassador to the United Nations, was an ardent critic of Mr. Trump. Mr. Branstad has described President Xi Jinping of China as an “old friend” Ms. Haley and Mr. Friedman have no diplomatic experience. But the nomination of Mr. Friedman, a conservative who has been deeply critical of the   lobbying group J Street, and who has vowed to move the United States Embassy to Jerusalem, has roiled large sections of the foreign policy establishment  —   just the kind of disruption Mr. Trump liked to emphasize in his campaign. So far, Mr. Friedman is the exception. As the intense jockeying for ambassadorships has begun among donors, loyalists to Mr. Trump and, in some cases, people close to his children, his advisers have potentially competing priorities. If Mr. Trump chooses Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets who is a longtime Republican donor and a friend of the   or someone like Peter S. Kalikow, the New York developer and Trump supporter, he would be following a familiar script. If he chooses someone like Jon M. Huntsman Jr. for Japan, Mr. Trump would be trying to match a Republican establishment figure with a region he is familiar with. Mr. Huntsman has served as ambassador to China and Singapore. If he goes for someone like Robert Pence, a Virginia developer who did not support Mr. Trump’s candidacy but who has been recommended by Vice   Mike Pence, it would fall more in line with his choice of Ms. Haley and of bringing outsiders into the fold. (The two Pences are not related). The expectation is that Mr. Trump will begin by rewarding supporters with appointments to Western Europe or the Caribbean, as is often the case with new administrations. But they could also include donors to his campaign or transition, people he might need again in the future. “They generally start out more political,” said Asgeir Sigfusson, the communications director for the American Foreign Service Association. “The numbers will even out. ” In previous administrations, he said, about 70 percent of nominations were foreign service professionals and 30 percent were political appointees. It remains to be seen if Mr. Trump will adhere to that breakdown, Mr. Sigfusson said. Aides to Mr. Trump declined to comment, beyond saying that discussion about candidates was in the early stages. There are some favorites among the names Mr. Trump’s advisers are batting around, however, and meetings on the subject are expected to increase in frequency starting this week. Mr. Trump’s aides are sifting through a broad list of recommendations from people involved in the transition process, including the  ’s daughter Ivanka and his    Jared Kushner. As a result, the suggestions have included people who did not immediately support the Trump ticket, such as Ronald J. Gidwitz, who backed Jeb Bush in the primaries. There have been some aspirational suggestions, such as Mr. Huntsman, who served as ambassador to China in the Obama administration, for Japan or Michèle A. Flournoy, a top Pentagon official in the Obama administration, as an ambassador to NATO. The two have deep knowledge of policy and have been spoken of favorably by Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief White House strategist. But a number of Mr. Trump’s top advisers oppose them. Then there are more personal recommendations from people involved in the transition. One was for Morris Goldfarb, the chief executive of the   Apparel Group, which had a licensing agreement for Ms. Trump’s apparel line. Another was former Gov. James Gilmore of Virginia, who has been recommended by Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, a Trump adviser. Ivana Trump, Mr. Trump’s first wife, cheekily recommended herself to The New York Post for ambassador to the Czech Republic. John Jay LaValle, chairman of the Suffolk County Republican Committee in New York and one of Mr. Trump’s few vocal defenders in the campaign’s final days, could see a plum post. And there are a raft of donors and longtime Republicans angling for appointments who could expect particularly close scrutiny by Democrats during confirmation hearings. “I think confirmation is always problematic,” said Mel Sembler, a party   appointed ambassador to Australia by the elder President George Bush and to Italy by the younger. “The first time out, it was a long and embarrassing and difficult process,” Mr. Sembler said. Old scars become new information as senators start their review, he said. Some donors could see old troubles resurface. Mr. Kalikow, the New York developer, who filed for personal bankruptcy when he owned The New York Post more than two decades ago, has been mentioned for a possible post. So has Georgette Mosbacher, a socialite whose husband, now deceased, was the focus of a lawsuit over a flawed census count in 1990. Neither Mr. Kalikow nor Ms. Mosbacher would comment for this article. Duke Buchan, major supporter of Jeb Bush and a defender of the work of Right to Rise, the “super PAC” backing that candidate, joined the Trump effort in the summer and contributed significantly to his campaign. Mr. Buchan has expressed interest in becoming ambassador to Spain, where he says he studied and where a company he once held stock in recently owned property. He also used to own shares in a company that holds military contracts, records show. Mr. Buchan, who does not know Mr. Trump well, has had blunt discussions about how to best position himself for an ambassadorship, according to people close to the transition. He did not respond to requests for comment. Fred V. Malek, a former aide to President Richard M. Nixon and to the elder President Bush, said that being a donor did not guarantee anything. “It doesn’t mean that somebody can be a   and just have an ambassadorship,” he said. “They have to have some credentials. ” At least two prospective candidates from the donor community, according to people with direct knowledge of the discussions, are likely to end up with posts. Lewis M. Eisenberg, the Republican National Committee finance chairman who raised money with Mr. Trump’s choice for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, is seen as a possible choice for Italy. Mr. Johnson, the Jets owner, is a leading choice for Britain. Joseph Forgione, who was passed over for secretary of housing and development, has support to become ambassador to the Vatican. So does William E. Simon Jr. an ally of Rudolph W. Giuliani, who recommended him. R. Nicholas Burns, an ambassador to Greece under President Bill Clinton, said that the State Department typically put forward a list of people to consider, and that incoming presidents should be aware of their options. “I think   Trump would be well advised to broaden the circle of people he consults in making these appointments,” Mr. Burns said.", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> Donald J.

{"article": " On Saturday night, following the HBO premiere of Beyoncé’s second visual album, Lemonade, the world went to bed not knowing if they would ever learn the true identity of ”Becky with the good hair.”    According to a verse on Lemonade, Becky was the other woman who the love of Beyoncé’s life was cheating with. During both her solo career and her years as a member of Destiny’s Child, Beyoncé’s music has often referenced the trifling, perhaps fictional, humans who have wronged her  —   from the man who would would max out a young Bey’s card, give her bad credit, and buy her gifts with her own ends to the hater who said she couldn’t breathe without him to the man who showed his ass and became the best thing Beyoncé never had. But those songs, like many other pop songs, have always stopped short of identifying the foolish or confirming if those people even existed. Initially, it seemed that Becky and her good hair would be one of those amorphous ghosts  —   a placeholder for the wrath of Beyoncé’s fans’ ire, a cipher whose sole purpose is to be a lightning rod of anger, a universal punching bag.    But, just as Saturday night was starting to bleed into Sunday morning, something funny happened.    Becky might have revealed herself. What did Becky with the good hair do to Beyoncé?                                       Becky and her good hair are integral to Lemonade. The album’s first four songs and videos depict a howling, scalding rage, setting the bones for everything that follows. The narrative is that the love of Bey’s life  —   the implicit message is that it’s Jay Z, but more on this in a bit  —   cheated on her and lied to her, and she found out. ”You remind me of my father, a magician, able to exist in two places at once. In the tradition of men in my blood,” Bey recites during the ”Intuition” video vignette.    At the center of the maelstrom is the other woman, the mistress, the side chick. And that woman is addressed in ”Sorry,” the fourth song on the album, as ”Becky with the good hair.” Bey sings: ”He only want me when I’m not on there. He better call Becky with the good hair.” It’s a throwaway diss, and Beyoncé is actually doing ”Becky” a favor by putting her into a witness protection program of sorts. She’s not dragging Becky through the mud. She’s not making her a target of the Beyhive, Beyoncé’s loyal fanbase. But we know that she’s someone we shouldn’t like because even though she apparently has good hair (which could also be seen as a throwaway diss   a commentary on how smooth, straight hair is considered desirable and attractive) she is a person who didn’t respect Beyoncé’s marriage and caused her pain.    To be clear, Beyoncé is pretty ruthless toward Jay in the song, even if she doesn’t name him directly; she’s much more harsh to him than she is to Becky. Beyoncé isn’t just blaming Becky, but she’s also making it clear that Becky isn’t some innocent bystander. Did ”Becky with the good hair” reveal herself? In the hours following the Lemonade premiere, fashion designer Rachel Roy posted an interesting update to Instagram. Attached to a picture of herself and a friend was the caption, ”Good hair don’t care, but we will take good lighting, for selfies. or self truths, always. live in the light #nodramaqueens”:            The phrase ”Good hair don’t care” might as well have been written in fire. Roy posting that line to the internet and her thousands of followers was like a person jumping into the lion’s den, but only if said person was wearing a vest of ribeye steaks and bacon underwear. To the casual observer, Roy and Bey’s shared usage of ”good hair” might be a coincidence. But there’s much more to it than that. Who is Rachel Roy? And is she Becky? Roy is probably best known for being a fashion designer who’s made multiple appearances on Project Runway and appearances on Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Unless you’re into fashion or reality television, you probably have no idea who she is. But to faithful members of the Beyhive, Roy has been floating around in Beyoncé’s orbit as a   villain for the last couple of years.    Roy’s origin story with music’s most powerful couple begins with her stint as an intern at Jay Z’s clothing line Rocawear after she finished college (around 1996). According to Teen Vogue, she worked in every department, and eventually worked her way up to become a creative director. This plays into Roy’s role in the Great Elevator Fight of 2014, when Beyoncé’s sister Solange infamously attacked Jay Z while the two shared an elevator after the Met Ball. Make no mistake, Roy wasn’t in the elevator when everything went down. But her existence may have spurred Solange’s attack on Jay. Everyone knows what happened in the elevator. Leaked security video of the fight  —   which showed Solange attacking Jay Z  —   went viral online. And Beyoncé later addressed the incident in the remix to her song ”Flawless,” where she talks about shit going down when there’s a ”billion dollars in an elevator.” But there’s a secondary story from that same night that never received as much attention: Solange had a   with Roy before she got into that fateful elevator. At the time, US Weekly reported that Beyoncé got involved, but it wasn’t clear what was said or why the two fought. Later, The Daily News reported that Solange fought with Jay because of Roy and Jay Z’s working relationship possibly becoming more. ”Rachel is a little too close to Jay Z,” the Daily News’s source said. ”Solange doesn’t like it, and Beyoncé doesn’t like it.”    Meanwhile, Wendy Williams connected the dots and alleged that Roy and Jay may have had a sexual relationship when she was an intern at Rocawear, suggesting that something like a flirty look or a greeting that was a little too comfortable set Solange off at the Met Ball party:  Fast forward to 2016 and ”Becky with the good hair,” and this theory that Roy is Becky begins to make sense. She has pretty hair that looks nice, which she touts as her most remarkable feature. She wrote a message about said hair hours after Beyoncé’s Lemonade premiere. She used some of the same phrasing Beyoncé used to describe said hair. She has prior drama with the Knowles family. And if Lemonade is seen as Beyoncé addressing that fight and the rift with her relationship with Jay Z, then everything about Roy being ”Becky” locks into place. What’s more uncertain at this point is why the spirit moved Roy to post that Instagram picture with that caption. Was it a cry for attention? Does she have bad friends who encouraged her to do it? Is she not of sound mind? Rachel Roy feels the sting of the Beyhive Beyoncé’s Beyhive didn’t waste any time in dragging Roy. They began responding to the picture, so much that Roy flipped her Instagram account to private. Her Wikipedia page was also changed, referring to Roy as ”Rachel Roach,” or a ”Dusty Side Hoe that died under a lemonade stand.” There was even some spillover to celebrity chef Rachael Ray’s social media mentions because of their similar names and because people were not too familiar with Roy. Amidst the internet fury, Roy tweeted an odd message that appeared to be about Lemonade, her Becky connection, and her haters. Rather than directly deny having an affair with Jay Z, she instead made a declaration about how despicable bullying is:      I respect love, marriages, families and strength. What shouldn’t be tolerated by anyone, no matter what, is bullying, of any kind.\n  —   Rachel Roy (@Rachel_Roy) April 24, 2016    She’s right. The internet hate was ugly and obscene. The attacks were uncalled for. But still, Roy didn’t explain why she used the phrase ”good hair don’t care” in the first place if she didn’t want the glare of the Beyhive upon her. Before Roy’s Instagram post, no one knew who Becky was nor was anyone really thinking about Roy. And now everyone was. How much of Lemonade is autobiographical? The most shocking thing about Lemonade is how blunt and raw its songs and poetic interludes are. Beyoncé talks about her father. She talks about the love of her life. She talks about how both of those men have hurt her with their dishonesty and infidelity. There are points where the album is so unapologetically uncomfortable that it becomes this sublime piece of art. But the thing about Beyoncé is that she has never been known for being an open person. In fact, in this age of leaks and social media, she’s managed to keep everything a secret. Look at Lemonade  —   no one knew what to expect when it premiered on Saturday night after being announced just a week or so before, just like no one knew she was going to drop her Beyoncé album with no prior marketing or promotion in 2013. When it comes to media access, Bey’s reputation is that she doesn’t give many interviews. In 2015, the New York Times published an analysis of Beyoncé’s media presence (or lack of one) noting that though she was on the cover of the September issue of Vogue  —   the holy grail of magazine covers  —   she didn’t grant the magazine an interview. The New York Times reported:  At some imperceptible point around 2013 to 2014, she appears to have stopped giving    interviews. A member of her team told a reporter in May that despite numerous appearances, Beyoncé had not answered a direct question in more than a year. Her publicist declined to clarify this stance. (When Beyoncé does answer questions, it tends to be in writing or, for TV, taped.)     It’s fascinating that the biggest pop star on the planet is the most private one. It’s also incredible that Beyoncé has such a full handle on her image. Everything is seemingly on her own terms. That’s led to this idea that we never get the ”real” Beyoncé. Vulture’s Nitsuh Abebe examined this criticism in 2013, explaining that people see a machine instead of a human when they look at Beyoncé:  Here, after all, is a criticism one hears of Beyoncé qua pop star: that she is ”flawless” in an empty, dutiful way. That beneath the    performances and public togetherness, there lies a robot. Or, if not a robot, then something like the kid who’s been so pressured and trained to master a skill that he lacks any kind of feeling beyond his perfect technique —  a   imposing blank.  If you expand this theory  —   that everything Beyoncé touches is constructed by Bey and her team  —   it puts a different spin on her personal life. Everything we think we know about her life is something she wants us to know. From the sexual ecstasy  expressed in the songs on Beyoncé to the fight in the elevator to the visceral pain in Lemonade and Becky’s good hair Instagram post  —   it’s all part of her grand design. I’m not quite sure how much of that theory I buy. But if it’s true, then I’ll admire the skill needed to pull that off instead of being miffed that I fell for it. Lemonade is no exception. It’s Beyoncé’s most personal album yet. That’s why everyone was so shocked to hear the words spoken and sung about Jay and her father. But only Beyoncé knows how much of it, if any of it, is authentic.    Her version of the story is the only version of the story. And that she doesn’t owe or give anyone an explanation about which parts are real, that she doesn’t have to make her life and her art more helpful for our understanding, is much more intriguing than any side chick she’s singing about.  11 songs you didn’t know were Prince songs    ", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> On Saturday night, following the HBO premiere of Beyoncé’s second visual album, Lemonade, the world went to bed not knowing if they would ever learn the true identity of ”Becky with the good hair.” According to a verse on Lemonade, Becky was the other woman who the love of Beyoncé’s life was cheating with.

{"article": " (CNN) Teenage recruits were raped by staff and forced to rape each other as part of initiation practices in the Australian military going back to 1960, a public inquiry heard on Tuesday. The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse is hearing evidence from men and women who say they were sexually abused when they were as young as 15, in certain divisions of the Australian defense force. This commission is focusing on alleged abuse at the naval training center HMAS Leeuwin in Western Australia and the army apprentice school Balcombe in Victoria during the 1960s, ’70s and ’80s and also among cadets with the Australian defense force since 2000. READ: Pentagon: Sexual assault cases in the military remain constant,  In total, 111 victims came forward to report abuse. More than a dozen of them will give evidence to the inquiry in Sydney, which continues until July 1.  ”On multiple occasions, I was snatched from my bed in the middle of the night by older recruits and dragged to a sports oval,” said one male witness who wasn’t named.  The witness said he was forced to rape other recruits, and was raped himself by older recruits and staff.   ”The environment made it useless to resist,” he said. ”One could stand only so much abuse before realizing that saying ’no’ was pointless. After a while compliance and getting it over and done with seemed the best solution.”  Many survivors say that when they reported the abuse, they were ignored, punished, or told it was ”a rite of passage” in their initiation period. READ: Report: Military punishes sex assault victims,  Another witness,    Graeme Frazer, told the inquiry that as a    naval recruit in 1967, he remembers being ”terrified” as he was dragged from the showers, beaten and sexually abused by three other recruits.  He said one of the attackers tried to force him to give oral sex, then they held him down while his genitals were covered with boot polish and scrubbed with a hard brush.  ”I still feel a lot of guilt and shame about the abuse,” Frazer said. ”I have suffered depression.”  The inquiry also will hear evidence from former and current staff members, and examine the handling of complaints and the responses to claims for compensation.

Weighing only 20 pounds and about the size of a small dog, it is considered a micro pup because it is about half the weight it should be for its age. Despite its sickly state, Sea World officials told FoxNews. com that they were cautiously optimistic that they could nurse it back to health and eventually return it to the wild. It is currently in Sea World’s rehabilitation center, where veterinarians and animal care specialist are stabilizing the pup and hydrating it. Sea World officials believe the sea lion found into its way into the restaurant a warm, dry place to rest. The pup is only the latest young sea lion to turn up in a strange place along the California coast. With high tides as well as warming waters from El Nino limiting the sea lions food supply, they have been increasingly washing up on shore since 2013  —   turning up on beaches and found wandering on California city streets. In San Diego alone, Sea World has rescued 40 sea lions already this year and 990 in all of 2015  —   a record number of rescues in a year.", "sentence": {"content": "<div> Maybe she had come for the wild prawns or the stunning sea views.

{"article": "Mary Keitany, a    mother of two, went out for a run on Sunday morning. She started at the foot of the   Bridge on Staten Island and worked her way through the city. About 10 miles into her run, in South Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Keitany picked up the pace, the first signal to those running with her that she was not in the mood for a group run. She soon surged again, effectively saying, “Goodbye, everyone I’ll see you at brunch. ” It was no ordinary weekend run. Keitany, a marathon dynamo who trains at 7, 500 feet in Kenya’s western highlands, put on a virtuoso solo performance that is uncommon for the streets of New York. It resulted in her third consecutive New York City Marathon title. She was so far in front of her competitors that she could have taken a stroll through the Sheep Meadow in Central Park on her way to the finish line. Instead, Keitany took the most direct path, at a punishing pace that no one else could maintain, her      body gliding along for 26. 2 miles without any apparent struggle. Keitany finished in 2 hours 24 minutes 26 seconds, with the   finisher nowhere in sight. “I was not planning to do this, but I had a time I wanted to run, and I needed to keep the pace,” Keitany said of her breakaway. “I’ve run alone many times, and I trained well. And if anyone caught me, I was going to chase them. ” A    from Eritrea, Ghirmay Ghebreslassie, won the men’s race. He emerged from a tight pack of three at Mile 20 and blew kisses at onlookers as he won in 2:07:51. He is the youngest winner in race history. Ghebreslassie, who won the world championship in Beijing in 2015 at 19, took fourth place in the Rio Olympics. He was followed Sunday by Lucas Rotich of Kenya (2:08:53). Abdi Abdirahman, a      who is based in Arizona, finished in third (2:11:23). Keitany’s unexpected break from the lead pack threw the women’s race into early upheaval as her competitors stretched out one by one along the course, jockeying for the remaining two podium spots. Sally Kipyego of Kenya, the 2012 Olympic silver medalist in the 10, 000 meters, placed second in 2:28:01, more than three and a half minutes behind Keitany, and Molly Huddle of the United States, in her marathon debut, was third in 2:28:13. Keitany’s push so early in the race seemed to wreak mental havoc on her competitors, who were forced to either try to keep up or hope that she could be caught later. “On the breakaway, I had to decide if I go or stay,” Huddle said. “I kind of went a little harder around Mile 8 and was alone for a while. Then slowed down a little bit too much on the bridge at Mile 15, and I think that just  —   I need to measure myself a little better. ” Huddle held back, but that meant Keitany’s lead would grow. Joyce Chepkirui, also from Kenya, chose to follow. But that proved fatal she was unable to sustain the pace and fell back before the halfway mark. Overtaken by Huddle, she faded to fourth. Taking off alone is a risky move, particularly early in a race, when a chase pack has more than an hour to band together in pursuit. In this case, Keitany’s strategy led to the largest margin of victory in the woman’s race  —   3 minutes 34. 98 seconds  —   since Grete Waitz won in 1980. Breakaways in this marathon are common, but early ones can ruin a   as often as they carry her to victory. Many make their moves at Mile 16 when they have safely cleared the Queensboro Bridge and are in Manhattan  —   and they are often overtaken in wild chases through the final miles of Central Park. In 2000, Abdelkhader   of Morocco ran away from the Kenyans chasing him far earlier than he was supposed to, leaving even the pacesetter behind and causing an upset. And in 1988, Steve Jones of Britain ran alone to set the fastest time in seven years, with a 3:21 margin of victory that almost rivaled Keitany’s. Meb Keflezighi, then 38, used the tactic in the 2014 Boston Marathon, when at Mile 11 he eluded a formidable field of younger athletes who figured the aging Keflezighi would fade back. Other Americans, including Ryan Hall, said they realized Keflezighi had an opportunity to win and slowed the pace of the chase pack. By the time his younger, fitter rivals realized his lead was insurmountable, it was too late. Keflezighi became the first American to win the race since 1983. Frank Shorter pulled away just beyond nine miles to take gold in the 1972 Munich Olympics. And at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, Joan Benoit Samuelson took the lead early on as well, at Mile 3 in the first Olympic women’s marathon, heading to her historic victory. “I tell people all the time, you need to run your own race,” Benoit said Sunday. “That’s what Mary did if you play into somebody else’s hands, especially early on, it can foul your plans. ” Benoit’s decision to take the lead was spontaneous. “I didn’t want to take the lead that early, but I knew what I was capable of running, and I went with it,” she said. “You’ve got to go with what you know. ” It has grown less common for women to risk taking off alone in the New York City Marathon, especially after the race switched to the separate start for the women’s professional field in 2002. In a pack, runners can take turns keeping a pace and blocking headwinds. But running together often leaves the race decided by decisive breakaways in the final miles. So if a marathoner is confident that she can maintain the pace while running alone, absorbing all of the wind, she might try to break away from the pack early to avoid a tactical sprint near the finish. In the 2011 New York City Marathon, Keitany broke away but was overtaken by two Ethiopians who steadily reeled her in. Buzunesh Deba of Ethiopia, who lives in the Bronx, ran nearly the entire course minutes ahead of the rest of the professional field with her friend and teammate Tigist Tufa through bracing wind in 2013 before Priscah Jeptoo of Kenya caught her in Central Park. Deba finished second. Keitany said she did not plan to challenge the field so assertively. But of the women on the podium, she was the only one who had completed a marathon before Sunday. Kipyego, who dropped out of this race last year, said: “I wanted to run within myself and stick to something that I felt was more conservative. I kind of came in thinking that I’d rather run a much more conservative race, hold something back, and be able to have a good experience just because this a new distance for me. ” Huddle agreed. “I was kind of just surviving at the end and looking ahead and really trying to catch Joyce and trying to catch Sally, but you were too fast,” Huddle said to Kipyego. “So just kind of flailing the last 10K probably, well, probably the last 10 miles. ” Keitany became the first woman to win New York three times in a row since Waitz won five from 1982 to 1986. As her orange sneakers bounced steadily off the pavement through the five boroughs and into Central Park, Keitany showed that she had no problem running alone  —   provided she has a chance to start at all. Although she is the   woman in history and her country’s   (2:18:37) Kenya left her off its Olympic team this year. The snub left her to focus on her fall race. She chose to execute a bold maneuver against a weak field, vacated by those who had already spent themselves at the Olympics in August or at other fall marathons. Keitany acknowledged the risk in her race strategy Sunday. “Sometimes if you break off and you’re not ready to follow through, they will catch you,” she said. “But I was ready. ”", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> Mary Keitany, a mother of two, went out for a run on Sunday morning.

{"article": "If you reflect on Adam Serwer’s dissection of the   credentials that Republicans fabricated for Senator Jeff Sessions when he was nominated to be attorney general the scathing 1986 letter that Coretta Scott King sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee, imploring them not to confirm Sessions as a federal judge due to his callous opposition to   activists the attempt Elizabeth Warren made to read King’s letter during Senate debate about whether to confirm Sessions as attorney general and the widespread anger Mitch McConnell evoked when shutting her down with a procedural rule against impugning a fellow senator then it might surprise you that Rubio, a   senator who trades on his moderate image, would make a public spectacle of standing with the GOP here. Yet the Florida lawmaker took to the Senate floor, ostentatiously defending the censoring of his Democratic colleague (albeit before the backlash) by giving a short speech in defense of rules on comity: Did he pull it off? “Turn on the news and watch these parliaments around the world where people throw chairs at each other, and punches, and ask yourself how does that make you feel about those countries?” Rubio said. “It doesn’t give you a lot of confidence about those countries. Now I’m not arguing that we’re anywhere near that here tonight, but we’re flirting with it. We’re flirting with it in this body and we are flirting with it in this country. We have become a society incapable of having debates anymore. ” He continued: In this country, if you watch the big policy debates that are going on in America, no one ever stops to say, “I think you’re wrong, I understand your point of view —  I get it. You have some valid points, but let me tell you why I think my view is better. ” I don’t hear that anymore. Here’s what I hear, almost automatically, and let me be fair, from both sides of these debates. Immediately, immediately, as soon as you offer an idea, the other side jumps and says, “The reason why you say that is because you say you don’t care about poor people, because you only care about rich people, because you’re this, or you’re that or you’re the other. ” And I’m just telling you guys, we are reaching a point in this republic where we’re not going to be able to solve the simplest of issues because everyone is putting themselves in a corner where everyone hates everybody. Rubio argued that his forbearers in the Senate “understood that that debate was impossible if in fact matters became of a personal nature,” and that “this body cannot function if people are offending one another, and that’s why those rules are in place. ” He expressed gratitude that when Hillary Clinton and John Kerry were nominated for cabinet positions, their characters were not impugned during Senate debate, even though so many partisans have such strong feelings about them. He made the case that decorum in the Senate is one of the things that makes possible the smooth functioning of an institution that is a lynchpin of American democracy. “If we lose this body’s ability to conduct debate in a dignified manner,” he concluded, “then where in this country is that going to happen? What other forum in this nation is that going to be possible?” He added: “If this body is incapable of having those debates, there will be no place in this country where those debates can occur. I think every single one of us, to our great shame, will live to regret it. ” Now, it is possible to agree that comity is important, and to applaud a reminder of its importance at a time when the nation is short on constructive disagreement, without believing that Senator Warren should have been silenced. Surely typical debate among senators —  when it is best to focus on the substance of policy and avoid attacks on people —  can be distinguished from a debate about whether one among them is morally fit to be confirmed to a position in the executive branch. Surely it is important to have a frank, fully informed debate about anyone appointed to a position as powerful as attorney general. Surely if a senator nominated to that position has done awful things, the best course is not to simply pretend they never happened or that a robust debate can occur while observing that conceit. If robust debates in those rare, unique circumstances really threaten the institution, then senators should be forced to resign before their nominations are debated. To simply subject senators to less scrutiny smacks of   corruption. At a time when faith in the legislature is low that too is a fraught course. Yet despite believing that Rubio is decisively wrong in this case —  that he could’ve found three dozen better pegs to make a case for comity and civility in our political culture —  I do hope Rubio’s general reminder about the value of comity does good. “I think what’s at stake here tonight and as we debate going forward is not simply some rule, but the ability of the most important nation on earth to debate, in a productive and respectful way, the pressing issues before us,” he said. That is an urgent concern. I also wonder if his remarks were substantially, if rather coyly, aimed at Donald Trump. “If the Senate ceases to work. .. given everything else that is going on in politics today, where you are basically allowed to say just about anything. .. ” he said. “For I have seen over the last year and half things said about people, about issues, about institutions in our republic, that I never thought I would see. Ever. Ever. ” What might “Little Marco” be referencing? That’s when I had a sudden vision of the Florida senator who promised he wouldn’t run for president again, but felt compelled to announce he would challenge Trump, or depending on events, Mike Pence, in the 2020 Republican primary, “in the hope of restoring honor to the White House, pride to the U. S. Armed Forces, and comity to the American people, who used to get along well enough to cooperate despite their disagreements. ” That’s as likely a play for the White House as any, right? If I seem cynical, I do think Rubio truly believes in conducting himself with more comity than many —  certainly more than Trump. And we all know, for all his lofty words about the body he nearly quit, that Rubio would rather be president. If Trump wins reelection, the chances that Rubio gets elected next are slim. Jeb Bush isn’t coming back in 2020. Ted Cruz has ruined any reputation he had for being principled (and if he seems like a threat, Trump can appoint him to the Supreme Court). The odds of any prediction being correct this far out are long, so I’ll put it this way: I can’t imagine Trump running unopposed for the GOP nomination, and I don’t see anyone better positioned than Rubio to run.", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> If you reflect on Adam Serwer’s dissection of the credentials that Republicans fabricated <span class=\"technique5\" id=\"row0annotation1\" technique5=\"0.60\"> for Senator Jeff Sessions when </span><sup class=\"technique5\" id=\"row0annotation1\">5</sup> he was nominated to be attorney general the scathing 1986 <span class=\"technique8\" id=\"row0annotation2\" technique8=\"0.72\"> letter that </span><sup class=\"technique8\" id=\"row0annotation2\">8</sup> Coretta Scott King sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee, imploring them not to confirm Sessions as a federal judge due to his callous opposition to activists the attempt Elizabeth Warren made to read King’s letter during Senate debate about whether to confirm Sessions as attorney general and the widespread anger Mitch McConnell evoked when <span class=\"technique5\" id=\"row0annotation3\" technique5=\"0.47\"> shutting her down with </span><sup class=\"technique5\" id=\"row0annotation3\">5</sup> a <span class=\"technique5\" id=\"row0annotation4\" technique5=\"0.52\"> procedural rule against </span><sup class=\"technique5\" id=\"row0annotation4\">5</sup> impugning a fellow senator then it might surprise you that Rubio, a senator who <span class=\"technique5\" id=\"row0annotation5\" technique5=\"0.48\"> trades </span><sup class=\"technique5\" id=\"row0annotation5\">5</sup> on his moderate <span class=\"technique9\" id=\"row0annotation6\" technique9=\"0.44\"> image, would </span><sup class=\"technique9\" id=\"row0annotation6\">9</sup> make a public spectacle of standing with the GOP here.

In effect,   they could have been accused of misleading their fans if they   didn’t note that the post was an ad. ” ’   The document also reveals the company planned for five festivals   over five years in honor of the five elements of the earth,   saying in the pitch, ”Throughout the next five years, we will   traverse the globe to find untouched lands and convert them into   unparalleled experiences.” ’ ’   This year was supposed to be  . ’ ’  ’ ”   After a few slides about the the festival’s business model, the   pitch featured slides that were likely meant to be inspirational,    are anything but.   For example, one slide simply reads: ” ’   ”WHAT IF WE REIMAGINED WHAT IT MEANS TO ATTEND A MUSIC FESTIVAL?”   over a picture of an outdoor concert. But after the festival’’s   fast   the phrase takes on a whole new meaning. ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tSo they charged 10k and this is what people got in return? ??  ! ?? Is this for real? ??  ’ ’   The next slide is just as unfortunate given the new context: ”THE   ACTUAL EXPERIENCE EXCEEDS ALL EXPECTATIONS AND IS SOMETHING   THAT’S HARD TO PUT TO WORDS,” the slide reads. Fyre     who were  for hours without food, water or shelter might have   a different take on that. ’ ’   Under ”Summary,” the slide states: ”These weekends go beyond the   beauty of a remote beach, its vast landscape and perfect waters.   The focus is on a global audience coming together in sharing a   life changing experience.” ’ ’   Beyond the beach may be correct. The fans who showed up barely   saw a beach before having to wait in a crowded airport to get a   flight home. ’ ’   Ultimately, Vanity Fair said it best when it described the pitch   deck as ”an amalgamation of a Miami Beach spa package with   selfies you might find saved on a teenager’s smartphone,” not   like something to actually invest in. ’ ’  ’ ’   Fyre Festival is now  after fans, who had spent   between $1, 200 and $100, 000 on tickets, were stranded on an   island with no festival, no shelter, and no food and water  —     until the cheese sandwiches pictured above were handed out. ’ ’ reads that the team was ”overwhelmed” by the   amount of people coming and the amount of work that had to be   done to retrofit the island for the festival. All guests this   year will be recieving a full refund, according to the website,   and VIP passes to next year’’s Fyre Festival. ’ ”   After the fiasco, the Bahamas  the festival organizers from doing further   business on the island, according to TMZ. Neither Bahamas tourism   officials nor Fyre Festival officials were immediately available   for comment.

{"article": "Kirsten Evans, executive director of  In Defense of Christians, spoke about the genocide perpetrated against Christians in the Middle East on the Good Friday edition of Breitbart News Daily. [“We’re in a critical moment, a critical situation,” she said.  Evans noted that people in the West sometimes forget “we are all sons and daughters, in some way, of Middle Eastern Christians. Christianity came to us, in the West, first and foremost through the Middle East, through the early Church. The world owes Middle Eastern Christianity for the passing on of the faith, before it became a global community and global faith. ” For this reason, she said the destruction of ancient Christian communities at the hands of Islamist forces, such as ISIS, should be a “concern to all of us, not just from a geopolitical perspective, but also from a very personal perspective  —   a personal identification with our brothers and sisters in those communities, who are living in a dire situation. ” “Without a doubt, especially with the rise of fundamentalist Islam, and in a very particular way with the rise of ISIS, we’re seeing a very targeted persecution of the Christian community in the Middle East  …     in particular in Iraq and Syria, but definitely not limited to Iraq and Syria.  Of course, we definitely all saw the tragic events in Yemen, with the Missionaries of Charity. ” This was a reference to the massacre of four nuns, plus 12 other civilians, at a retirement home in Yemen earlier this month. As host Stephen K. Bannon observed, ISIS savages murdered the nuns by tying them to trees and smashing their heads in, martyring them “just like in Second Century Rome. ” “They were targeted precisely because of their faith,” Evans agreed, “women who were just doing services, works of mercy to the community, but were targeted because of their Christian identity. ” She said the nuns lived, and died, “heroically. ” When Bannon asked where the “outrage” over genocide against Christians might be found, noting that the response from both religious and secular leaders has been strangely muted so far, Evans noted that her organization In Defense of Christians is dedicated to raising awareness of the genocide. “We’re trying to mobilize the global conscience, but first and foremost, the conscience of the Christian community  —   expand awareness, and the sense of urgency. Certainly there are people speaking out. Pope Francis has spoken about this, many religious leaders have spoken about this. We’re seeing the Christian community mobilize in aid, and in relief initiatives. ” Bannon acknowledged these responses, and the efforts conducted behind the scenes by figures such as the Pope and the Archbishop of Canterbury on behalf of Middle Eastern Christian communities under siege, but argued that the world’s response was still much too reserved in the face of “a   outright focus on the eradication of the Church,” which could change the Christian face forever by destroying “the taproot of our belief. ” Evans agreed that more needed to be done, beginning with Christians demanding a stronger response from their pastors, communities, and church leaders. “Where we feel like maybe the messaging is weak, where our pastors are silent, let’s ask them to raise their voices,” she urged. In addition to helping through her own organization and its website, InDefenseOfChristians. org, Evans suggested those interested in standing against the Christian genocide could open their own local chapters, and mobilize their communities to put pressure on political representatives, as well as making donations to groups that are providing aid to displaced Christians from the Middle East.

{"article": " When Amit Shah, president of Narendra Modi’s ruling party, meets with the Indian prime minister, he is sometimes asked a question he struggles to answer: ”What is behenji thinking?” By ”behenji” or ”older sister” Modi means Mayawati, the enigmatic politician and former ruler of India’s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh. Modi’s keen interest in what the    is up to reflects concern about his political prospects, amid an economic recovery that many poor Indians have yet to feel and rising social tensions among sizeable minority communities. With a   following from tens of millions of people who, like her, belong to the bottom rung of India’s social hierarchy, Mayawati is emerging as Modi’s chief challenger in a key state election set for early next year. ”Mayawati is the biggest threat to our victory,” Sanjeev Balyan, a federal minister in Modi’s government, told Reuters. ”The one who becomes the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh gets to be the most powerful political leader after the prime minister.” Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept Uttar Pradesh, home to 200 million people, in the 2014 general election, handing him the biggest parliamentary majority in three decades. A repeat of that success would help Modi, who remains popular among most Indians, wrest control of the federal parliament’s upper house, making it easier than it has been to pass key reforms. It would also significantly advance his chances of retaining power when India chooses its next prime minister in 2019. But violent attacks on Dalits, as those on the lowest social rung are known, are turning the opinion of some against the BJP and its Hindu nationalist supporters, giving Mayawati a new lease of life as she seeks a political renaissance. (For graphic on India’s electoral map, click  ) WHERE ARE DALIT JOBS? Mayawati is calling on minority groups to reject the BJP, whose roots are in Hindu nationalism that many Dalits and Muslims see as a threat to their way of life. ”Communal forces are becoming stronger,” she told 300, 000 cheering supporters, as she kicked off her election campaign at a sprawling park she built to honor lower caste Indians, previously known as ”untouchables” in Uttar Pradesh’s capital Lucknow. ”I want to ask the prime minister . .. where are the jobs for Dalit boys and girls?” she said. ”He will never understand the problems faced by us.” Speaking on the sidelines of the rally, Mayawati’s Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) general secretary Satish Mishra said Dalits and Muslims ”were totally unsafe” under Modi, a view that reflects Mayawati’s strategy to try and convince the two groups to vote as one. Some lower caste voters deserted her BSP in 2014, allowing the BJP to win 71 out of 80 seats. But a series of attacks on Dalits this year has   Mayawati.   hardline Hindu cow protectors have targeted Dalits and Muslims who make money skinning dead cows, accusing them of killing animals sacred to Hindus. In July, footage emerged of four lower caste men tied to a car, stripped and being flogged in Modi’s home state of Gujarat, triggering violent protests. Dressed in her trademark beige salwar kameez, Mayawati has sped across the country to appear at the side of victims. ”Mayawati has herself a godsend,” said Ramesh Dixit, a former professor of political science at Lucknow University, referring to the attacks. ”  EGOMANIAC” Born into a family of leather workers and raised in a Delhi slum, Mayawati, unmarried and her private life fiercely guarded, lives in a windowless room in a palatial house with   boundary walls and a towering statue of herself in the garden. A ”Dalit Queen” to the millions destined to a life sweeping streets or   under the Hindu caste system that defines people by job, critics have accused her of lavishing money on luxury homes and diamond necklaces while ignoring the poor. During her   term as Uttar Pradesh chief minister, she spent millions of dollars on vast memorial parks with   marble and sandstone statues of elephants, her party symbol, of Dalit icons and of herself   echoing the region’s 19th century Muslim rulers who built monuments to preserve their legacies. A U. S. diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks in 2011 described her as a ”  egomaniac” and she remains unapologetic about her personal extravagance, although officials in her party say she has since reduced the level of public pomp. Mayawati declined requests for an interview.      BJP CHIEF’S 150 VISITS Shah, one of Modi’s most trusted confidants and his chief election strategist, is betting he can expand the BJP’s appeal from its traditional base of prosperous and upper caste voters to less privileged Indians. In the past 24 months, Shah has visited Uttar Pradesh more than 150 times. Mayawati lost power in 2012 to the incumbent socialist regional party that is also expected to put up a tough fight in state elections provisionally scheduled for February. But it is Mayawati whom Modi and Shah fear most, three sources close to the men told Reuters. Dalits account for 22 percent of Uttar Pradesh’s population, and Muslims, many of whom also feel disenfranchised by Modi, the BJP and their conservative Hindu backers, another 19 percent. Modi has condemned the recent attacks, but an influential hardline Hindu organization reminded him that open criticism of cow vigilantes would send the wrong signal to his natural support base. The effort to win over Dalits gets to the heart of the dilemma facing Modi: he must placate wealthier and middle class Hindu voters while appealing to the broader electorate with a vision of a better future. SHARING A MEAL Caste remains a defining feature for people across poor and agrarian Uttar Pradesh, where India’s   economic boom has barely been felt.  No single community is numerous enough to win an election, forcing parties to widen their appeal. Starting with Shah sitting down to share a meal with a Dalit family in May, the BJP has tried to project itself as siding with the poor, even as attacks on marginalized communities capture the headlines. Shah has poached several   leaders from Mayawati and plans to reserve up to half of Uttar Pradesh’s state assembly seats for Dalits, one source close to Shah said. Modi has praised the work of Dalit hero B. R. Ambedkar, and the BJP also wants to mold new icons from that community. At this month’s annual meeting of Hindu nationalist group Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological parent of the BJP which holds considerable sway over the party, the chief guest was a member of the   Dalit street sweeping community. RISING ASPIRATIONS Not everyone from the lower castes is sure of who will best serve them. Fifty kilometres east of Lucknow, in Bedaru, villager Rampyari, illiterate and unsure of her age, is seeing the seeds of change that the BJP hopes will win votes. Upper caste Indians have begun to permit her family to attend the same temple, although not at the same time, while a gas canister will shortly replace her wooden stove under a scheme launched by Modi. Still, her support of Mayawati is unwavering, and upon hearing the name, Rampyari said: ”She has to come back. Dalits feel empowered when she is in power.” But in a central Lucknow slum, Shobha Valmiki makes $25 a month collecting waste, and feels let down by her. ”Nothing has changed,” she said, as goats and donkeys wandered down her   lane. ”They address me as scavenger, not by my own name.”  (Additional reporting by Sharat Pradhan in LUCKNOW; Writing by Tommy Wilkes; Editing by Mike  ) CARACAS   government supporters burst into Venezuela’s   congress on Wednesday, witnesses said, attacking and besieging lawmakers in the latest   of violence during a political crisis. WASHINGTON U. S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Wednesday it was important for U. S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin to have a ”good exchange” over how they see the nature of the bilateral relationship.

{"article": "   Step inside any   math class in the United States, and chances are you’ll find students staring down at their Texas Instrument calculators, nimbly typing commands into those $100 pocket computers. Calculators are so commonplace in modern American education that a   or   can be found stashed away in many homes, mementos from taking the SAT or computing integrals on the Advanced Placement calculus exam. Still, college professors remain divided on the use of calculators in their classes. When I took my freshman math courses at McGill University in Montreal last school year, I had to revert back to pencil and paper, clumsily lining up columns to do addition and   problems at my professor’s request. This isn’t an unusual predicament: According to a 2010 national survey by the Mathematical Association of America, nearly half of Calculus 1 college instructors prohibit students from using graphing calculators on exams. The debate over the use of calculators in math classrooms has ensued for more than four decades —  nearly as long as the contemporary calculator has been around. Although the abacus has been in use since the time of the Sumerians and Ancient Egyptians, it wasn’t until 1958 when the Texas Instrument engineer Jack Kilby invented the integrated circuit, which paved the way for the cheap and compact computer chips used in most electronic devices today. (Kilby later won the Nobel Prize in physics.) A decade later, calculators would no longer be stored in gigantic cabinets with a price tag of over $700, 000 they would substantially diminish in size and gradually become more affordable. Today, prices for graphing calculators hover around $80. By the mid 1970s, 11 percent of Americans owned a calculator.   calculators —  those that only perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division —  gradually entered the classrooms, dividing educators and parents alike. Debates over the role of calculators in the classroom quickly emerged, and arguments for and against their use have hardly changed since then. Proponents of the calculator argued that machines could help students make sense of abstract mathematical notations through   problems, making math fun and interesting. Opponents worried that students would become   on calculators, losing the ability to do simple arithmetic operations and exercise a solid sense of numbers. In 1986, Connecticut became the first state to mandate the use of calculators on state tests, signaling the beginning of a   generation. But the most consequential move came three years later from the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) which advocated for the use of calculators from kindergarten through grade 12. The guidelines set by the NCTM were soon adopted into many local and state curricula. In 1994, the College Board made substantial changes to the SAT’s math section to allow the use of calculators. The 1995 Advanced Placement calculus exams were the first to require the use of graphing calculators, a powerful electronic aid that is still used in most   math classes today. For W. Stephen Wilson, a math and education professor at Johns Hopkins University, using a calculator is akin to relying on a crutch when one doesn’t have a bad leg. “I have not yet encountered a mathematics concept that required technology to either teach it or assess it. The concepts and skills we teach are so fundamental that technology is not needed to either elucidate them or enhance them. There might be teachers who can figure out a way to enhance learning with the use of technology, but it’s absolutely unnecessary,” Wilson wrote in the journal Education Studies in Mathematics. Proponents of using technology in classrooms argue that graphing calculators, particularly those equipped with programs that can compute algebraic symbols, would reduce the need for students to memorize formulas and perform   computations. But Wilson fears that students who depend on technology will fail to understand the importance of mathematical algorithms. Yes, a calculator could effortlessly churn out the derivative of( )8, but would students understand how to find the answer using the fundamental theorem of calculus or the definition of the derivative? The idea, Wilson says, is not to have students mindlessly perform mechanical operations, but for students at all levels to apply linear thinking in understanding the beauty of efficient algorithms. If a student can’t master long division, how can she grasp derivatives and integrals? Wilson says he has some evidence for his claims. He gave his Calculus 3 college students a     arithmetic test (can you multiply 5. 78 by 0. 39 without pulling out your smartphone?) and divided the them into two groups: those who scored an eight or above on the test and those who didn’t. By the end of the course, Wilson compared the two groups with their performance on the final exam. Most students who scored in the top 25th percentile on the final also received an eight or above on the arithmetic test. Students at the bottom 25th percentile were twice as likely to score less than eight points on the arithmetic test, demonstrating much weaker computation skills when compared to other quartiles. It’s worth noting that calculators are also more likely to be barred in math exams at research universities than at   colleges and regional public universities. Out of the 50 national universities ranked at the top by U. S. News and World Report, only four schools had policies allowing electronic devices on Calculus 1 exams. One explanation is that selective institutions are less likely to offer remedial math courses and generally accept students who possess a strong math background. Why aren’t high schools taking their cue from math professors at Harvard and MIT? Because most college students won’t major in STEM subjects and won’t need advanced math knowledge for much of their work. Dan Kennedy, a   teacher at Baylor School, argues that to set a reasonable expectation for all students, calculators should be used because many   problems cannot be solved without technology. Students, he says, would be better served by learning probability, statistics, computer literacy, financial mathematics, and matrix algebra —  the kind of math that requires the use of graphing calculators —  not the kind of theoretical math that dominates math competitions. David Bressoud, a math professor at Macalester College in Minnesota, has a different theory: He thinks that large research universities typically ban calculators because the devices are essentially obsolete there. “The larger universities have traditionally had   resources, [and now] it is easier to expect that all students have access to a computer,” Bressoud said. Computers, Bressoud says, are a much better tool for teaching calculus because they are more flexible and faster than calculators. At Macalester,   calculus is known as “Applied Multivariable Calculus 1. ” Computers are heavily encouraged in class, and professors aren’t slowly chalking away proofs and theorems on the blackboard. Unlike those at traditional college math classes, Macalester professors take the word “applied” seriously: A lecture on functions, for example, is demonstrated using the Body Mass Index, a function of height and weight used to determine whether a person is obese. Students in their first year of calculus also learn differential equations, a topic that is generally covered only when students have three semesters’ worth of calculus under their belts. The aim is that, by introducing differential equations early on, students understand how mathematical models are generated. Why? Because these models are used in many fields, including, but not limited to, economics, environmental science, psychology, and medicine. The calculator debate also plays into a larger discussion of whether colleges should be less theoretical and more practical. For technology advocates, an increased emphasis on technology is often seen as a way to prepare students for the real world. Calculator opponents tend to see it differently. The goal of university education, they contend, is for students to get a good grasp of the theoretical foundation of a subject, not to master calculators or computers. After all, today’s technology might become drastically different 20 years from now, but a good foundation will always last. Even Socrates once quipped that a reliance on writing would lead to the deterioration of memory. And many of the best practices in pedagogy teach that memorization does have its merits when it comes to education, despite the invention of the internet and search engines. Drawing the line between the use of and barring of calculators could prove difficult, says Jon Star, an education professor at Harvard University. “That line is also moving as time goes on, at different levels. There might be students who bring different skills who put the line in different places,” Star noted. “I’m very wary of anyone who says it should be at one extreme or the other. ” Many schools opt for the middle way. While calculators might not be allowed on tests and exams, colleges know that   students will utilize programs such as Wolfram Alpha, a powerful   computational tool, to aid with calculus assignments. Homework problems often require calculator use, asking for solutions that involve cumbersome values or algebraic symbols that are too tedious to compute by hand. Will future professors who were born in a generation of smartphones and tablets change the course of this discussion? Only time will tell.", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> Step inside any math class in the United States, and chances are you’ll find students staring down at their Texas Instrument calculators, nimbly typing commands into those $100 pocket computers. Calculators are so commonplace in modern American education that a or can be found stashed away in many homes, mementos from taking the SAT or computing integrals on the Advanced Placement calculus exam. Still, college professors remain divided on the use of calculators in their classes. When I took my freshman math courses at McGill University in Montreal last school year, I had to revert back to pencil and paper, clumsily lining up columns to do addition and problems at my professor’s request. This isn’t an unusual predicament: According to a 2010 national survey by the Mathematical Association of America, nearly half of Calculus 1 college instructors prohibit students from using graphing calculators on exams.

{"article": " (CNN)  Aubameyang and his father are not only bound by blood ties. Father and son have history when it comes to the two defining moments in Gabon’s football past. Twice ”Les Panthères” have made the quarterfinals of the Africa Cup of Nations. Twice they have played out   draws before going out on penalties.  Both times, the team representing this African nation of around 1. 8 million people starred a man named Aubameyang. ”He was captain, now I’m captain, and I’m proud to lead this national team,” Borussia Dortmund striker Aubameyang tells CNN, 16 years after his father’s team lost to Tunisia.  The    knows plenty about carrying the weight of a nation’s expectations.  Gabon’s only other appearance in the last eight of the AFCON came when it   the competition with neighbor Equatorial Guinea in 2012. While it was a success on a personal level for Aubameyang    he scored three goals during the tournament    it was ultimately his miss in the penalty shootout against Mali that meant his team fell short once again. He walked back to the halfway line before collapsing to the turf in tears and, as the stadium emptied, father and son were left to reflect upon another opportunity lost. This year’s tournament offers a chance of redemption.  Gabon might only be 110th in the FIFA world rankings    below the likes of Swaziland, Rwanda and Sierra Leone    but in star man Aubameyang, it boasts one of the world’s deadliest strikers.  And, with Real Madrid legend José Antonio Camacho coaching the team, the 2017 AFCON host nation has real cause for hope.  ”I think it’s a really important challenge,” says Aubameyang. ”We have a good team . .. Why not win this trophy for the first time?” WATCH:   Aubameyang challenges Usain Bolt to a race  Like father, like son, Born in France and invited to play for Italy’s   following a spell at AC Milan, Aubameyang might never have represented Gabon at all, had it not been for the influence of his father, known during his playing days as Pierre ”Yaya” Aubame. ”It’s my culture,” shrugs the Dortmund star, reflecting on their close relationship. ”He taught me so many things about this country as captain of the national team. I lived all the time in France but it’s like I was born in Gabon. ”For me, this choice was easy because my father was my first favorite player. I was in the stadium watching him for the first time when I was maybe three years old, and straight away I knew I wanted to do it like him. That’s it.” Like his father, Aubameyang spent his formative years in French football    cutting his teeth at Dijon, Lille, Monaco and eventually   in a succession of loan deals from parent club AC Milan.  But while the career of his Dad would eventually fade into relative obscurity    comprising stints at Colombian club Atlético Junior and a season back home in his native Gabon    the same cannot be said of the Dortmund forward.  When he broke Ivory Coast midfielder Yaya Toure’s   hold on the award in 2016, Aubameyang became the first ever Gabonese player to be named African Player of the Year. His peers in Germany football voted him the Players’ Player of the Year last season after he scored 25 Bundesliga goals. And, with 16 league goals in 15 appearances so far this campaign, he’s leading the charge for the European Golden Shoe, previously won by football greats such as Gerd Muller, Marco van Basten and Cristiano Ronaldo. If Aubameyang succeeds, he will become the first ever African winner.  Already his nation’s top goalscorer and a 2016 Ballon d’Or nominee, he’s even challenged Usain Bolt to a race. It’s enough to make any father proud.  ”He told me already that he wants me to continue the way I’m going,” smiles Aubameyang, the youngest of three brothers who have all spent time on the books of AC Milan, but the only one to break into the big time.   ”I think he’s happy but every time he tells me ’You can do it better, you can do it better’ and so that’s the way.” The way forward, If Aubameyang has gone from strength to strength, can Gabon go    with Africa’s football powerhouses? First up, the hosts need to navigate a group that comprises Burkina Faso and Cameroon as well as Saturday’s opponents  . ”Every time, we get the best teams,” laments Aubameyang. ”It’s crazy! ”Cameroon are big and it will be a hard game for sure.  But we did well against Burkina Faso last year so I think we have our chances. ”It’s another year but like I said before we have a good team    young players, but talented players, so for sure we have to advance past the first round.” His father will be watching on hoping he does just that.", "sentence": {"content": "<div> (CNN) Aubameyang and his father are not only bound by blood ties.

{"article": " Uber Technologies Inc Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick quit President Donald Trump’s business advisory group on Thursday amid mounting pressure from activists and employees who oppose the administration’s immigration policies. Critics included Uber drivers, many of whom are immigrants themselves. ”Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that,” Kalanick, who had planned to attend a meeting of the group on Friday, said in an email to staff that was seen by Reuters. Uber spokeswoman Chelsea Kohler later confirmed that he had left the group. Social media campaigns had targeted Uber, urging users to delete accounts and opt for rival Lyft Inc. Uber has been emailing users who deleted their accounts to say it shares their concerns and will compensate drivers affected by the ban.  Kalanick said he spoke briefly to Trump about the immigration order ”and its issues for our community” and told the president he would not join the economic council. The CEO came under increasing pressure to leave the council after Trump issued an executive order temporarily barring people from seven   nations from entering the United States. ”There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that. The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America,” he wrote in a note to employees. ”Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there’s a growing fear the U. S. is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants.” The White House said in a statement Thursday evening that did not mention Uber that Trump ”understands the importance of an open dialogue with fellow business leaders to discuss how to best make our nation’s economy stronger.” The move could put pressure on other CEOs expected to attend a meeting with Trump on Friday. General Motors Co said its chief executive would attend, while Walt Disney Co said earlier Thursday its chief executive would not attend because of a   board meeting. Others expected to take part include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Blackstone Group LP, IBM Corp and   Stores Inc. Others that are part of the council include Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk, PepsiCo Inc CEO Indra Nooyi and Boston Consulting Group CEO Rich Lesser. Musk said he would attend the meeting. ”In tomorrow’s meeting, I and others will express our objections to the recent executive order on immigration and offer suggestions for changes to the policy,” he said in a tweet on Thursday. Kalanick’s departure could signal a growing rift between technology companies and Washington.  ”There is a battle brewing between Trump and Silicon Valley,” said Neeraj Agrawal, general partner at Battery Ventures. ”They (the Trump administration) clearly don’t value the economic activity generated by tech.” Microsoft Corp on Thursday said it proposed a modification of Trump’s travel limits. Technology companies including Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Amazon. com Inc have opposed Trump’s order, arguing that they rely on workers from around the world. Amazon and Expedia Inc have filed court documents supporting a legal challenge to the order by the Washington state attorney general.

{"article": "  Donald Trump has already committed a grave offense against our system of government by forming a “junta,” according to his critics. The Trump junta consists of three former generals whom the   has tapped for top   positions, with others still under consideration. Like much of what Trump does, the military selections have inflamed people who pride themselves on their knowledge and discernment into flights of   outrage. Namely, Trump didn’t seize the government by force he himself is not a general (although he went to the New York Military Academy for high school) and the three generals he has tapped for top posts are all retired and therefore civilians. (Michael Flynn will be   adviser, and Trump has nominated James Mattis as defense secretary, and John Kelly as   secretary.) The Trump cabinet, in other words, bears about as much resemblance to a junta as the Supreme Court does to the College of Cardinals because it has five justices who are Catholic and wear robes. To call the connection superficial is to understate how absurdly inapposite it is. If the presence of three retired military leaders is enough to tip an otherwise     government into   rule, we already experienced it at the outset of the Obama administration. As the Washington Examiner pointed out, President Barack Obama had three military leaders as part of his initial team, a retired Marine general (Jim Jones as   adviser) an Army general (Eric Shinseki at Veterans Affairs) and a Navy admiral (Dennis Blair as director of national intelligence). The republic survived. Worse, the United States has repeatedly had retired generals not merely as cabinet secretaries, but as commanders in chief  —   from George Washington, to Andrew Jackson, to U. S. Grant, to Dwight Eisenhower. No one seriously considered their presidencies affronts to the principle of civilian rule. None of this will dissuade the journalists and analysts who have been throwing around the “junta” charge, though. Much of the Left and the press has taken Trump’s election as a license to suspend rational thought. They like the delegitimizing sound of the word “junta,” and that’s enough for them to use it, never mind that it renders the term meaningless. The fact is that Trump is a civilian leader who is impressed by people who once served at the top levels of the military. This is understandable, given how the stereotype of the general as the thoughtless,   warmonger is  —   if it ever applied  —   less relevant than ever. The best generals are worldly, capable, and tend to be realistic about the limits of military power. Despite the nickname “mad dog”  —   which he dislikes  —   Gen. James Mattis is hardly Gen. Curtis LeMay, the   Air Force general who notoriously talked of bombing the North Vietnamese “back into the Stone Age” during the Vietnam War. Mattis is noted for his bookishness and traveling with a   library. More Trump Administration The Progressive BoomerangA Great Week for the Trump Administration’s Environmental and Energy PoliciesOn Immigration, GOP State Attorneys General Echo TrumpIt was important that, after his election, Trump reach outside his inner circle (Michael Flynn, for one, is firmly ensconced within it) to impressive public servants, and Mattis and John Kelly both fit the bill. They are more likely to be restraining influences rather than enablers. Trump has credited Mattis with changing his view of waterboarding, which Trump casually endorsed throughout the election campaign. If there are legitimate worries about how Trump will govern, the alleged junta is more of a commentary on his detractors than on his cabinet choices. But don’t worry.

{"article": "        For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.             Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, In recent months, a proliferation of ransomware attacks has affected everyone from   and   owners to hospitals and police departments. An attack works like this: A virus arrives and encrypts a company’s data then a message appears demanding a fee of hundreds or thousands of dollars. If the ransom is paid in time, the information is restored. “At the heart of this new business model for cybercrime is the fact that individuals and businesses, not retailers and banks, are the ones footing the bill for data breaches,” Josephine Wolff noted in The Atlantic back in June. According to an FBI tally, ransomware attacks cost their victims a total of $209 million in the first three months of 2016, a stunning surge upward from $24 million in all of 2015. However, that figure was based only on the complaints that victims reported to the bureau. In a new report, Datto, a   cybersecurity company, offers an alarmingly higher estimate that accounts for unreported incidents and lost productivity, which costs businesses far more than paying ransoms does. The company’s survey of 1, 100 IT professionals found that nearly 92 percent had clients that suffered ransomware attacks in the last year, including 40 percent whose clients had sustained at least six attacks. The report found that “less than 1 in 4 ransomware incidents are reported to the authorities. ” Factoring in the cost and average amount of time lost to infections —  an overwhelming majority of small businesses hit by ransomware face at least two days of downtime —  as well as the number of businesses affected by them, Datto suggests that the financial impact of this brand of cybercrime starts in the range of $75 billion each year. The company arrived at this figure based on an estimate from the Aberdeen Group, a consultancy, that an hour of inactivity costs small companies an average of $8, 581 per hour. By comparison, Datto’s survey indicated that about   of the IT professionals said the ransoms paid were somewhere between $100 and $2, 000. Overall, Datto estimates that $375 million has been paid out in ransoms in the past year, making lost productivity the much bigger concern. Joe Gleinser, the president of GCS Technologies, an   IT support and services company, walked me through just how   it is for companies to deal with ransomware attacks, which generally starts with the appearance of “unusually named files” or files that suddenly can’t be accessed. “Locking the network down” —  freezing some or all of a company’s systems —  is typically the first step after the attack is recognized, in an effort to stop the damage and look for fixes. “So that’s productivity hit number one,” he said. For a small business, that can mean an entire operation for a larger one, it could mean a section or a division. “Obviously in certain industries that’s a lot more painful,” Gleinser added. “In health care, that can mean patients going untreated. If you don’t have that information, you don’t know what drugs were prescribed and sometimes it’s tough to make decisions. ” Earlier this year, operations at a Los Angeles hospital came to a near halt, leaving staff to use faxes and paper notes to communicate before a $17, 000 ransom was paid. If a business has a     system in place, data may be restored with only some small delays and limited expense. Should a sufficient   not be possible and should the inaccessible files be deemed important enough, the second step is paying the ransom, a practice that the FBI discourages, but says is not illegal under most circumstances. “Paying the ransom is tricky business,” said Gleinser. “You’re dealing with criminals. ” While many ransomers operate quickly, even attentively, that is not always the case. Datto’s survey found that 7 percent of IT professionals reported incidents where data was not restored even after a ransom was paid. But even paying the ransom can be tricky. “If you don’t have Bitcoin right now, you’re probably not going to get it before the timer expires on the infection,” Gleinser said. “Many of these infections, as soon as you start the process to engage with the ransomer   …     you have about 48 hours before the data is   to encourage you to move quickly. ” As one cybersecurity company executive told Business Insider last month, banks have started to keep tens of thousands of dollars in Bitcoin ready in case of an attack. “Buying bitcoin on any one of the U. S. exchanges is a    day wait time, so we’ve been forced into the position of having to stock bitcoin as if it were computer equipment and have it ready for our use,” Gleinser added. And even if a company is prepared to pay, when the deadline arrives, the price can jump, sometime double, triple, or even quadruple, or the data can be rendered permanently unrecoverable. “We’ve seen some clients who had paid the ransom and then immediately get attacked again,” he added. So who is doing this? Ransomware attacks originate largely in Russian or Eastern European outfits, but in recent years, they’ve come from all over the world. Quoting FBI statistics, Gleinser says an average of 4, 000 ransomware episodes now take place each day, mostly with no ideological rhyme or reason. These   attacks have changed a basic business calculus whereby employers and management have started looking outward for threats instead of inward. “We’ve told clients the last 15 years, the number one threat is not the boogeyman, it’s   …     the third party you’ve already given access to your network. Disgruntled staff has by far been the largest security risk our clients have dealt with historically,” Gleinser said. “It’s not definitely true in this day and age. There definitely is a boogeyman out to get these guys. ” With Bitcoin enabling easier and less traceable methods of cybercrime, ransomware attacks will almost certainly not be the boogeyman’s final evolution. \tA bartender’s camera captures the seedy street life of retro New York.", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.

[From the Washington Post:  The first   target for the grievance movement is likely to be House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) who has drawn Trump’s wrath for not supporting him more fully. Trump’s backers, both inside the House Republican caucus and out, are already talking about a takedown. Fox News host and Trump ally Sean Hannity said in an interview after the debate that Ryan was a “saboteur” and “needed to be called out and replaced. ” Hannity said he would actively urge   conservatives to launch bids against Ryan.   …     “The revolt that has been going on in the Republican Party, that brought Trump to where he is, is not going away. If anything, it’s going to intensify,” said Patrick J. Caddell, a veteran Democratic strategist who advises Breitbart, the   website, on polling. “Republicans are living in a dream world if they think their voters are going to stop fighting the political class,” Caddell said. “What has happened will metamorphosize. The American people will not go gently into the good night of obscurity. ” At the fore of this conglomeration is Stephen K. Bannon, the former head of Breitbart who has become Trump’s most influential confidant. Bannon encouraged the candidate’s claims of voter fraud and references to a deeply corrupt global conspiracy of international banks and   politicians.   …     “What the media misses is the amount of anger that’s out there. Trump didn’t create that,” Bannon told CNN late Tuesday in a rare interview. Read the rest here.

{"article": "Industrial cleaning company Diversey has been dumped more times over the past 21 years than a   high school varsity captain. Over that span, the    Diversey has had five owners. Sealed Air on Monday became the latest dumper of the Charlotte, NC, company by agreeing to sell it to private equity firm Bain Capital for $3. 2 billion. In 2011, Sealed Air bought Diversey for $4. 3 billion from   Johnson Wax and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice. The frequent handoffs started in 1996 when Canadian beer giant Molson sold Diversey, which was losing money in the US, to European conglomerate Unilever. Six years later, its profits restored, Diversey was sold to Johnson Wax. By 2009, Johnson Wax was in financial trouble and sold off a huge stake to CD&R. “I’m not sure any of them ever got the results they wanted [from Diversey],” a former top Diversey executive told The Post. Diversey’s appeal lies in the fact that it is the   company in the industrial cleaning space. The biggest, Ecolab, generates better than 10 percent profit margins and it seems an easy model to duplicate: Sell industrial cleaning supplies for a relatively low margin, and service for a much higher margin. But those plans never bore much fruit. Gaining real market share in the US from Ecolab takes capital investment and patience, the executive said, and none of Diversey’s multiple owners had the ability or the will to make that effort. More recently, Sealed Air, whose most   brand is Bubble Wrap, thought it could package industrial cleaning supplies and the products it was already selling to the same customers. But it turns out “there are a number of channels to access customers and when you try to combine channels, you can create conflict,” the executive said. Diversey’s margins have improved greatly in the past 11 quarters, and Sealed Air believes it will have better focus if operated separately, the company said in a statement.", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> Industrial cleaning company Diversey has been dumped more times over the past 21 years than a high school varsity captain.

{"article": "New Delhi (CNN) U. S. President Barack Obama and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are pals, if you haven’t heard. The pair have ”chemistry,” according to the White House and Indian officials. They’ve shared impromptu strolls on the National Mall and, on Sunday, a long meander through a New Delhi rose garden. Indian weavers are hurriedly piecing together saris as gifts for the first lady. The normally congested Indian capital has been rid of its stray monkeys    at least in the places Obama might visit. And local television networks are running entire pieces speculating the two leaders might take a selfie. Here’s a highlight reel of social media’s favorite Obama and Modi broments so far: The hug, In case anyone doubted the deep bond between Obama and Modi (and how could they?) Air Force One’s arrival on Sunday put any questions to rest. Breaking with established protocol    and surprising television commentators on the dozen or so local news broadcasters    Modi showed up on the tarmac to be the first to greet Obama in India. And it wasn’t just with a handshake. Modi pulled the   commander in chief for the ”bear hug” seen around the world    though like most unplanned hugs in front of a   television audience, it was a little awkward. The two leaders later followed it up with another warm embrace after a joint press conference, stoking rumors of a ”bromance.” The stroll, When Modi visited Obama at the White House in September, the visit ended with Obama blowing up his    schedule and taking the visiting Prime Minister for a stroll at the Martin Luther King memorial on the National Mall. The strolling continued in New Delhi. Obama and Modi, punctuating their bilateral talks, sauntered side by side through the formal gardens at Hyderabad House, a stately 1920s home that now acts as a ceremonial venue. Cameras caught them murmuring away to each other, but reporters could not hear what they said. After the stroll they sat down for a cup of tea. Modi’s camp wasted no time posting a Facebook album of highlights. The toast, When Obama and Modi last sat down for dinner, at the White House in September, only one of them actually ate. Modi was midway through a religious fast that allowed only warm water. This time around, solid foods were consumed by all. A readout of lunch showed vegetarian and nonvegetarian menus, each with more than a dozen dishes.  (Even so, Indian celebrity chef Saransh Goila criticized its lack of variety.) Dinner was an even bigger affair: Held at the presidential palace, the event featured Indian dancers, a receiving line and, of course, a pair of heartfelt toasts. India and the U. S. share the ”natural sense of kinship” their leaders enjoy, Modi said. Obama went with a passage from Walt Whitman’s ”Passage to India”: ”The earth to be spann’d, connected by network,   The people to become brothers and sisters.”   ”Here, in our time, these words have come to pass,” Obama said. The jokes, The leaders poked fun at each other throughout the day. During a press conference, Obama remarked that Modi was greeted like a ”Bollywood star” when he visited New York’s Madison Square Garden last year. Obama also said they compared how much sleep they’re getting, prompting polite laughter from the press corps. ”And it turns out that Modi is getting even less sleep than me. But of course that’s because he’s still new. After you’ve been doing this for about six years, maybe he’ll be able to get an extra hour.” Not everyone was impressed with his answer, however. And this is just the first day of Obama’s historic visit. Stay tuned for highlights from Day Two, which has a parade on the itinerary.

{"article": "“The Legend of Tarzan” has a whole lot of fun,   things going for it  —   adventure, romance, natural landscapes, digital animals and oceans of rippling handsome  . Its sweep and easy pleasures come from its   escapades  —   it’s one long dash through the jungle by foot, train, boat and swinging vine  —   but what makes it more enjoyable than other recycled stories of this type is that the filmmakers have given Tarzan a thoughtful, imperfect makeover. That must have been tough given the origin story’s white supremacy problems. Tarzan has always had bad optics  —   white hero, black land  —   to state the excessively obvious. Probably the only real way to avoid his negative image would be to let him molder on the shelf and in our cultural memory. Except that this wild child raised by apes turned wild man forever caught between civilization and nature is a great mythic character  —   a rich, dense tangle of narrative, philosophical and political meanings. That partly explains why he’s been such a commercially reliable property since Edgar Rice Burroughs cut him loose in 1912, the year Tarzan roared into existence in a pulp magazine that evolved into an empire of books, comics, plays and films. The image of Alexander Skarsgard crashing   through the jungle as the latest   Tarzan, his long hair and   muscles gently fluttering, gets at another aspect of this character’s attraction. Like a lot of Tarzan stories, this one teems with striking flora and fauna, much of it skillfully computer generated, some of it captured on location in green, green Gabon. But its most special and spectacular effect is Tarzan, one of those characters who have always complicated the familiar argument that visual pleasure in Hollywood cinema is hinged on women being objects of male desire. Johnny Weissmuller, the most famous screen Tarzan, was an exemplary fetishized object of desire. The casting of Mr. Skarsgard, who spent a lot of time baring his body, along with vampire fangs, on the HBO show “True Blood,” indicates that the filmmakers understand a primal part of Tarzan’s allure. This isn’t strictly a question of Mr. Skarsgard’s considerable physical charms, though these are central to the character. (He isn’t playing nerd boy of the jungle.) Mr. Skarsgard is also a fine actor with an enigmatic melancholy, a quality that has been put to expressive use in small roles in movies like “What Maisie Knew” and that here suggests Tarzan carries a profound burden that makes him more complex than the usual beefcake in loincloth. And Tarzan needs a burden, something heavy enough to justify the exhumation of such a difficult fantasy figure. He gets one by proxy in “The Legend of Tarzan,” which opens with some historically informed text about King Leopold II of Belgium ( ) known as the butcher of Congo for his role in murdering millions. It’s a grim start to this   but the mood lifts at Greystoke Manor, Tarzan’s ancestral pad in Britain, where he’s broodily prowling about like a caged animal. Already married to Lady Jane (Margot Robbie, holding her own) Tarzan now goes by John Clayton, having years earlier returned to nominal civilization and its discontents. Directed by David Yates, from an     script by Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer, “The Legend of Tarzan” takes a while to get going. After announcing its grave bona fides, it continues to engage in a lot of narrative throat clearing, much of it dedicated to seeding Burroughs’s foundational story with historical facts. To this end, John receives an invitation from King Leopold to return to Congo to witness the king’s putative good works. John rejects the offer, only to change his mind after an entreaty from an American, George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) who suspects that the Belgian king is enslaving the region’s people. Mr. Jackson’s character is very loosely based on an extraordinary real historical hero named George Washington Williams, who occupies a chapter in Adam Hochschild’s magisterial book “King Leopold’s Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror and Heroism in Colonial Africa. ” Mr. Hochschild writes that Williams, whom he calls “the first heretic,” was the earliest dissenter to speak out “fully and passionately and repeatedly” on Leopold’s atrocities. Williams deserves a grand cinematic adventure of his own, and perhaps Mr. Jackson’s comfortable, affable performance, which like the movie itself oscillates between seriousness and gentle comedy, will help make that case. Here, though, Williams is basically an elevated sidekick as well as a physician, war veteran and crack shot who’s as proficient at suturing wounds with insects as he is mowing down swaths of white mercenaries. More interesting, especially given how routine colonialist fantasies tend to play out, it is Williams who voices the complexities, catastrophic errors and redemptive efforts of the   civilized world, a screen job usually given to white saviors. Williams’s polar opposite is the resident villain, Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz, predictably good) a silky, uncomplicated sadist who embodies rapacious evil from his   suit to his crosslike weapon. Tarzan remains the man apart and the man in the middle, the uneasy, sometimes forlorn, sometimes exuberant bridge between civilization and nature, between the human and nonhuman animal world. His origin story from his cradle to his new mother’s hairy arms is related in flashback patchwork that conveys what he lost when he left the jungle  —   home, world and identity. And when he at last returns to that home, he has much to do, including nuzzle old furred friends and lead a rescue mission that soon involves Jane along with thousands of Africans. Jane scoffs at the word damsel, but she’s in distress as well as a   for the abused, captive black bodies that the movie shows only glancingly. Mr. Yates, who directed the last four movies in the “Harry Potter” franchise, slips easily between intimacy and grandiosity, and he scales up and scales down as easily as Tarzan scrambles up and down the digitally rendered trees. If he and his team haven’t reinvented Tarzan it’s because they’re working in an industrial context that still puts a premium on heroic white men, even if this one doesn’t make you wince each time he turns up. Tarzan is still the white avatar flying through the African jungle with eerie skills, a mighty yodel and existential issues, yet the terrain he swings over is messier, closer and less of a lie than it once was. Part of Tarzan’s appeal  —   at least to some  —   is that he inhabits a world that resembles ours, but without the unsettling distractions of real suffering. It’s become trickier for pop entertainments to gloss over historical traumas, which may be why so many modern colonial struggles involve deep space or an alien invasion. Perhaps it’s easier to rewrite history through futuristic fictions, where worlds can collide before everyone moves on. There’s something touching about “The Legend of Tarzan,” which as it struggles to offer old   adventure without old   racism, suggests that perhaps other fantasies are possible  —   you just need some thought and Mr. Jackson. “The Legend of Tarzan” is rated   (Parents strongly cautioned). It’s a Tarzan movie!

{"article": "When Apple unleashed its homegrown Maps app with the release of iOS 6, the app was famously plagued by a seemingly endless stream of bugs, usability problems, and above all else, inaccurate mapping directions. Compounding matters was the fact that Apple Maps lacked many basic features found in competing app programs, with transit directions being a prime example. But as the years passed by, Apple Maps quietly got a lot better: mapping directions improved and Apple finally rolled out integrated transit directions with iOS 9 last year. But it’s not as if Apple Maps existed in a vacuum, which is to say that competing programs like Google Maps and Waze did not sit idly by while Apple Maps improved. As far as Apple Maps has come in recent years, many people are still beholden to Google and Waze.   Well, perhaps the time for Apple Maps to step into its own is finally upon us. With Apple introducing the world to iOS 10 at WWDC on Monday, Apple took a few short minutes to provide us with a glimpse into a completely revamped version of Apple Maps. And while we’ll have to wait and see how the app performs in the wild, the small preview we saw on Monday is extremely encouraging. In fact, Apple Maps may finally be mature enough to stand on its own against   mapping incumbents. For starters, Apple Maps in iOS 10 will introduce an   design that looks a little bit more clean and easier to follow than its predecessor. But more than that, the new version of Apple Maps promises to be a bit smarter. For instance, Apple Maps in iOS 10 will be more proactive. In an example demonstrated in the keynote, users can swipe up from the bottom, where they can easily view suggestions pertaining to travel time and upcoming calendar events. Further, Apple Maps will be able to suggest places where users can stop to get things like gas, food and coffee while en route. The new version of Apple Maps not only makes it easy to search for places like restaurants, but also makes it easy to filter search results with more granularity than ever before. Suffice it to say, the new version of Apple Maps is very  . Another   feature for Apple Maps is the ability to pan and zoom further ahead on the Map screen during   navigation. While seemingly a minor feature, this has long been a sticking point for users who weren’t quite ready to drop apps like Waze in favor of Apple’s own offering. Along with enhanced CarPlay integration, Map extensions and more automated traffic information, Apple Maps finally appears to have graduated from the minor league to the majors. As Eddy Cue boasted during Monday’s presentation, “I can find a restaurant, I can book a reservation (via OpenTable) request a car (via Uber) I can pay for it (via Apple Pay) and I can see when it will arrive, all without leaving the Map app. ” So is Apple Maps now better than Google Maps and Waze? We’re definitely not going to go that far, but at the very least, it’s fair to say that Apple Maps is finally able to compete with those two apps without being laughed out of the room.", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> When Apple unleashed its <span class=\"technique9\" id=\"row0annotation1\" technique9=\"0.52\"> homegrown Maps app </span><sup class=\"technique9\" id=\"row0annotation1\">9</sup> with the release of iOS 6, the app was famously plagued by a seemingly endless stream of bugs, usability problems, and above all else, inaccurate mapping directions.

{"article": "It is a mark of the diet industry’s brazen resilience that, in response to growing public awareness of how, for decades, it colluded with the sugar lobby to dump the blame for obesity on fat, it is scrambling to tell a new story. If you are doing dry January or Veganuary you are hopelessly behind this year, it’s all about   January, from the very people who brought you “fat will kill you   …     no, actually, it’s bread!” Well, someone has to monetise these  . Bread is still on the banned list. But thanks to all those annoyingly   books and articles last year it is no longer public enemy number one. At the top of the US bestseller list is the Whole30, a diet book devoted to eliminating, for one month, dairy and grains from your diet but throwing its weight against sugar as well. Instead, it is embracing  —   of course  —   “good fats”. What’s fascinating is the crack the Whole30 has at other food fads. On the diet’s  —   sorry, the “programme’s”  —   banned list are “    like quinoa”.  ! The cheek of it! Also tofu and tempeh. Take that, hipsters! And there’s a   at the Paleos for cheating with things such as fake  . You can’t have alcohol on the Whole30, and the sugar ban encompasses honey, maple syrup and agave. You can have ghee in place of butter and you can also have the following philosophy, which the authors call tough love but I can think of other names for: “Don’t you dare tell us this is hard,” they admonish. “Beating cancer is hard. Birthing a baby is hard. Losing a parent is hard. Drinking your coffee black. Is. Not. Hard. ” This reminds me of those actors who say acting’s not coal mining, or risking one’s life in a war, then bat their eyelashes at how hard it is to be popular. Endless studies detail how hard it is to break dietary habits, particularly when people are too busy or poor or harried to think five meals ahead and plan around a ban on every food item in the house. And while the science behind sugar addiction might be right, the same old   tactic of going cold turkey and expecting a miracle seems doomed to end in more failure. By which time something else will have surfaced to offer us salvation. Everyone in my house was sick at New Year, testing what remains of my Englishness: that is, forcing me to do something considered standard in the US that to me feels rude, which is to bug the doctor on a public holiday. This was not an emergency it was a    with a heavy cold, and a query, raised by the pharmacist, about how to calibrate the medicine. I felt terrible. Our family doctor is very nice and is always on call and it took me several goes of picking up my phone and putting it down again before I could bear to leave him a message. Then again, there is an obsequious part of my nature that likes to bother him precisely for the opportunity it furnishes to go on about how much I hate to bother him, differentiating me from all the terrible Americans on his list with different ideas about healthcare. I can’t imagine why people find the English insufferable. At about 3am I gave up trying to sleep with a barking toddler by my side and decamped with her to the sofa to watch TV. The series might have cost £100m, but two episodes of The Crown  —   the one where they spend 40 minutes discussing whether Charles should be a Mountbatten or a Windsor, and the one in which we are invited to identify with Margaret  —   had a greater sedative effect on her than anything from the pharmacist, making it, to me, this viewer, priceless.

{"article": "        For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.             Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, During Sunday night’s debate, Donald Trump told Hillary Clinton that, “if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your [email] situation. ” That would constitute an abuse of power. Presidents are not supposed to “instruct” their attorneys general to appoint a “special prosecutor” (now called an “independent counsel. ”) The attorney general is supposed to make that decision apolitically, based on her judgment of whether the Justice Department can impartially investigate the case. By pledging that she would follow the advice of the FBI investigators looking into Clinton’s email controversy, Lynch tried to disentangle legal considerations from partisan ones. By promising that he will “instruct” his attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor, Trump is pledging exactly the opposite. Why Debate Night Won’t End Trump’s Nightmare, But Trump didn’t stop there. He not only said he would make his attorney general appoint an independent counsel, he also vowed to determine the outcome of that counsel’s investigation. If he becomes president, Trump declared, Clinton will “be in jail. ” Under the Constitution, presidents don’t decide who goes to jail. (Except insofar as they have the power to pardon). Courts decide who goes to jail based on their assessment of whether someone broke the law. But Trump’s indifference to the limits on presidential power last night wasn’t surprising. He’s been advertising it since he entered the race. Last September, after National Review editor Rich Lowry said that Carly Fiorina had “cut his balls off with the precision of a surgeon” at a GOP primary debate, Trump tweeted that Lowry “should not be allowed on TV and the FCC should fine him!” Legally, there’s a debate about whether the FCC can fine broadcasters for obscene or indecent behavior. But even if it can, the Commission is supposed to do so based on objective, apolitical criteria. Trump, by contrast, was proposing to use the obscenity laws to silence his critics in the press. Doing so would transform the FCC in the same way Trump last night proposed to transform the independent counsel: from an institution tasked with impartially interpreting the law into a weapon to be used against Trump’s political adversaries. For Trump, this has been a theme. In May, angered by the “ridiculous questions” that Washington Post reporters were asking him, Trump warned that owner Jeff Bezos “is getting away with murder,  ” and “we can’t let him get away with it. ” In February, he warned that “if I become president,” Bezos and the Post are “going to have such problems. ” Put aside the irony of Trump fuming about a billionaire who is “getting away with murder,  . ” If Bezos and his company, Amazon, really aren’t paying the taxes they owe, that’s a matter for the IRS and the career prosecutors at the Department of Justice. They’re supposed to be guided by legal precedent. Trump, by contrast wants turn them —  along with the independent counsel and FCC —  into vehicles for retaliation against his critics and foes. He leveled the same threat against Gonzalo Curiel, the San Diego judge presiding over the lawsuit against Trump University. “They ought to look into Judge Curiel, because what Judge Curiel is doing is a total disgrace,” Trump declared. It’s not clear who Trump means by “they. ” There are procedures for accusing a judge of misconduct. But for a president to use those procedures to retaliate against a judge who is ruling against his financial interests would threaten the independence of the judiciary. But the very notion that there are government agencies that operate independently of presidential whim seems alien to Trump. In September, without evidence, he accused Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen of keeping interest rates low at President Obama’s instruction, even though the entire point of the Federal Reserve is to insulate monetary policy from White House meddling. In March, Trump vowed that in fighting terrorists, he’d order the U. S. military to “take out their families. ” But the military is supposed to follow the law. And the Geneva Convention, ratified by the Senate, prohibits targeting noncombatants. Nonetheless, when asked what he’d do if officers refused to carry out his illegal orders, Trump declared, “They won’t refuse. They’re not gonna refuse me. ” In September, Trump pledged that, once elected, he’d install “different generals. ” As Brian Palmer noted in Slate, that too runs afoul of our system of government. A president can recall generals from their individual commands. But he can’t simply fire them. “The president is the commander in chief of the armed forces,” Palmer explained, “not the CEO. ” Perhaps Trump’s unfettered vision of executive power stems from his particular experience as a CEO. After all, he hasn’t respected legal boundaries in that role either. Instead of keeping his charity and his   businesses separate, he’s used the former to pay the latter’s legal bills. But when CEOs don’t respect the legal limits of their power, it’s not that big a problem. It’s not that big a problem because CEOs must yield to judges because judges are agents of the state. And, at the end of the day, the state controls the guns. When a president doesn’t respect the law, it’s much dicier. By law, presidents are subject to judges too. If judges rule that a president has overstepped his legal authority they can order him to stop. The problem is that the president, unlike the CEO, can refuse to comply because he controls the guns. Or, he may control them. America has generally been spared constitutional crises that force the military to choose sides. In the course of such crises, liberal democracies often die.   What is the risk that a Trump presidency would spark such a crisis? There’s no way to quantify it. But with confidence, we can say this: It is higher than the risk posed by any other presidential candidate in modern American history. After all, even Richard Nixon, when threatened with impeachment, resigned. Republicans often say one of history’s lessons is that when a leader says he wants to kill you, you should believe him. By that logic, when a   leader says he wants to transgress the Constitution, you should believe him, too. Trump has vowed to do so many times. He did again last night. Yet most Republican politicians still look away.", "sentence": {"content": "<div> For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads. Please select the extension that is blocking ads.

{"article": "       ISTANBUL  —   They were used to stalk Russian helicopters in Afghanistan, and the United States has worked hard to keep them out of chaotic Syria. But now Kurdish guerrillas battling Turkey’s security forces may now have   missiles  —   an acquisition analysts say will seriously challenge Turkish air power and potentially intensify fighting in the region. On Saturday, media affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) a leftist militant group battling the Turkish state, posted a video purporting to show a fighter downing a Cobra attack helicopter with a     system  —   or MANPADS  —   in the mountains of southeastern Turkey on Friday morning. Arms observers said this is the first time they have seen PKK fighters successfully using MANPADS in their   fight against the Turks. About four minutes into the video, the fighter, clad in camouflage fatigues, crouches on a verdant hillside with the weapons system on his shoulder. When the launcher locks on its target  —   a helicopter whirring noisily on the horizon  —   the fighter stands to fire. The   missile swoops through the air and strikes the Cobra’s tail, sending the aircraft spinning and eventually crashing into the mountainside. Turkish authorities on Friday had attributed the helicopter crash in Hakkari province to an unknown technical failure. The chopper had been dispatched, however, after the militants staged an attack that killed six Turkish soldiers in the area. ”There have been rumors of them having MANPADS in their arsenal, but nothing concrete,” said Kyle Glen,   of Conflict News, a website that collects information and images from conflict zones around the world. ”This is the first actual video evidence of their use inside Turkey that I have seen in several years,” he said. ”Turkey will have to escalate, which means the PKK will escalate in return.   …     [It’s a] bloody cycle.” The PKK has successfully used MANPADS before, including two 1997 strikes that downed two Turkish helicopters in northern Iraq, according to Charles Lister at the Middle East Institute in Washington. ”There have been more recent alleged uses,” Lister said, ”but minimally documented.” Turkey and the PKK have been locked in conflict for more than 40 years over autonomy for the   Kurdish minority. The Turkish government has long seen the Kurds, who maintain a separate culture and speak a different language, as a threat to the ethnic purity of the Turkish state. The PKK, however, has carried out a number of bombings against both civilians and security forces throughout the conflict. Last year, a    truce between the two sides broke down, and the war reignited. Since then, PKK and other Kurdish guerrillas have killed hundreds of Turkish soldiers in clashes and other attacks, including suicide bombings. But the use of a    missile  —   which arms experts said is likely a   9K38 Igla  —   is a new and troubling development. It’s unclear where the militants, who maintain bases in both Turkey and Iraq, would have obtained the weapon system. But former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein was known to have acquired the same   system in the 1980s, as did Libyan strongman Moammar Gaddafi. The successful attack ”is a game changer” and ”could lead to further escalation in the region,” Aykan Erdemir, senior fellow at the D. C.  Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, posted on Twitter. Turkish officials did not respond to request for comment.", "sentence": {"content": "<div> ISTANBUL — They were used to stalk Russian helicopters in Afghanistan, and the United States has worked hard to keep them out of chaotic Syria.

This week, the former NBA   joined Chris Broussard on the “In The Zone” podcast and relived some of the most brutal fights he witnessed (and participated in) during his time in the association. Martin explained most actual NBA fights don’t happen when the cameras are on. It’s too easy to act tough during a game when you know someone will break things up before real punches are thrown. NBA practices are where you’ll see the most intense altercations. Martin: I’ve seen fights, been a part of fights in practice, fights in the locker room after the game.   …     My rookie year, I saw Kendall Gill choke out Jim McIlvaine in practice. Choked him out in practice one day. Jim McIlvaine was wild. He elbowed him one day in practice, elbowed him a couple times, and Kendall got fed up. Grabbed him, put him to the ground, man, and choked him, like, “I’ll kill you!” Other than myself, Nene grabbed Steve Blake by his throat one day at practice.   …     Grabbed this man by his throat and picked him up. Nene’s got them big ol’ hands, man. Picked that man up. Steve Blake was punching him. Broussard: I mean, you knocked out Nene. I’m not sure if “knocked out”   …     Martin: Yeah, it was a   .   …     They thought I broke his orbital bone. That was my first year in Denver.   …     He was starting at the time, and when I signed with Denver, we were playing open gym  —   this was before the season started.   …     So the days I would play, he wouldn’t play. He was staying away from me. And the days I wouldn’t come to the gym or I wouldn’t play, he would play. So you know me and my thought process, like, “You’re avoiding me. ” So I come to the gym late one day, and he’s playing. All right, let me guard him. I guard him, we’re going back and forth. We ain’t really playing basketball, it’s kind of getting a little chippy. Physical, I don’t mind. But I stopped play a few times, “Listen, Nene, you’re not playing basketball. Chill. ”   …     I stopped play, man. “Listen, you do it again, I’m going to punch you. Straight up. No ifs, ands, I’m going to punch you if you do it again. ” We go down, what he do? I try to box him out, he’s running with his forearm at my head. I stand him up, hit him in his chest, boom. He threw his hands up, and I turned everything into him. Hips, everything, hook. He grabbed his eye, he was bleeding, his eyeball was fluttering like it was moving. Grabbed his eye, it was bleeding, and he walked off.

{"article": " WASHINGTON  —   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley Thursday said it was unsurprising that a gun lost by U. S. federal agents had wound up in the hands of Mexican drug lord El Chapo, and warned guns from the failed “Fast and Furious” program could be in circulation for another 100 years. “It doesn’t surprise me one bit. There were about 2, 000 guns that were under Fast and Furious, and we think that there’s only been 500 of them recovered. So these guns will be around for maybe a century killing people, you know?” Grassley told BuzzFeed News Wednesday afternoon. On Wednesday the AP reported that the Justice Department had confirmed that one of the rifles seized earlier this year at El Chapo’s hideout in Los Mochis, Mexico, was one of more than 1, 400 guns that agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms lost between 2009 and 2010. Fast and Furious was a program designed to identify and arrest illegal gun runners: federal agents allowed suspects to purchase the guns in the hopes of tracing them to buyers. Instead, an estimated 2, 000 guns went missing, and most  —   but not all  —   ended up in the hands of Mexican drug cartels. In 2010, Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was killed with a Fast and Furious gun. Grassley, who had not yet been briefed on the El Chapo case, couldn’t say whether he will open new hearings into the program. But he slammed the administration’s unwillingness to cooperate with congressional investigators, who have been looking into the program. “On hearings, you know what? They haven’t even cooperated with us on the investigations we’re doing, and we’d probably have answers to a lot of these questions that we’ve asked for,” Grassley said.

{"article": "It was one of the world’s largest and most secure paedophile networks  —   an online space where tens of thousands traded horror. The website dealt in abuse video and images of children, swapped and boasted about on a   forum, accessible only through an encrypted browser. Membership was tightly managed. Quiet accounts raised suspicion and could be suddenly terminated. Those who stayed had to upload new material frequently. More than 45, 000 people complied. But what those thousands never realised, even as heavy users began to disappear, was that the site was being run by police.  For six months in 2014, inside a pale office block in the Australian city of Brisbane, an elite squad of detectives were administering the site: analysing images, monitoring conversations, connecting users with their crimes. By the time they pulled the plug on the forum 85 children had been rescued and hundreds of people across the globe arrested. Among them was Richard Huckle, a    Briton living in Malaysia, one of the board’s most prolific members. In June Huckle was sentenced to 22 life terms, one for each of the minors he was convicted of abusing.  Police believe he had at least 169 other young victims. Huckle had diligently recorded their names in a ledger, detailing the acts he had performed with each one. How he was tracked and arrested is a story of persistence, good fortune and an audacious   sting, which key figures inside the specialist police unit responsible, Taskforce Argos in Australia, have granted the Guardian access to share. The loose thread, that once pulled, would unravel Huckle’s world, leads back five years to Toronto, and the warehouse headquarters of businessman Brian Way. The    had built a   film distribution racket worth $4m, which to this day is among the largest ever discovered.  When Canadian police raided his premises they found it piled with refuse, the bathroom sheeted in thick mould. The disarray was typical of a predator’s home.  But Way, who was later convicted of 15 charges related to child abuse images and is awaiting sentencing, kept meticulous records. About a tenth of his 370 customers were based in Queensland. Their details were passed onto Insp Jon Rouse, the grave    who commands Taskforce Argos. Rouse came up through the Queensland police’s child safety group, where he investigated parents who had killed or mistreated their children, before joining Argos in 2000. “When we’re dealing with a video, when you hear children screaming, we’re listening for accents, trying to identify where that abuse is occurring,” he says. “Our job is to investigate it and end it. ” His stern mask drops momentarily recalling “the very first time I saw a video of a child being penetratively raped”. “I could not believe it,” he says. “I was so shocked. ” But to survive you need to “get past your abhorrence and horror” he says. “At the end of the day the best way to deal with this is to see it as digital evidence of the commission of a criminal offence against a child. ” After Way’s capture, dozens of arrests across Queensland followed, including of one man who subscribed to a site Argos had yet to unearth: a vast, highly organised forum, whose name is still suppressed under a strict court order. “One of the Queensland targets was a member,” Rouse says. “When we arrested him we took over his account. ” At that stage “we were just another user” Rouse says. Police discovered an intricate hierarchy operating on the site. “It ran as a company or business,” Rouse says. Senior administrators took charge of individual boards, grouped around categories such as boys or girls, hardcore or  . Users had to upload material at least every 30 days or risk exile. Each of its 45, 000 accounts were ranked according to the quality of their output, with a “producer’s area” walled off to all but the most feted. At the top was one man, “effectively the CEO”. He regularly started his messages with the cheery greeting “hiyas”. Paul Griffiths, a police officer from England with a cropped haircut and a hard stare, worked on Argos in Queensland as a victim identification specialist, scanning gigabytes of images and videos each week looking for clues  —   a brand of food, a grain of wood  —   that might give away a child’s location. Above his desk was a whiteboard scrawled with two dozen usernames: the forum’s most wanted. Huckle’s name made the whiteboard because he was a producer, uploading exclusively fresh material. He was zealous about it. “He belittled others [on the forum] for claiming they were paedophiles,” Griffiths recalls. “He thought they were just sitting at home living off other people’s experiences, where he was out there living the life. ” “[Huckle] talked about leaving a legacy, where he’d be remembered because of the material he produced,” Griffiths says. “He got to the point where he was actually titling his work, saying it was his studio. He was definitely branding. ” To Huckle’s frustration, however, his material was not sought after. “You’ve got the fact he wasn’t particularly popular, he was very arrogant,” Griffiths says.  Huckle took precautions, usually blurring faces and backgrounds, and erasing telltale metadata from his work. Advice, including on how to evade police detection, was readily available on the site. One   manual billed itself as “the exclusive step by step guide for practicing safe and fun sex with children”. Huckle had authored his own   tome, titled “Paedophiles and Poverty: Child Lover Guide”.  In Brisbane, police laboured over the word “hiyas” the word use by the site’s de facto CEO. “It didn’t really look like something that I’d use, or that anyone I know would use in conversation,” Griffiths says. When he punched it into Google, it returned thousands of hits. “All the people I could see using it as a greeting were women. ” Danish authorities had already supplied Argos thin leads that the site’s kingpin was somewhere in Australia, probably Adelaide. Some of the children in the work he produced were clearly Indigenous. In one of his images, a small girl was splayed on a bed, a sheet of paper beside her reading, “Aussie”. A web search for “hiyas” turns up more than 450, 000 results. The odds against police in these investigations are stacked extraordinarily high. What improves them is a basic truth about the people they hunt. “They will make mistakes,” Griffiths says. The man behind the site made at least three, that in time, would lead police crashing through his door. A man was discovered using the giveaway greeting on a   drive discussion forum. He lived in Adelaide. Griffiths’ eyes went wide at his username. It was a close copy of the handle used by the forum’s chief. Another similarly named user  —   liberally sprinkling his posts with “hiyas”  —   was also discovered on a basketball forum. “And I thought, this is just spooky. It’s just too much of a coincidence not to be him,” Griffiths says. The user on the   drive forum had asked for advice on raising his car’s suspension. People had replied suggesting parts. “I actually found someone on Facebook who was trying to source those parts [the user] had been advised to use,” Griffiths recalls.  It was a    named Shannon McCoole. He worked in childcare. “Suddenly it all fell into place,” Griffiths says. “It was a battle stations moment. ” Police moved on McCoole in June 2014. Though news of his arrest was initially suppressed, the fact he worked in state care would eventually trigger a royal commission. It revealed a long trail of red flags raised by McCoole’s colleagues over the four years he spent volunteering for youth services and and eventually working for Families South Australia. They included an anonymous call in March 2011 warning authorities the   was inappropriately physical with some children. It was ignored, along with a psychological assessment one year later, that found him to be “high risk” and “very unsuitable” for the job. Considering these misses elicits the rarest flash of emotion from Rouse. “Looking at the timeline, it’s quite horrendous,” he says. “It’s sickening. But it’s history now. ” McCoole was jailed to face court, but online, his presence barely faltered. Two officers had immediately assumed control of his account. This was in a different league from the earlier takeover of a Queensland account. Now one of the world’s largest online paedophile networks was suddenly being run from the Brisbane headquarters of the Queensland police. In Greek myth, Argos Panoptes was a giant who served as a guard for the queen of the gods, Hera. The beast had one hundred eyes, never closing all at once. “Ever vigilant,” Rouse says.  For six months in 2014 Task Force Argos was   too, with access as McCoole to the forum’s every crevice, and the private messages of all 45, 000 users. Including Richard Huckle’s. His messages provided early clues the man from Kent might not be preying on children in south Asia after all. He had still been careful never to name a country. But to a paedophile based in the Philippines who wrote to him, “pity you’re so far away,” he had replied, “I’m probably closer than you think”. As well, there was intelligence suggesting the offender had spent time in Malaysia. Access to the full suite of Huckle’s material provided the breakthrough. It was not what he photographed, but what he photographed with. Embedded in some of his images, overlooked when he swept the files of metadata, was the brand and model of his Olympus camera. A tiny clue  —   but enough.  Officers exhaustively swept photography sites such as Flickr and TrekEarth for photos taken in   Asia using the make and model. Sure enough, “we find some perfectly legal images from Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, taken with the same make and model of camera”. The photographer also had a penchant for shooting children, sometimes naked, “but nothing illegal in them” he says.  Police traced the legitimate photographs to an email address, which in turn illuminated his accounts on other websites. In an echo of McCoole’s case, one of these accounts was registered under a similar name to that of a paedophile on their site. “And realistically by that stage it was no chance he would be anyone else,” Griffiths says. The digital trail also led to a studio named Huckool Photography Productions. It was based in Malaysia and linked to Huckle’s public Facebook profile. There, he had been more brazen than police could have imagined. “On his photos on Facebook there were photos of similar children, and the same children, that appeared in the abuse material that he published online,” Griffiths says. Some of Huckle’s profiles are still archived. They are a sea of children: in church, dressed as Christmas angels   in water, beaming bunched together, “delightedly   [at] their English photographing uncle” he writes. Some show more brooding glances, and you wonder. Griffiths, who had worked as a police officer in his home city of Manchester, called his counterparts at Britain’s National Crime Agency (NCA) passing on the raw intelligence about Huckle’s crimes and his likely identity. But Huckle would remain in Malaysia untouched for another four months. “As I understand it, the Malaysians believed they didn’t have enough evidence to arrest him,” Griffiths says. (Malaysian police say they were only notified of Huckle’s offending by the NCA in May 2016.) They were so close. Police had an identity, a location, an array of online profiles. But no way to way to reach the man himself. Until Huckle provided one. “I just saw a [Facebook] post he made, basically saying, ‘Great news, I’ve just booked a flight home for Christmas’,” Griffiths says. “He had hashtagged the airline. It was almost too easy. ” Huckle was arrested at Gatwick airport on 19 December 2014. Computers and hard drives in his possession contained more than 20, 000 indecent images of children, around 1, 000 depicting children he had himself abused. To this day he has refused to divulge the keys to encrypted files on his laptop, thought to reveal additional victims, and thousands more images and videos.  Huckle’s trial received sensational media coverage in the UK, including his branding as “Britain’s   paedophile”.  Around the time Huckle was arrested in December 2014, undercover police posted a message from Shannon McCoole’s account to the forum. “[Forum name redacted] is a living creature,” it said. “We have survived a lot of ups and downs. It’s been a passion of mine for a long time, and [forum name redacted] is bigger than ever. “Believe it or not, the board doesn’t run itself and requires a lot of thankless hours from the admins,   and mods. So the board will go into maintenance mode till the new year to give the admin team time to a break. “[It] will return in 2015 refreshed and better than ever. ” After six months running the forum  —   gathering enough evidence to prosecute hundreds and rescue 85 victims  —   police were pulling the plug on site. For months before, as evidence was disseminated around the world, the most significant users were being picked off by police. “Some of [the users] put it together before we closed the board,” Griffiths recalls. “People noticed people were disappearing. It’s an occupational hazard, and they usually assume when someone disappears they’ve been arrested. But when it keeps happening and happening, they start putting two and two together. ” Users even began approaching McCoole’s account with worries the police had infiltrated the site. Once they realised the forum wasn’t returning, and news finally emerged of McCoole’s arrest, some even offered grudging compliments. “One guy posted something along the lines of, ‘Kudos. I chatted to McCoole for six months and didn’t realise it was the cops’,” Griffiths says. Two Argos officers received awards for so seamlessly assuming McCoole’s identity for six months on the board. Last month, Richard Huckle was sentenced to a minimum 23 years’ jail. Shannon McCoole is serving 35 years. A blue line has been struck through both their names on the   list above Griffiths’ desk. More than two dozen others were crossed off the whiteboard by the time that particular investigation was closed.

{"article": "Maine Democratic elector David Bright announced Monday morning that he would vote for Senator Bernie Sanders in the Electoral College. He told the Portland   that his vote would send a meaningful message to the thousands of new voters who enrolled as Democrats to support Sanders. Is it the job of an elector to send a reassuring or encouraging message to discouraged activists? More than 354, 000 Maine voters cast ballots for Hillary Clinton, with the full expectation that Democratic electors would give her their votes if she won the state and its electoral districts. Don’t they deserve some encouragement, too? Just what kind of a message will they hear when they learn that Bright decided to ignore their ballots and vote for Sanders? As Samuel Goldwyn said, “If you have a message, call Western Union. ” The Constitution and federal law give the states a lot of latitude on selecting electors. But there’s a reason those electors who violate their pledge are called “faithless,” their names and number recorded in history: The system works only if voters have confidence that their ballots will matter, and voters can have confidence that their ballots will matter only if electors remain faithful. The prospect of a Trump presidency has triggered other electors to violate their pledges, or contemplate doing so, as well. Two of Satiacum’s fellow Washington Democratic electors, Bret Chiafalo and Levi Guerra, announced an interest in voting for a Republican alternative to Trump. Three Democratic electors in Colorado filed an emergency request to suspend a state law that requires electors to vote for the candidate who won the state. A federal appeals court denied the request. (One of the great ironies of the brouhaha about “faithless electors” this year is that Hillary Clinton may lose more votes than Trump does more Democratic electors than Republican ones have expressed a public interest in voting for someone besides her.) For the last week, American politics has been entirely preoccupied with the apparent fact that Russian hackers, under orders from the Kremlin, engaged in a criminal campaign to undermine public faith in America’s system of elections and possibly to help Trump win the White House. Just what will happen when those such as Sanders and Kasich, who didn’t win their parties’ nominations and weren’t even on the ballot, get electoral votes because they’re more appealing to individual electors? How much faith do   Maine Democrats have in the system right now? Our elections run on trust. These faithless electors have publicly pledged to support a nominee and in some cases signed written pledges. Once the election results were in and it was too late for them to be removed from their positions as electors, they announced that they intended to vote for someone different. If this phenomenon becomes more common every four years, people will justifiably ask whether their vote matters at all. There will be efforts to increase the punishment of faithless electors, but that’s an    consequence unlikely to deter someone sufficiently narcissistic that he takes relish in ignoring the will of their states’ voters. Can we imagine a scenario in which a   proves so spectacularly unqualified and dangerous to the Republic that the electors need to save the American electorate from its own bad judgment? Sure. But that sort of extraordinary measure ought to be reserved for extraordinary circumstances, not just a temper tantrum over the Clinton campaign’s hubris that the upper Midwest was solidly blue. Our system of democracy offers almost unlimited opportunities to speak one’s mind and “send a message. ” Why must these electors turn the Electoral College process into one more soapbox? More Electoral CollegeAmerica’s CollegeWhat Trump calls Schumer, c. The Culinary CultMany Democrats have grumbled about the Electoral College ever since the 2000 election but lament that passing a constitutional amendment is just too hard. This year’s faithless electors may do some of the heavy lifting for them. Voters won’t long tolerate a system in which   efforts to win the most votes in a state are undone retroactively because unknown party activists have a personal change of heart or want to send a message. The Electoral College is a wise concept, designed to ensure that each state has value in the election and save the country from the nightmare scenario of a   margin triggering a nationwide recount. But it works only if everyone involved acts with integrity, including the electors. It’s easier to trust 538 fellow citizens if they keep their word or resign when they feel they cannot keep it in good conscience, as one   Texas elector did. But if enough members of that group of 538 are narcissists who get a thrill from defying the public’s will, public faith in American elections will crumble, and it won’t be the fault of Vladimir Putin’s thugs.,", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> Maine Democratic elector David Bright announced Monday morning that he would vote for Senator Bernie Sanders in the Electoral College.

{"article": "This past Thursday, we lost a true hero, John Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth. With his death, none of the first Americans to go into space are any longer with us. His bravery  —   as a Marine aviator in World War II and Korea, and as a test pilot in the 1950s, when he attended colleagues’ funerals on an almost weekly basis  —   had been well established before he climbed into the Mercury capsule that sent him into space in 1962. So he was willing to ride on top of an Atlas rocket which, in its   form, had a significant chance of failing. His odds were somewhat better than that, because his rocket had been “man rated,” with   parts, additional redundancy, more thorough inspections, and a   structure. (It also had a   system to pull the capsule rapidly away if something went wrong with the vehicle.) In the end the rocket performed fine, and he suffered no obvious ill effects from the experience, surviving to enter the history books. But it’s worth remembering why he was willing to risk his life on a space flight in the first place. In 1962, at the height of the Cold War, space was important and worthy of such risk. We were going to the moon to demonstrate our technological superiority to the Soviets and the world, and Glenn’s flight was a crucial milestone on that path. SLIDESHOW: Astronaut John Glenn, Two weeks ago, there was a failure of a Russian Soyuz rocket delivering supplies to the International Space Station in a Progress cargo ship. After separation from the lower stages, the third stage of the rocket, needed to provide the final delivery to orbit, didn’t complete its burn  —   it seems in fact to have exploded  —   and the ship fell out of the sky, its pieces scattering in southern Siberia. The loss didn’t create an emergency at the station, which has sufficient supplies to last months  —   more than long enough for another cargo mission to arrive, whether with Soyuz or another entity, such as SpaceX or Orbital ATK. (In fact, a Japanese cargo flight went up a few days ago). But it highlighted a bigger problem: While we have a number of ways to get cargo to the station, since the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011, the Russian Soyuz is our only way of getting crew up and back. And the stage that failed two weeks ago is the same stage used to get the Soyuz crew module into orbit. We don’t yet know why the stage failed. It’s flown successfully many times, so it’s unlikely to be an intrinsic design flaw. It could be due to sloppy procedures, or a faulty component, as a consequence of the general deterioration of the Russian space industry amid corruption and turf wars. While it’s not the first time this stage design has failed, there has been no such failure with crew aboard. Whether it’s because officials take greater precautions with crewed flights or simply because of dumb luck is also not known. But either way, while NASA hasn’t yet made a big deal out of it publicly, until they understand the cause, they can’t trust the rocket to get its astronauts to the ISS, and they won’t be able to rotate crews. Why do we currently have only one means to get to the International Space Station? And why are we unwilling to risk an astronaut’s life on it when it has had a failure? Why is it that, over half a century after John Glenn’s famous flight, our mantra has gone from “Beat the Soviets to the moon” to “Safety is the highest priority,” a phrase used repeatedly in Congressional hearings? In my book a few years ago, I argued that it is because space is no longer important enough to justify the risk of human lives, at least with taxpayer funds. And that when safety is the highest priority, actually accomplishing things in space becomes a lower one by definition. “Safety is the highest priority” is the reason that we don’t have a replacement for the Shuttle, in terms of our ability to get our astronauts into space on American vehicles. NASA has long had a Commercial Crew program to do so, with two providers, SpaceX and Boeing, and it was originally supposed to have been operational by now. But it has been delayed for years, both because of penny pinching by a Congress more eager to fund an unneeded, overpriced rocket and capsule that will rarely fly and because NASA must follow the “safety first” mantra  —   with extensive program reviews, milestones, and inspections  —   to ensure that we don’t lose an astronaut. Which is ironic, considering that NASA has much more insight into the new commercial systems than it’s ever gotten from the Russians on whom it has relied for half a decade. The SpaceX Dragon pressurized capsule was first launched and recovered almost exactly six years before Glenn’s death and the   Soyuz failure, and at the time, company founder Elon Musk said that if someone had been aboard “they’d have had a very nice ride. ”   of safety for the company, NASA astronaut Ken Bowersox, told me that all he’d have needed was a “scuba tank, a regulator, and a beanbag chair. ” But today, the first flight of a crewed Dragon on a SpaceX Falcon 9 has been delayed until   and the first flight of Boeing’s “Starliner” capsule will happen even later than that. Because today, “safety,” not getting Americans into space on American rockets, is “the highest priority. ” If he chooses to, this is one of the things that   Trump can “make great again. ” But it will require a major change in attitude and policy direction, and some of his finalists for NASA administrator provide grave cause for concern. More NASA This Time, Not for Prestige: The Space Race in the 21st Century‘Godspeed, John Glenn’Let Newt Gingrich Fix NASAIn particular, Mike Griffin, who served as administrator under George W. Bush, would be a terrible choice. The last time Dr. Griffin ran NASA, the agency maintained a cozy relationship with the private contractors it employed, a revolving door of the sort that Trump and those in his orbit have lately railed against. Partly as a result, Griffin left his successor a programmatic mess, and while it would be ironic if he became administrator again and   that same mess, the best way for Trump to honor the memory of John Glenn (who late in his life saw private spaceflight as the future) would be to pick a fresh face, with a fresh approach not tainted by the failed ideology of Apolloism. NASA needs a leader who is willing to tell Congress that our space future lies not with giant rockets, but with commercially affordable ones, and that when it comes to spaceflight, safe is not an option. A leader who understands that the acceptance of risk is necessary to show that American spaceflight matters, as it used to. A leader, that is, with the courage and vision of Glenn himself.,", "sentence": {"content": "<div> This past Thursday, we lost a true hero, John Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth.

{"article": "     It has become as routine as inclement weather: Another horrible mass killing happens in our country and Congress does nothing. It doesn’t even simply do nothing. It actively votes down even the most modest efforts to save at least a few lives and to make killing a little less likely the next time around. Another day, another dead gun control measure. And the media treats the event accordingly. This struck me today when I looked at my morning newspapers. (I love the online world, but still like to read print newspapers, which might simply mean I am of a certain age.) The Post story on the Senate’s shameful cave to the gun lobby ran in the middle of Page A4 under the headline “4   proposals fail to advance in the Senate. ” The New York Times ran its account at the bottom of Page A12, with a similar headline. The Wall Street Journal ran its account at the bottom of Page A3. I get the news judgment here: Big news would have been something happening. Still, I would have liked at least one of the papers to put the gun   on its front page, on the theory that what we do about gun violence is at least as important to us as the firing of Donald Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, about which the media went absolutely gaga. But there is something else: What happened this week will be marked over the long run as the beginning of the end of gun lobby dominance. First, advocates of   gun measures  —   I use the PR term we gun controllers have decided upon because I believe it’s accurate  —   put up a fight of a sort we have not seen before.    The Senate voted down four measures Monday evening relating to gun measures after hearing debate from both Republican and Democratic senators. The vote comes one week after a gunman opened fire in an Orlando nightclub, killing 49 people before being killed by police. (Reuters)   The filibuster mounted by Sen. Chris Murphy ( .) joined by Sen. Cory Booker ( . J.) and others, marked a sea change. Typically, advocates of doing something spent weeks and weeks trying to negotiate some package that just might draw this or that timid senator away from his or her absolute fear of the gun lobby. The   measure would be defeated anyway. This time, the advocates of an assault weapons ban and     legislation said: Enough. We want a vote on the actual bills we would like to see passed. If our opponents want to demonstrate that they would rather kowtow to the National Rifle Association than do something about potential terrorists getting guns, go ahead. Make our day. Let your constituents know that when push comes to shove, you do not mean a single word you say about the urgency of fighting terrorism. If the NRA says it’s better to risk terrorists getting guns than to make any change in the law, let’s see how many senators  —   almost all of them Republicans  —   will go with the NRA. And see you in November when the voters have a say. You could see the defensiveness on the part of senators who always bow before the gun lobby. “No one wants terrorists to be able to buy guns or explosives,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( . ). Oh really? Then why not vote that way? That McConnell said this shows the extent to which the terrorism issue has called the gun extremists’ bluff. There is even talk that something might actually happen. Sen. Susan Collins ( ) is trying to muster 60 votes for a compromise measure that would keep guns out of the hands of a much smaller number of suspected terrorists than would have been covered under the amendment proposed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( .) that was voted down. It’s important to see what is happening here. In a normal compromise, people who feel strongly on one side reach agreement with people who feel strongly on the other. In this case, the gun lobby’s position is so extreme that “compromise” means a rather paltry piece of legislation. Nonetheless, that Collins is getting some support from her fellow Republicans hints they may be genuinely worried that voting against the views of an overwhelming majority of Americans could carry a real political price. I thought that Lawrence O’Donnell, a host for MSNBC (where I do some work) and a former staffer to Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, had it right Monday night about the trajectory of this issue. He pointed out that supporters of reform must often absorb the heat after defeat before they achieve victory. This has been true of many of our most important reforms, from the creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority to the securing of labor rights under the Wagner Act to the advances in health care represented by Medicare and Obamacare. A Pyrrhic victory is a triumph “achieved at too great a cost. ” The gun lobby’s victories Monday fit that classic definition. The tide will turn.", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> It has become as routine as inclement weather: Another horrible mass killing happens in our country and Congress does nothing.

{"article": "The corporate owner of Sears and Kmart said on Tuesday that there was “substantial doubt” that it could continue operating, as    stores continue to face challenges in an   world. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the corporate owner, Sears Holdings Corporation, cited its efforts to cut costs, sell property, tap new funding sources and make other moves to stanch the flow of red ink. Still, it reported a $2. 2 billion loss for last year and said it had to use money from its investments and financing activities to fund operations. “Our historical operating results indicate substantial doubt exists related to the company’s ability to continue as a going concern,” it said in the filing, its annual report. The disclosure is a setback for the company and for Edward S. Lampert, the hedge fund manager who engineered the combination of the two legends of American retail 13 years ago. Mr. Lampert has shut down stores, reshuffled the company’s organization and pushed to have a greater online presence. Still, Sears Holdings has lost more than $5 billion over the last three years as sales have declined. On Wednesday morning, in the first day of trading after the disclosure, shares in the company tumbled more than 13 percent. Sears, through its catalog, has been a fixture of American homes for more than a century. Kmart, which has its own lengthy history beginning as a    store in Detroit, became a major national presence in the 1960s as a   department store, with Blue Light Special discounts geared toward     Americans. But both brands were squeezed by Walmart Stores, with its heavy discounts, and Target, which sold affordable goods but with more design and flair. Both Sears and Kmart also suffered because they were in older shopping malls and neighborhoods. Online retailing, with the rise of the likes of Amazon, presented a more recent challenge. To cope, Sears Holdings has been shrinking. This month, it sold its Craftsman tool brand to Stanley Black  Decker in a deal valued at more than $775 million. Still, its   debt as of January totaled nearly $4. 2 billion, almost double from the same period the previous year, according to the filing. In February, Sears Holdings said it had started a restructuring program that it said would save $1 billion annually. The plan focuses on streamlining   corporate and support functions, tweaking product offerings and supply chain and looking for ways to reshuffle real estate. As of January, Sears Holdings said, it had 1, 430 Sears and Kmart stores in the United States. By contrast, a decade ago it had about 3, 800 stores in the United States and Canada.", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> The corporate owner of Sears and Kmart said on Tuesday that there was “substantial <span class=\"technique5\" id=\"row0annotation1\" technique5=\"0.54\"> doubt” </span><sup class=\"technique5\" id=\"row0annotation1\">5</sup> that it could continue operating, as stores continue to face challenges in an world.

Please follow the steps below, It s the end of the month, which means The Atlantic s Business section editors have once again compiled a list of the best things they ve read (or listened to) in the past few weeks. Among other topics, this month picks include a look at why Americans have reacted so deeply to Marie Kondo s cleaning philosophy, whether or not Hillary can satisfy devotees to Bernie s economic plan, and a deep dive into the unsolved murder of a banker in Puerto Rico. If you ve missed a recent roundup, you can find them here, here, and here.  Food Fight ? Malcolm Gladwell | Revisionist History, Bowdoin College in Maine and Vassar College in upstate New York are roughly the same size. They compete for the same students. Both have long traditions of academic excellence. But one of those schools is trying hard to close the gap between rich and poor in American society ”and paying a high price for its effort. The other is making that problem worse ”and reaping rewards as a result.  Food Fight, ? the second of the   Revisionist History miniseries on opening up college to poor kids, focuses on a seemingly unlikely target: how the food each school serves in its cafeteria can improve or distort the educational system. * * *  Marie Kondo and the Ruthless War on Stuff ? Taffy   | The New York Times, People had an unnaturally strong reaction to the arrival of this woman and her promises of   magic. There were people who had been doing home organizing for years by then, and they sniffed at her severe methods. (One professional American organizer sent me a picture of a copy of Kondo s book, annotated with green sticky notes marking where she approved of the advice and pink ones where she disapproved. The green numbered 16 the pink numbered more than 50). But then there were the women who knew that Kondo was speaking directly to them. They called themselves Konverts, and they say their lives have truly changed as a result of using her decluttering methods: They could see their way out of the stuff by aiming upward. * * *  Demand Curve ? Brooke Unger | 1843, So why does HermÃ¨s starve the market for Birkins, when it could sell many more, and so make much more money? HermÃ¨s says that the constraint is the availability of   skins and people qualified to work with them. HermÃ¨s s   division (mÃ©tier, in company parlance) hires 200 craftspeople a year and takes two years to train them. The limit on the number of bags that can be made is therefore a natural one. Like gold and Bitcoins, HermÃ¨s suggests, Birkins are mined, not simply made. * * *  Fences: A Brexit Diary ? Zadie Smith | New York Review of Books, What have you done, Boris? What have you done, Dave? Yet within this tale of our solipsistic leaders, thoughtlessly lighting a fuse, there is contained a less pleasing story of our own Londoncentric solipsism, which seems to me equally real, and has formed a different kind of veil, perhaps just as hard to see through as the blinding personal ambition of a man like Boris. The profound shock I felt at the result ”and which so many other Londoners seem to have experienced ”suggests at the very least that we must have been living behind a kind of veil, unable to see our own country for what it has become. * * *  Could Hillary Become the Champion of the 99 Percent? ? Gideon   | New York Times Magazine, Much of the left, including the significant bloc that rejected Clinton in the primaries in favor of Bernie Sanders and his call for  revolution, ? finds Wong and her allies delusional in their hope that  Rewriting the Rules ? might be realized in Democratic Party practice. But the Sanders and Trump insurrections revealed an appetite for economic populism that no one in either party establishment had quite anticipated. Now Roosevelt and other progressive groups are wagering that a mandate for economic overhaul might already exist, and that it might even be carried out by the woman who always was the party s   nominee. Wong herself believes that the financial crisis radically destabilized the politics of the American economy, possibly for decades to come, and that 2016 might well mark the early commotion of a genuine political realignment. * * *  The Strange Story of a Murdered Banker in Puerto Rico ? Today, almost everyone in San Juan banking circles has a theory about the murder. Some believe only Colombian hit men could pull off such an assassination. Others say Spagnoletti had enemies in the U. S. who caught up with him. His widow, Marisa, revealed her own theory in a 2013 lawsuit: She said he was killed because he uncovered fraud at the bank and fired an executive he suspected of embezzlement. Doral s lawyers called her claims ridiculous, and after Marisa admitted in a deposition that she had no evidence, she withdrew the suit. Since then, new details of the killing have emerged. And according to former Doral executives and people working on the criminal investigation, the widow was onto something.  Let s use our common sense for a second, ? says MarÃ a DomÃ nguez, who was in charge of an investigation into Doral as first assistant U. S. attorney in San Juan until she retired last year.  This guy was brought by the bank to put the house in order. He starts uncovering certain things that are irregular at the bank. He starts to take corrective action. These circumstances strongly suggest a financial motive to get this guy out of the way. ? * * *  Why Your Company Needs More Ceremonies ? Patti Sanchez | Harvard Business Review, We often use ceremonies to celebrate good things: big promotions, business victories, and so on. But they can be just as powerful when used to acknowledge difficulties, mark dark passages, and help those affected by change move on. It s important to take a moment in difficult times to communally honor those who have made sacrifices or experienced hardship in the course of change. Sometimes, a dose of levity can help. As part of his effort to get developers at Apple to transition from Mac OS 9 to Mac OS X, Steve Jobs held a mock funeral at the 2002 Worldwide Developers Conference. With sad music playing in the background, Jobs placed a large box labeled  Mac OS 9 ? into a coffin on stage and then delivered a eulogy for the operating system that had been  a friend to us all. ? * * *  The Loneliness of Being Black in San Francisco ? Thomas Fuller | The New York Times,  You get the feeling that people are thinking,  You re still here?  ? said Barbara Gainer, a probation officer and a jazz singer. She lives in the western reaches of the city, a neighborhood that was once predominantly black but now is mostly   a segment that now makes up 34 percent of the city s population, up from 13 percent in 1970. Ms. Gainer says she is regularly asked if she wants to sell her house her mailbox fills up with solicitations. The inquiries were flattering at first because they reminded her of the value of her property, but now she feels singled out. She remembers one couple in particular who approached her four or five times about selling. She tried to dissuade them.  I said:  Even if I sold you my house and you gave me this big price, why would I do that? Where would I live?  ? The reply stunned her:  You should go to Antioch. That s where your people go. ? * * *  The   Barista ? Jody Hoff | Stitcher, Imagine your morning coffee run: You walk in, you put in the order, Â say hi to the cashier, then you pay. After a few minutes your name is called, you pick up your latte or espresso and then you re out the door. But did you ever stop and think about that person behind the counter making your coffee? How did they end up there? ", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.

{"article": " BAGHDAD, Iraq  —   Soldiers cheered and honked the horns of their Humvees as their convoy rolled north on the highway out of Baghdad. One filmed the procession on his phone to mark the event: The Iraqi military was getting ready to return to Mosul. “I’m higher than the palm trees,” another soldier said. The Iraqi military surrendered Mosul to ISIS in June 2014, leaving behind their   weapons and setting the stage for the declaration of ISIS’s caliphate. Now the same Iraqi military, reinforced with more than two years of US training and aid, is beginning a massive offensive to win Mosul back. Kurdish forces could initiate attacks on outlying villages as part of the offensive as early as this weekend  —   and Iraqi troops, who will be the primary force in the offensive, will follow suit either in unison or shortly afterward. The stakes for all sides are high. For ISIS, Mosul is the most populous and important city it holds. It was the first modern terrorist group to control its own state  —   and losing Mosul would set the stage for that state’s demise. For the Iraqi government, retaking Mosul is crucial to rebuilding the country. And the Mosul offensive will be the capstone of a long and expensive US effort against ISIS that has seen it arm and train local forces, launch thousands of airstrikes and send US troops to the front lines. The offensive is also critical for an Iraqi military still trying to bounce back from 2014’s historic collapse  —   and the fate of the battle will rest with its soldiers. The start of the offensive raises a pressing question: can the same military that lost Mosul to ISIS win it back? Iraqi and US military planners will lead with their best shot. The troops in the convoy were members of Iraq’s elite special forces units, who have been the most effective forces in battling the militants in their Sunni Arab strongholds. Known as the   Service (CTS)  —   as well as Iraqi   Forces, Iraqi Special Operations Forces, or simply the Golden Division  —   they were founded by the US military after its invasion of Iraq in 2003. The CTS went on to become a key US partner during the occupation, helping to fight ISIS’s predecessor,   in Iraq, as well as Shiite militia. Many of its members were trained by US troops and are quick to recount fighting alongside them. In the war on ISIS, the CTS has led the way with key victories across the country. Their reward will be an exhaustive deployment in the largest battle against ISIS to date. “This is the final battle. This is to be or not to be,” said Sabah Noori, a spokesman for Iraqi special forces in Baghdad. “The future of Iraq is at stake in Mosul. And we will be in the front. ” The convoy’s drive north from Baghdad this week, to a makeshift base some 30 miles outside Mosul, stretched for 300 miles through   terrain. Towns and villages along the roadside had been reduced to rubble by the grueling campaign to roll back ISIS, and many still stand empty many months after being reclaimed. Toppled electric towers, destroyed homes, and car frames twisted from airstrikes were all common sights. Humvees in the long convoy bore signs of the long struggle too  —   almost all had indents from gunshots in their   glass. Gas tankers, armed personnel carriers, supply trucks and transport buses, painted in the CTS’s trademark black, filled out the procession. The vehicles arrived throughout the night in an abandoned village, and the troops scrambled to arrange their makeshift base. “One day I will be proud that I participated in the start of this offensive,” said one of the CTS’s top commanders, Maj. Salam Hussein, standing on a rooftop and looking out toward Mosul. “Right now we have a job to do. ” When the battle for Mosul begins, US fighter pilots will be flying over a uniquely modern field of war. On one side will be ISIS’s multinational militant army, with its squadrons of suicide bombers and fleets of   truck bombs. On the other, the Iraqi army, Kurdish peshmerga and Sunni Arab tribesmen will be advancing with small groups of US commandos among their ranks, as uniformed US soldiers may cover their advances with heavy artillery. Shiite militia fighters, who are sanctioned by the Iraqi government and have worked in the past with advisers from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, will be working in coordination with these   forces. Spurred by the shock of Mosul’s fall and put together on the fly amid the chaos that followed, often with a reluctant White House getting in the way, the strategy US military planners have created to roll back ISIS will face its most important test in Mosul. This strategy has relied on local forces, supported by US air power and advisers, to do the bulk of the fighting, shifting the burden of executing the war from masses of conventional US soldiers to small and elite units of US commandos who act as a force multiplier. These commandos are embedded with a dizzying array of armed groups  —   from   Kurdish militia in Syria to Arab tribesmen in Iraq and the peshmerga. They help to coordinate battles as well as arm and train their local allies, while also working in the shadows on select missions to take the fight to ISIS themselves. If the   effort is successful, it will signal the end of ISIS as a   force in Iraq, setting the stage for the isolation and eventual loss of its remaining territory in the country. At the peak of its military surge in the summer of 2014, ISIS controlled as much as 40 percent of Iraq. That number has shrunk to 10 percent today, with the bulk of people living under ISIS control concentrated in Mosul, which the Iraqi government estimates to contain at least one million civilians. ISIS’s Syrian capital of Raqqa, far smaller with some 200, 000 residents, could be won more easily once its supply routes from Iraq are cut. A defeat in Mosul would also be a defeat for the revolutionary core of the ISIS ideology  —   the idea of creating a caliphate across the borders of established countries, the promise to let its members live its hardline vision in the here and now, and the call for recruits to create a new world order as they destroy the old. Mosul has been crucial to ISIS’s identity from the start: While in Syria it won its territory from weaker rebel groups, in Mosul it defeated the   Iraqi army. It then paraded the captured US tanks and weapons for its TV cameras and bulldozed the border with Syria. It was at central Mosul’s Grand Mosque that ISIS’s leader, Abu Bakr   declared himself the new global caliph, delivering a call to arms: “Do jihad in the cause of God, incite the believers, and be patient in the face of this hardship. ” Because of the importance of Mosul to ISIS, soldiers and analysts alike expect the militants there to put up a bitter fight. They have been preparing their defenses for more than two years  —   digging tunnels, planting IEDs and, recently, filling trenches with oil to burn for cover from airstrikes. “That’s the   question. I lean toward a heavy fight,” said Omar Lamrani, a military specialist at the intelligence firm Stratfor, who said that at least 5, 000 ISIS fighters remained in the city. “And we’ve seen so much planning  —   tunnels, mines. I think it will be a significant stand. ” There were two Iraqi military divisions, numbering some 20, 000 soldiers, posted in Mosul when ISIS invaded the city with an estimated 1, 500 fighters. Most simply panicked and fled  —   and soldiers who were part of the rout later recounted that phone calls alerting them that the feared militants were coming was enough to get entire units to desert their posts. The US government suffered a black eye too in the defeat: when the Obama administration decided, in the face of heated domestic objections, to pull US troops from the country in 2011, it argued that the US trained and equipped Iraqi military could manage Iraq’s tenuous security situation on its own. Mosul provides a chance for both sides to right the wrong. And though Iraqi special forces have proven their merit in battling the militants, it is the   Iraqi military that will have to provide the bulk of the soldiers for the offensive  —   and hold the ground once it is won. Key to that mission is the Iraqi army’s 15th Division, which was built from scratch with the help of the US military and its allies in the aftermath of Mosul. Many of its soldiers and officers were part of the divisions that collapsed in Mosul  —   and eager for redemption, said Michael Knights, an Iraq expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who has embedded with local forces around the country. “Their story was we want to get back there and we’re feeling a bit of shame,” he said. “The guys who ran away are coming back. ” Shaping operations to set the stage for the offensive have been underway for months. From here, the offensive will likely play out in two stages. First,   forces are expected to advance toward the city and attempt to encircle it. Next would be the push into the city itself. “The main assault [of the first phase] is to happen west of the Tigris heading up north toward the mountains overlooking Mosul,” Lamrani said. “This will be the main thrust and spearheaded by 25, 000 Iraqi military and CTS and supported by tribal militia. And peshmerga would attack at the same time. At the end of that we’ll get to the point where Mosul is surrounded on all sides. ” US planners would likely seek to leave a small opening toward Syria “in the hope that ISIS fighters take that gap and flee because they would rather fight them in the open rather than in the city, especially in Mosul, where they have high density civilian areas,” Lamrani said. As CTS troops readied for the offensive at their base 3o miles outside Mosul, a senior officer with a long history of fighting ISIS cautioned against trying to predict how the battle with the extremists would play out. “You’re operating in an environment where your enemy is ready to do anything. Not just die  —   when I say ready to do anything, I mean he is ready to put civilians in danger to the furthest extent that he can. ” An official with the Kurdistan Regional Government likewise cautioned that it could be a difficult and unpredictable fight. “We are expecting up to six months of    fighting,” he said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t permitted to share this internal assessment. “It’s going to be a long, long battle. ” Just as crucial to winning the battle for Mosul will be the way that it is carried out. Aid groups have been sounding the alarm about a looming humanitarian disaster due to the civilians packed into the city. Shiite militia, which have faced accusations of committing crimes against Sunni civilians, have also vowed to push into   Mosul, despite U. S. objections, as part of the assault. The way those civilians are treated  —   and the way the assault on their home city plays out  —   will have a big effect on how they see the government that comes next. “This is probably the one time that Mosul will greet Americans with flowers and candy as they had predicted back in 2003,” said Rasha Al Aqeedi, a Mosul native and analyst at the Al Mesbar Studies and Research Center in Dubai. “I do believe that at this point that [Mosul residents] are so desperate they just want anyone to liberate them. They just don’t want the city to be completely ruined, and they want to survive it. ”   ", "sentence": {"content": "<div> BAGHDAD, Iraq — Soldiers cheered and honked the horns of their Humvees as their convoy rolled north on the highway out of Baghdad.

{"article": "Hillary Clinton supporters spooked by her   victory in Iowa likely woke up Tuesday morning chanting one thing: “firewall. ”  The belief is that once Clinton makes it past the   contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, where Sen. Bernie Sanders has a substantial lead in the polls ahead of next week’s primary, she can bank on a more diverse    and particularly Latinos and      to bulwark her support in the states that follow.  That   plan will get its first true test in Nevada, which hosts a Democratic caucus Feb. 20. It is home to a Latino electorate expected to make up   of the state’s 2016 voters, along with sizable   and   populations. It’s a place where Clinton has invested a considerable ground game, having won a majority of the popular vote in the 2008 caucus but losing in the delegate count to  . Barack Obama. But Nevada is also a state that is still finding its footing on the early primary calendar, meaning she and Sanders don’t have much of a conventional party network to exploit.  “Nevada is different than Iowa and New Hampshire because it’s just new at this. You don’t have those sort of pathways that are well known in those states,” said David  Damore, a political science professor at the University of   Vegas.  It’s that sort of blank slate that might make Nevada attractive to the Sanders campaign    which has amped up its efforts there and has already shown an interest in reaching out to young,   Latino voters, Early numbers suggest that his campaign was he was able to turn out the burgeoning Latino population in Iowa after an notable outreach campaign. “Both the Sanders campaign and the O’Malley campaign were tapping into that youthful population of ours,   caucusgoers, and clearly it gave some additional support to the Sanders’ campaign,” Joe Enriquez Henry    the Iowa director of the  League of United Latin American Citizens    told TPM.  Fifteen out of the 20 biggest districts with a Latino presence went to Sanders, according to Buzzfeed, and combined Latino participation in the Democratic and Republican caucuses grew from 1, 000 in 2012 to more than 10, 000 this year, according to initial exit poll estimates.  “We weren’t hearing much from the Clinton side,” Henry said, of the engagement with Latinos in Iowa. However, the Latino vote has not    by any standard    been ignored by the Clinton campaign in Nevada. Her campaign began building its network last April, according to officials. In May she gave a major early speech there, in addition to the listening sessions she attended with Hispanic residents. She has also picked up the endorsement of a number of state lawmakers, many of whom are participating themselves in the campaign’s    canvassing and voter education efforts. “We knew that the race was always going to tighten,” Jorge Neri, the Clinton camp’s organizing director in Nevada, told TPM. “What we know here is that the work that we did since April, the relationships that we built, the data we collected and the volunteers are what is going to carry us over here. ” Sanders, in the meantime, has been playing a game of  . He has appeared in Nevada frequently, but his campaign only really began to dig into the state in November. He has, however, picked up a few endorsements along the way, including that of Nevada Assemblywoman Lucy Flores. (The Sanders campaign did not return multiple inquiries by TPM). “There is an opening there,” Damore said, of Sanders’ potential for growth in the state. “A lot of Latinos are cynical about politics, they don’t trust politicians all that much. ” However, the Sanders camp has also hit some speed bumps. Its initial Nevada director, Jim Farrell, left the campaign early on, reportedly for family reasons. He has since been replaced by Joan Kato, an alum of Obama’s 2008 Latino outreach team.  More recently, the campaign got in trouble for sending operatives posing as union reps into employee dining halls in order to access workers. The move earned the condemnation of the culinary union  Local 226, which is a major player in the state and plays a crucial role in turning out voters. The union has signaled that it will not endorse a particular Democratic candidate this time around, but favored Obama over Clinton in 2008. Aside from the usual obstacles Latino voters face, Nevada is particularly tough state to mobilize voters    especially for the Democratic caucus, which in Nevada resembles the complicated process in Iowa.   “This is not like other states where they have long ties to a caucus,” Neri, of the Clinton campaign, said. Much of the campaign effort has focused on the   work of cleaning up their voting rolls and teaching potential caucusgoers the process.  “This is a state that is very, very hard,” he said. And as the 2014 GOP electoral sweep in the state showed, Democrats have a long way to go in establishing a dependable infrastructure in the  state. Nevadans are especially transient and many were hit hard by the mortgage crisis. Its residents’ reliance on cellphones also makes even the most basic of polling more difficult. Clinton’s ground game in Iowa did not deliver her the resounding win that could have quieted Sanders’ revolution for good. So the pressure is on her campaign to get a   for its investment in the West.  “They’ve done what they can do. They’ve organized down to the precinct level. She’s got the more established staff members. She comes here, she says the right things,” Damore said. “What Sanders hasn’t shown is that he can go beyond white voters. ” Tierney Sneed is a reporter for Talking Points Memo.

{"article": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is on his soapbox again. I implore everyone to ignore him. His message could be hazardous to your health. The lawyer, environmentalist and leading   crackpot, 63, who has compared widespread inoculations to “a holocaust,’’ threw a news conference Wednesday at The National Press Club in Washington, DC, that one top   expert described to me as “depressing. ’’ Appearing alongside Hollywood heavyweight Robert De Niro, 73, who has an autistic son, and other vaccine skeptics, he issued a $100, 000 challenge: Anyone who produces a   scientific study (at least one that RFK Jr. & Co. accept) proving that mercury in shots is safe for humans wins the hefty cash prize from Kennedy’s World Mercury Project. “On one hand, the government is telling pregnant women which   fish to avoid so that they don’t harm their fetuses, and on the other, the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] supports injecting   vaccines into pregnant women, infants and children,” said Kennedy, son of slain New York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of slain President John F. Kennedy. “This defies all logic and common sense. ” Kennedy claims to be  . Seriously. Yet he’s advancing the discredited theory that the shots cause autism and other neurological disorders by dangling money, with which he appears to have no intention of parting. This showboating marks a tragic new low in the health wars, according to Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “Vaccines are a victim of their own success,’’ said Offit. “People aren’t afraid of the diseases. They don’t see them. ’’ But they’re coming back. Measles, which claimed some 500 American lives annually before it was considered eradicated in the US in 2000, has returned, and there have been clusters of such similarly preventable illnesses as rubella, whooping cough and chicken pox. “There were 5, 100 cases of mumps last year,’’ Offit said  —   mentioning a disease about which I’d forgotten. He noted that mumps can cause “deafness in children and sterility in older people. ’’ Kennedy took aim at the   preservative thimerosal, which drug manufacturers removed from childhood vaccines out of an abundance of caution by 2001, but which is still used in some flu vaccines. Kennedy says it’s being given to “millions’’ of people, and alleges the paranoid theory that the government colluded with Big Pharma to put them at risk. Offit told me a person absorbs more mercury and other toxins by walking the streets of, say, New York City than from inoculations. Yet growing numbers of parents across the country, at least some of them freaked out by the misinformation, have found ways to opt out their kids from getting vaccinated. Less than 1 percent of incoming public and private school kids in New York state received religious or health exemptions from vaccines in the   academic year, according to Department of Health figures. But in   New Jersey, health officials sounded the alarm after parents of about 1. 9 percent of schoolchildren, and growing, failed to get their kids inoculated last school year, citing religious or medical reasons. Guardians of public health fear this could soon threaten the “herd immunity’’ that protects the unvaccinated, but requires that 90 to 95 percent of the population has shots. The   world, which should include all of us, has other worries. Kennedy on Wednesday said President Trump, who met with him Jan. 10, and members of his administration are still   on vaccine safety. (After Kennedy announced last month that he would chair it, a transition team spokeswoman said “no decisions have been made’’ about forming such a commission.) “What I’ve seen is that you put these massive injections at one time into a   baby. I’ve seen children who were 100 percent normal and become totally autistic,” Trump told me in 2015, saying he wants doctors to space out smaller injections over about two years. Physicians warn that could put children at risk for disease. Rejecting the gospel of RFK Jr. is the best way to achieve good health. Do it! Ever since    Etan Patz vanished while walking alone, for the first time, to his New York City school bus stop in 1979, most adults never again left their kids unwatched. Former bodega clerk Pedro Hernandez, 56, was    —   but not the top count of intentional murder. His lawyer vowed to appeal the verdict that could see him locked up for life. Let’s hope the convictions bring some peace to Etan’s family, as well as to folks in the city and beyond. Everyone whose lives have been changed forever by this little boy lost. Here he is  —   the American Boy doll. After 31 years of selling hunks of plastic in female form, American Girl this week   named Logan Everett, who plays drums in the band of a new girl doll, Tenney Grant. American Girl, now owned by Mattel Inc. has won kudos for introducing historical figures, such as a   doll, and criticism from me and others for veering into   with a “homeless’’ doll who lived in a car with her mom. But retailing at $115 apiece  —   not including extra clothes, accessories, even hairstyling done at American Girl stores  —   the price may drive away consumers. Will this “diverse’’ beastie help drive up the company’s currently flat sales? I doubt it. White House press secretary and “Saturday Night Live’’ target Sean Spicer was heard   (as many have) “You are a cheap Page Six reporter! ’’ Hey, as long as he gets the name right.", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> Robert F.

{"article": "Jane Mayer of The New Yorker has a new book out: “Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right. ” It’s mostly about those old devils the Koch brothers. Charles and David Koch are billionaires. They own a very big company. They also are very prominent philanthropists, giving hundreds of millions to cancer research, concert halls and other worthy causes. But what makes them hated and feared by progressives such as Mayer is their political work. They help fund some organizations and foundations, some purely educational, some partisan. To listen to the left, they are the closest thing we have to   James Bond villains. So what is their agenda? Is it to retreat to their orbiting harems, populated with fertile females, as they wipe out humanity below so that they can return to repopulate the planet? Or is to dupe the Russians and Americans into a nuclear squabble so that the Kochs can rule the ashes? Well, here’s Mayer’s explanation of their dark and sinister ambitions: “What people need to understand is the Kochs have been playing a very long game,” she told NPR’s Steve Inskeep. “And it’s not just about elections. It started four decades ago with a plan to change how America thinks and votes. So while some elections they win and some elections they lose, what they’re aiming at is changing the conversation in the country. ” Dear God, it’s worse than I thought! They want to change the conversation! They want to persuade Americans to vote differently! The horror, the horror. You might be forgiven for thinking that this is pretty much exactly what democracy is about. But no. For you see, only Hollywood, college professors and administrators, the ACLU, People for the American Way, the Human Rights Campaign, NARAL, Black Lives Matter, Occupy Wall Street, MoveOn. org, the NAACP, the Union of Concerned Scientists, Greenpeace, Tom Steyer, Michael Bloomberg, George Soros, Steven Spielberg and, of course, publications such as The New York Times, The New Republic, The Nation and Mayer’s own New Yorker are allowed to try to change conversations and argue for people to vote differently. Ah, but those voices are open and honest  —   and progressive!  —   about it, while the Kochs are secretive, sinister denizens of the stygian underworld of “dark money” and the “radical right. ” Except for the fact that the Kochs have been out in the open for nearly a  . David Koch ran for vice president on the Libertarian ticket in 1980, which you might argue is a brilliant way to hide in plain sight, given how little attention the Libertarian Party gets. Which brings me to that term “the radical right. ” When racist idiots do idiotically racist things, we’re told that’s the radical right in action. When Christian conservatives say Christian things, we’re told that’s the radical right in action. When Donald Trump says he wants to ban Muslims from entering the country or build a giant wall, that earns him the   label. When Ted Cruz says he wants to   the Islamic State, he . . . well, you get the point. I have myriad problems with those usages of “radical right,” but let’s stipulate for the sake of argument this is the correct term in such circumstances. How, then, are the Kochs members of the radical right? They are   marriage. They favor liberal immigration policies. They are passionate   when it comes to foreign policy. They are against the drug war and are spending a bundle on dismantling   “mass incarceration” policies. They’ve never seized a national park at gunpoint. They are members of the radical right for the simple reason that they don’t like big government and spend money to make that case. Full disclosure: I’ve given paid speeches to some   groups, despite the fact that I have my disagreements with the Kochs. They haven’t changed my mind, and I haven’t changed theirs. But the conversation continues. And that’s their great sin. Liberals are constantly talking about how we need an “honest conversation” about race or guns or this or that. But what they invariably mean is, they want everyone who disagrees to shut up. The best working definition of “right wing” today has almost nothing to do with the ideological content of what   say or do. A   is someone who disagrees with the liberal narrative, has the temerity to say so and dares to actually try to change the conversation.", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> Jane Mayer of The New Yorker has a new book out: “Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right. ” It’s mostly about those <span class=\"technique9\" id=\"row0annotation1\" technique9=\"0.47\"> old devils </span><sup class=\"technique9\" id=\"row0annotation1\">9</sup> the Koch brothers.

{"article": "Simon Cowell is returning to American television as a judge on the 11th season of “America’s Got Talent”  —   which Cowell created in 2006 (it spawned “Britain’s Got Talent,” on which Cowell is a judge). He’ll join host Nick Cannon and fellow judges Heidi Klum, Mel B. and Howie Mandel when the new season of “AGT” premieres May 31. Cowell, 56, was last seen in prime time here on “The X Factor,” the Fox version of his British hit which ended in December 2013 after three (mostly disappointing) seasons. Cowell talked to The Post about his role on “AGT,” what went wrong with “The X Factor” and his reputation as the “nasty” judge. [Laughs] Well, years ago, I had a conversation with NBC about doing this show and they offered me a really good deal overall. At the time I was on “Idol” and it didn’t feel like the right thing to do. NBC always had these conversations with me and the question was not if, but when. Howard [Stern, who left “AGT”] was doing good on the show and it was always his choice whether he wanted to stay or go, but we never knew year to year. He didn’t like the traveling, or whatever it was. Any thoughts I had about being the boss was soon shattered on Day One. These four know each other so well and I felt like the new boy  —   and almost like I had to prove myself. It’s obviously one of our biggest shows so I sometimes came in for the finals, or if I didn’t come in for the finals I watched them. I’d go down to the tapings sometimes and sit with the team. The only thing I felt was missing [was] I thought we could do better with the music acts. That wasn’t our strong point. We’ve had one successful singer over the years, Jackie Evancho, and I think with the “Got Talent” brand, even though it’s a variety show, I still think the music acts are important. That was my number one mission: To see if I could attract better music acts to the show. And we do have better music acts this season, that’s for sure. It was a mess. First of all, we should’ve waited for “Idol” to end and then launch “X Factor” in its spot. That would’ve been the smart thing   …     not having the shows on at the same time   …     In hindsight, we panicked   …     and I opened my big mouth when I said we’d get 20 million viewers [a week]. When I look back on it, some stupid decisions were made. But I’m a big boy. It’s a learning curve   …     And we got [singing group] Fifth Harmony from Season 2, so we found some stars. I don’t think you change as a person. When I look back at early [“American Idol”] clips   …     what people do forget is that I was different from the other judges  —   I was British and said what I’d always said. I thought it was funny, [that I was] not being mean. I think people also forget that what I did mainly in those early days was I found stars, whether it was Kelly Clarkson or Carrie Underwood. And I think people think more about the ‘mean’ things I said when I was really being positive and trying to help people and spot talent. That’s what I’m most proud of. No. I remember once [in 2007]   …     when I was in trouble for   I thought it was funny but, my God, did I get it in the neck. I never intended it to be that    —   it was supposed to be funny, more than anything else.", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> Simon Cowell is returning to American television as a judge on the 11th season of “America’s Got Talent” — which Cowell created in 2006 (it spawned “Britain’s Got Talent,” on which Cowell is a judge).

{"article": "Earlier this week, Fox News’ Tucker Carlson asked a guest on his show if it were true that the United States government has been “looting” Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. [His guest, a mortgage industry analyst named Joshua Rosner, described the bailout that has kept alive the two mortgage finance giants since their collapse in 2008 and subsequent need for $187. 5 billion of taxpayer funding, as “a simple theft. ”   Not a theft from taxpayers —  but from Fannie and Freddie’s shareholders. While it was jarring to see Carlson and Fox not even attempt to challenge an advocate for the two   mortgage companies —  long the targets of conservative critics who argued they distorted mortgage markets, enjoyed a privileged status of being   by the U. S. government even before they were bailed out, and were primary causes of the financial crisis —  Rosner’s basic argument is hardly new. Hedge funds and other big investors, including Perry Capital LLC and the Fairholme Funds, have been making similar arguments in federal courts for years —  to no avail. The cases have been met by dismissal in four federal district courts and last month a federal appeals court largely rejected the bid by investors to reverse one of those decisions. On Fox, however, Rosner gave the shareholder cause a novel twist —  one designed to appeal to conservatives and perhaps the Trump administration despite its lack of grounding in evidence or logic. According to Rosner, the U. S. Treasury is taking funds from Fannie and Freddie to pay for Obamacare —  perhaps the one thing loathed more by conservatives than bailouts of putatively private companies. “Essentially, in 2012, to avoid dealing with Republicans on the debt ceiling, on sequester, and to fund Obamacare, the Obama administration took Fannie and Freddie’s profits,” Rosner said. The message: if you hate Obamacare, you should support the cause of the hedge funds seeking to profit by prying Fannie and Freddie out of government hands.  And please pay no attention to the fact that the two companies have always needed —  and will always need, unless they are eliminated —  the backing of the U. S. taxpayer.  Fannie and Freddie: The Walking Dead, Fannie and Freddie provide liquidity to the housing market by buying mortgages from lenders, packaging them into securities whose principal and interest payments they guarantee. Prior to their 2008 collapse, Fannie and Freddie were widely viewed as enjoying an “implicit guarantee” from the U. S. government, enabling them to earn enormous profits because investors viewed their bonds as being safe —  or nearly so —  as U. S. Treasury bonds, The companies were taken over by the U. S. government in 2008 when officials feared their collapse could further destabilize the housing and financial markets. Treasury provided hundreds of billions of funding while the Federal Housing Finance Agency became their conservator.   Under their original agreement with the U. S. Treasury, both companies were supposed to pay a dividend equal to 10% of their taxpayer funding as well as a fee on the hundreds of billions more Treasury had pledged to support them. For years, however, neither company earned enough to pay the dividend, which forced them to draw even more from their bailout funds just to send the money back to Treasury as the dividend. This circular draw, as it came to be called, threatened to put the companies into a death spiral, slowly eating away at the remainder of the Treasury backstop. In   Treasury and the FHFA agreed to change the terms of the bailout so that Fannie and Freddie would no longer have a fixed dividend —  ending the need for circular draws. Instead, each company would have a flexible dividend obligation that would rise and fall with their profits. Because the new dividend is equal to the positive net worth of each company, less a small capital cushion set to decline each year, it is known as the “net worth sweep. ” At the time the net worth sweep was implemented, Treasury Department officials noted that in addition to ending the circular draws and death spiral, the arrangement would facilitate the eventual wind down of the companies by preventing them from using profits to recapitalize as   designed a safe, more stable mortgage finance system.  Because every attempt at bipartisan mortgage finance reform legislation stalled out on Capitol Hill, neither company has been  . Instead, they have remained in conservatorship and supported by taxpayer backing for more than eight years —  a situation that nearly everyone involved in mortgage finance reform regards as undesirable. “These companies are zombies. They died in 2008 but they’ve been kept alive by the contaminant of government backing ever since —  all because every attempt to build a better system has gone nowhere,” said one former government housing official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Conservatives Balk At Net Worth Sweep For Keeping Companies Alive, The net worth sweep was designed by the Obama administration in part to placate conservative critics of the two companies. Obama housing officials believed that merely lowering the dividend obligation to a level the companies could afford would invite criticism from Republican lawmakers that Fannie and Freddie were getting a second bailout —  a bailout from their bailout. Since the net worth sweep would produce larger dividends if the companies were highly profitable and lower dividends when they were not, it balanced the risks to taxpayers with potential rewards, in the view of several Obama administration officials who spoke on background. Nonetheless, the net worth sweep met with initial resistance from Republican lawmaker who feared it would delay the wind down of the companies. “The reduction of the dividend payments for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will ensure the American taxpayers remain on the hook for the bailout of these two failed institutions,” Congressman Scott Garrett ( ) the chairman of the House Financial Service Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Entities, said in a statement.  “Instead of devoting time and energy to prolonging bailouts, Obama administration should work with Congress to wind these companies down and create a new and sustainable housing finance system where taxpayers are not at risk,” Rep. Garrett said. This prompted an email, made public in one of the shareholder lawsuits, from an Obama administration official named Jim Parrott to complain that the net worth sweep had been misunderstood.  “We’re not reducing their dividend but including in it every dime these guys make going forward and ensuring that they can’t recapitalize,” Parrott wrote to one of Rep. Garrett’s staffers. This didn’t fully satisfy the staffer. “In regards to them keeping additional profits, in my mind that is only an accounting issue, gov recoups now (per new method) or later when we liquidate them and then realize those gains for the taxpayer,” the staffer wrote back. Summarizing the    Parrott wrote to the Treasury Department’s Timothy Bowler: “We’ve closed off possibility that they every [sic] go (pretend) private again and sped up the clock on the wind down of their portfolio, all while increasing the stability of the markets by removing concern that these guys run out of support before we have a place to which to transition. ” Despite this initial resistance, however, there was very little sustained opposition from conservatives to the net worth sweep —  largely because it was presented as a step toward the wind down of Fannie and Freddie.  The Hedge Funds Strike Back, Resistance to the sweep arose from another, unanticipated quarter: hedge fund managers and other large investors who acquired large amounts of the preferred and common shares of Fannie and Freddie —  betting that the government wouldn’t succeed in winding them down and that they would eventually be revived. Several hedge funds made a fortune in the wake of the financial crisis by snapping up shares of   financial companies, such as failed insurance giant AIG and banking giants Citigroup Bank of America, when many investors still shunned the sector. Investors like Bruce Berkowitz of Fairholme and John Paulson of Paulson  Co, who had made a fortune shorting housing before the crisis, came to see themselves as heroic allies of the government’s attempt to rescue the financial companies. Some former Obama administration officials encouraged them to see Fannie and Freddie as presenting similar opportunities. If the government couldn’t wind down the entities, these former officials said, it might wind up recapitalizing them and releasing them to the public —  just as it had with AIG. With the common shares trading at pennies a share and the preferred at deep discounts to face value, the upside potential could be huge. Perry Capital, Paulson  Co, and Fairholme Funds all acquired stakes in the companies. Later, activist investor William Ackman’s Pershing Square would become the largest holder of the common stock of Fannie and Freddie. Others followed the lead of these prominent investors. The trouble was that the Obama administration did not go along with what the hedge fund managers believed to be the script to their next windfall play. It insisted that the companies remain in conservatorship —  and subject to the net worth sweep —  so long as no comprehensive housing finance reform was forthcoming. Which meant that instead of acting as allies of government policies, the funds were now fighting it. Perry Capital, Fairholme and Pershing Square all sued the government in federal court. They argued that the ongoing conservatorship violated the law and that they net worth sweep illegally deprived them of the profits of the companies.  It quickly became conventional wisdom on Wall Street that the net worth sweep was “obviously illegal. ” Shares of the companies rocketed upward as investors piled into the trade that the “smart money” had endorsed. Top flight legal scholars, such as New York University’s Richard Epstein and Yale University’s Jonathan Macey, added their support to the hedge fund cause —  in Epstein’s case, at least, while receiving consulting fees from one of the investors. Hopes for a court room victory were bolstered as Fannie and Freddie turned in record profits in 2013 and 2014, thanks in part to reversals of past losses,   of once abandoned deferred tax assets, and legal settlements with large banks. Shareholders gleefully declared the government’s worry about a death spiral as a ruse and described the mortgage giants as “the most profitable companies in the world,” ignoring warnings that the artificially high profit levels would soon fall. In subsequent years, however, profits did fall by enough that both companies would once again have struggled or failed to pay the original 10 percent dividend. The Influence Vultures Take Flight, Paulson  Co did not join the lawsuits, although his internal legal advisors believed the courts would side with the investors, according to people familiar with the matter. But that didn’t mean Paulson sat by passively. Instead, Paulson helped finance a behind the scenes lobbying campaign urging the government to relinquish its controls on the mortgage giants, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. Lobbying efforts included campaign donations to sympathetic politicians as well as giving cash to minority advocacy groups that voiced support for Fannie and Freddie, the Wall Street Journal reported. Some advocacy groups in Washington, D. C. began offering donations to groups and individuals who agreed to write   advocating for the release and recapitalization of Fannie and Freddie, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. The Wall Street Journal reported that the Raban Group, a Washington lobbying firm, offered a minority trade association $25, 000 contingent on signing its name to an   arguing for the    of Fannie and Freddie, according to the Wall Street Journal. In 2014, John Paulson’s private foundation donated $25, 000 to the Leadership Conference Education Fund, an arm of a coalition of   civil rights advocacy groups, the Wall Street Journal revealed. The Leadership Conference has been an outspoken advocate for the release of Fannie and Freddie to private control.  The DCI Group, a Washington lobbyist outfit that works on behalf of Fannie and Freddie shareholder pressure group Investors Unite, gave the Leadership Conference a total of $325, 000 in donations, according to the Wall Street Journal.  In June of 2016, a group of primarily   New York Baptist ministers calling itself ‘Our Loans Matter’ held a rally near Wall Street. Video of the rally was posted on Twitter by none other than Tucker Carlson’s Obamacare funding critic Josh Rosner, who is manging director at Graham Fisher  Co. which bills itself as an independent research consultancy. The accompanying hashtag: #ourloansmatter.  “Wow.  #OurLoansMatter rally in Wall Street w leading Pastors,” Rosner said in another tweet. Wow. #OurLoansMatter rally in Wall Street w leading Pastors pic. twitter.   —   joshua rosner (@JoshRosner) June 17, 2016,  The Our Loans Matter group decried efforts to   Fannie and Freddie, saying they would hurt homeownership opportunities for “our parishioners,” in an October 2016 letter to New York’s Senator Chuck S`chumer and the FHFA’s Mel Watt. That same summer, Rosner appeared on Perspectives, a television show “geared to discussing contemporary topics affecting the   community. ” His message there was very different than the one he delivered to Tucker Carlson about Fannie and Freddie’s profits allegedly being used to support Obamacare. Instead, he argued that the government is “now in the process of eliminating Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, essentially to hand the business to the big banks, who already are the ones who are likely to overcharge borrowers for home loans. ” There’s no evidence that most big banks want to be in the business of being in the   position on the types of loans Fannie and Freddie tend to back. In fact, the biggest banks have been losing market share to nonbank lenders and retreating from the riskier parts of the market. Rosner went on to argue that eliminating Fannie and Freddie would reduce minority homeownership —  and thereby increase crime, damage the quality of education and reduce people to being “wage slaves. ” Rosner has long been an advocate of homeownership while still criticizing loose credit the practices of banks as well as Fannie and Freddie. Indeed, he was one of the few who understood years before the financial crisis that Fannie and Freddie had taken on —  and disguised —  far more credit risk than they should. He famously criticized low to no downpayment mortgages by saying, “A home without equity is just a rental with debt. ” Currently, he argues that Fannie and Freddie should become   utilities whose profits and practices are stringently regulated but whose shares are owned by investors. His views are not influenced by hedge funds or other investors in Fannie and Freddie, he said. “I put my own views out there and I’ve been remarkably consistent. Anyone who looks at my record knows I’m not for sale,” Rosner said in an phone interview.   Crash and Burn, Despite the sums spent on lobbying and litigating against the government, the hedge funds and other investors did not gain much traction. The Obama administration stood firm in its position that Fannie and Freddie would not be released or recapitalized without congressional action. Capitol Hill lawmakers agreed, including in 2015’s omnibus budget “sense of Congress” provision that demanded the the administration make no changes to Fannie and Freddie’s status without congressional approval. The passage of time did not improve the odds for the hedge funds. As recently as last week, a bipartisan group of Senators sent a letter to FHFA director Mel Watt, who oversees the conservatorships of Fannie and Freddie, that he should not allow the companies to recapitalize without congressional approval. The lawmakers warned against “any administrative action that would adversely impact” efforts underway to legislate housing finance reform. If Capitol Hill and the White House have been cool to the hedge funds’ pleas, the reception in federal courts has been even frostier. In the fall of 2014, a federal court completely dismissed a group of shareholder lawsuits, finding that the government acted well within its rights when it implemented the net worth sweep. At first, the decision was derided by shareholders and their advocates but as court after court reached similar conclusions —  including the influential D. C. Circuit —  hopes for a hedge fund win in the courts withered. Rosner points out that the Obama administration kept from the public over 10, 000 documents investors have sought in connection with the litigation, a practice that the Trump administration has continued. He argues that the documents are likely to show that the motivations for putting in the net worth sweep were different from those stated by government officials. In any case, the public deserves to know what is in those documents, Rosner says. “Let’s see what’s in them. I think it will be  . If I’m wrong about the motivations here, I’ll be the first to say so,” Rosner said in a phone interview. Hope Revived, Briefly  The election of Donald Trump as President briefly revived hopes that the administration would embrace a policy that would bring the   windfall to Fannie and Freddie investors. Although Trump himself has not taken a position on housing finance reform, Fannie investor John Paulson had been a big fund raiser for Trump, hosting a $50, 000 per plate dinner in NYC. Paulson was reportedly picked to be the Trump transition teams advisor on housing policy. What’s more, Trump had reportedly invested between $3 million and $15 million in Paulson’s hedge fund. A day after he was tapped to be Trump’s Treasury Secretary nominee, Steve Mnuchin appeared to bolster the prospects that the hedge funds could finally wrest control of Fannie and Freddie from the government.  “We got to get Fannie and Freddie out of government ownership,” Steven Mnuchin said on Fox Business Network in November. “It makes no sense that these are owned by the government and have been controlled by the government for as long as they have. ” “Trump Treasury May Mean Independence for Fannie and Freddie,” the New York Times declared in a headline. The accompanying article was written by columnist Gretchen Morgenson, who   2011’s Reckless Endangerment with Josh Rosner. Shares of Fannie and Freddie soared. Morgenson described the euphoria among the   Fannie and Freddie investors that followed these comments:  The revival of this particular dream of avarice, however, was quickly quashed. At his confirmation hearing in January, Mnuchin told the Senators his comments had been misinterpreted. “My comments were never that there should be a recap and release,” Mnuchin said. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has continued to fight the hedge funds in court —  and continued to stack up legal victories. There are no signs that the Justice Department, Treasury, or the FHFA is considering settling with the litigious hedge funds or backing away from the government’s strong hand in these lawsuits. Sources inside the Treasury Department say the administration is still reviewing a wide variety of housing financing reforms options but is not planning on making any changes to the conservatorship or dividend of Fannie and Freddie without congressional authorization. On Capitol Hill, Senators and Representatives are already at work on a new version of housing finance reform legislation —  one that is unlikely to leave any value left over for shareholders of Fannie and Freddie, according to people familiar with the matter. “These guys overreached and they’ve accomplished something rare: bipartisan alienation. Both Republican and Democrat leaders can’t stand these Fannie hedge fund guys,” a person close to Capitol Hill housing reform efforts said. Time Traveling Obama Officials and Other Villians, Despite this most recent setback, efforts continue to influence the right to adopt the hedge funds’ position on Fannie and Freddie, in hopes that the Trump administration can still be brought around to changing its views.   legal scholars have been recruited and, in some cases, paid to write   and conservative outlets such as the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Daily Caller have run pieces adopting the hedge fund line on Fannie, Freddie, and the net worth sweep.  The latest argument appears   to lure in conservatives with claims that the Obama administration illicitly diverted funds from Fannie and Freddie to bankroll portions of the Affordable Care Act. Specifically, the funds were allegedly used to provide a substitute funding source after a federal court ruled that some subsidies that had been provided to insurers were improper. The trouble is that the changes to Fannie and Freddie’s bailout that net worth sweep in place were made in 2012, while the judge’s ruling on the Obamacare subsidies didn’t come until 2016. What’s more, the judge in the case has allowed the payments to continue pending appeal, which means there still isn’t a budget gap to fill. Absent a trip in Dr. Who’s TARDIS, it is unlikely the Obama administration foresaw an adverse court ruling four years in advance then put in place a controversial change to Fannie and Freddie’s bailout to avoid it. Another recent tactic has been to target those in the Trump administration viewed as both vulnerable and potential opponents of the hedge fund Fannie and Freddie agenda. Craig Phillips, a former BlackRock Inc. executive who was a big fundraiser for Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid, has recently come under fire. Phillips is leading Treasury’s review financial regulations —  and many on Capitol Hill worry he is not a supporter of the administration’s agenda to rollback the regulations. Supporters of the hedge fund agenda for Fannie and Freddie have been playing on these concerns and Phillips’ connections to former Obama administration officials in hopes that if conservatives were to force Phillips out, he could be replaced by a more pliant Treasury official. “They’ve flipped from seeking support from the civil rights types to seeking support from conservatives and libertarians,” said a staffer of a Republican Congressman who has been approached about his position on Fannie and Freddie. This type of political flexibility is not altogether unheard of in the nation’s capital. Back in 2011, Josh Rosner, who advocated for preserving Fannie and Freddie to preserve minority homeowners in 2016 and decried the alleged use of their funds to support Obamacare in 2017, appeared before a House oversight panel alongside Dr. Anthony Sanders, a George Mason University finance professor. “I really want to go with what the administration said earlier, which is to start paring them down if not dismantling them,” Sanders told the panel after arguing that Fannie and Freddie’s guarantees were keeping private capital out of the mortgage market. “I totally agree with that,” Rosner said moments later.

Indeed, Antic’s 2016 lawsuit focuses more on the “reputational harm” he claims resulted from media coverage of his arrest rather than any specific physical injuries.

{"article": " The most heated fight at the Rio Olympics lasted just a minute and four seconds. It was a battle between good and evil, the fair and unfair, the clean and the cheaters, with a hint of a Cold War twist.    The conflict: a   breaststroke battle between two swimmers, American Lilly King and Russian Yulia Efimova. In Sunday’s qualifying race, King and Efimova came in first and second place, respectively, with times   of a second apart. But as they entered the aquatic center on Monday to swim in the final, there was a lot more riding on their matchup than an Olympic medal. Efimova’s reputation was tainted by controversy, as she had previously failed two drug tests and served a   suspension. In the end, King defeated Efimova and clinched the gold medal. But her victory was so much more than a personal win.    Who is Yulia Efimova? Efimova’s story of athletic success is marred by cheating  —   namely, positive drug tests. Efimova is one of the top swimmers in the world in breaststroke, winning world championships in the   and   events since she made her debut at the Beijing Olympics in 2008. At the London games in 2012, she won bronze in the   breaststroke.    In 2013, Efimova tested positive for DHEA, a banned steroid hormone considered an anabolic agent by the World   Agency. She served a   ban for the substance. Then, earlier this year, Efimova tested positive for meldonium, the substance that Maria Sharapova tested positive for. A month ago, Efimova wasn’t even supposed to be swimming at the Olympics.    ”She was one of seven Russian swimmers barred from the games who had either failed doping tests or were named in the World   Agency’s investigation into   doping,” the Los Angeles Times reported, explaining the International Swimming Federation’s second ban on Efimova But this past week, Efimova was reinstated, much to the dismay of both swimming fans and fellow athletes. Why do people hate Efimova? On Sunday, August 7, Efimova swam in the   breaststroke preliminary heat. After qualifying for the final with the   time, Efimova was booed. She raised her finger in a ”number one” sign after the race. It was a surreal scene, the type that just doesn’t happen at the Olympics.    Essentially, lots of people  —   her competitors, NBC’s commentators, fans  —   believe Efimova doesn’t deserve to be at the Olympics. In their eyes, she got away with cheating. She can’t shake the lingering specter that her qualifying time might be due to doping. And what about the women who don’t dope that she’s already beaten in races? ”You know, you’re shaking your finger number one and you’ve been caught for drug cheating,” King said in an interview with NBC after taking the top spot in the   qualifier. While waiting for her heat to begin, she watched Efimova’s semifinal and wagged her finger at the swimmer. ”I’m just not a fan,” King added. As SB Nation explains, Efimova could have been facing a lifetime ban for her second doping violation. But she was given a sliver of grace. ”Because she tested positive soon after the drug was added to the list of prohibited drugs in January, Efimova was cleared to participate in the Olympics in July,” the site reported. ”The International Swimming Federation allowed her and many others back in the pool on the basis that it was unclear just how long meldonium stays in the body.” Efimova’s history of cheating put an ugly tint on Monday’s final  —   making it so much more than just a competition about who can swim the fastest. It became about the integrity of the sport. Efimova became the embodiment of the systemic doping in the Russian athletic system. And Lilly King became the only person who could conceivably beat her. The   breaststroke final was amazing and lived up to the hype  Even with all the stakes and beef present in the women’s   breaststroke final, it lived up to expectations. Thanks to their very close qualifying times, King and Efimova were placed in lanes right next to each other. King stared Efimova down as the two waited to begin the race. When Efimova’s name was announced, the crowd let loose a flurry of boos.    King was slightly ahead of Efimova for about 75 percent of the race. But Efimova has great closing speed and pushed King at the very end  —   King really had to work to hold onto her scrap of a lead and ended up finishing with a time of 1 minute 4. 93 seconds  —   good enough for gold and a half a second faster than Efimova. Efimova had been silent leading up to the race, and didn’t outright address the doping allegations until after she won silver. In a   interview she intimated that the first doping violation was her fault, but this second was out of her control. ”I have once made mistakes and been banned,” Efimova said. ”The second time it was not my mistake.” After the race, NBC’s Michele Tafoya asked King if she was trying to send a message with her win. ”I hoped I did, that we can compete clean and still win at the Olympic Games,” King said. When King beat Efimova, she slapped the water in between them in triumph. She shot over a stare. And Efimova didn’t raise her finger.    ”There is a way to become the best and do it the right way,” King said at press conference after her race. Efimova races again in the   breaststroke on Wednesday.

{"article": "Obama used a presidential proclamation to expand the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument off the coast of Hawaii by over 400, 000 square miles. The preserve now stretches 582, 578 square miles, the world’s largest marine protected area.  ”The expansion provides critical protections for more than 7, 000 marine species . .. [and] will allow scientists to monitor and explore the impacts of climate change on these fragile ecosystems,” the White House said in a statement, citing the support of Sen. Brian Schatz and ”prominent Native Hawaiian leaders.”  But the decision drew sharp criticism from the fishing industry and even fellow Democrats, as it will drastically expand the area where commercial fishing and drilling is banned.  Former Democratic Gov. George Ariyoshi said at a rally last month that it came down to the question of who actually owned the ocean. “The ocean belongs to us,” Ariyoshi reportedly said. “We ought to be the ones who decide what kind of use to make of the ocean. ” Representatives from the fishing industry warn the move will increase prices and imports, The Honolulu Star Advertiser reported. All commercial extraction activities will be prohibited within the area, though   fishing is allowed by permit.  The regional council that manages U. S. waters in the Pacific Islands said the decision ”serves a political legacy” rather than a conservation benefit. ”Closing 60 percent of Hawaii’s waters to commercial fishing, when science is telling us that it will not lead to more productive local fisheries, makes no sense,” said Edwin Ebiusi Jr. chairman of the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council. ”Today is a sad day in the history of Hawaii’s fisheries and a negative blow to our local food security.” The Pew Charitable Trusts, which supported the expansion, gave an idea of how big the area truly is, saying more than three Californias could be squeezed into it:   How big is Hawaii’s new expanded marine monument? THIS BIG.  https:  .  #MahaloObama pic. twitter.  According to the Star Advertiser, the idea was proposed to Obama by Native Hawaiian leaders, who argued the waters in the area contained sharks and large predatory fish that have been overfished in other areas and were in need of protection. The move has also been backed by environmentalists and some scientists.  Other Democrats praised Obama’s action, with Sen. Brian Schatz,   calling it “one of the most important actions an American president has ever taken for the health of the oceans. ” With the announcement, Obama will have created or expanded 26 national monuments. The administration said Obama has protected more acreage through national monument designations than any other president. Obama will travel to Midway Atoll, within the monument, on Thursday as part of a visit to Hawaii next week. His visit will come after he addresses leaders from the Pacific Island Conference of Leaders and the IUCN World Conservation Congress. The monument was first designated by President George W. Bush in 2006. The announcement came after Obama used his executive authority to create the National Park Service’s newest national monument at Katahdin Woods and Waters in Maine. The new monument was created as part of the 100th anniversary of the creation of the National Park Service. The White House said the monument will protect 87, 500 acres and will bolster the forest’s resilience against the impact of climate change.  The monument’s creation, though, was opposed by state lawmakers and critics who warn it will hinder efforts to rebuild a   economy in the region.  “President Obama is once again taking unilateral action against the will of the people, this time the citizens of rural Maine,” Republican Gov. Paul LePage said. “The Legislature passed a resolution opposing a National Monument in the North Woods, members of Maine’s Congressional delegation opposed it and local citizens voted against it repeatedly.” The move also was opposed by Sen. Susan Collins and Rep. Bruce Poliquin, both Republicans.  “Our local job creators —  not Washington bureaucrats —  know best how to use our working forests and provide proper access for industries to create more jobs including those in the outdoor recreation businesses, like snowmobiling, hunting, rafting, camping and so on,” Poliquin said in a statement.

{"article": " (CNN) The use of a robot to kill the man who authorities say fatally shot five Dallas police officers has drawn attention in part because it’s the first time police have used robots in such a manner. Below is a series of questions that I have been asked frequently and preliminary answers. The facts remain incomplete, so these are preliminary thoughts.  What happened? In the wake of the shooting of the Dallas police officers Thursday night during a peaceful protest, police cornered the shooter     Micah Xavier Johnson    in a parking garage. After an   standoff that included exchanges of gunfire, they used a robot to deliver an explosive that killed the gunman.    Why did they use it? ”We saw no other option but to use our bomb robot and place a device on its extension for it to detonate where the subject was,” Dallas Police Chief David Brown said at a news conference Friday morning. ”Other options would have exposed our officers to grave danger.” What robot was used? The system has been reported as a Northrop Grumman Remotec Andros, which is a   bomb disposal robot commonly used by police, military and other first responders around the world. It is wheeled, weighs around 220 kg (485 pounds) and mounts various sensors and a robotic arm with grippers.  Why is this being reported as a big deal? This is the first use of a robotic system by the police in a deliberately lethal manner.  Are there parallels or past precedents by the police? Robots are used all the time by police bomb squads forces around the world in bomb disposals. They are also frequently used in surveillance roles by SWAT teams and the like. They have been used in standoffs with armed gunmen in a variety of examples, from helping to figure out where the gunman is hiding to delivering pizza to the gunman and hostages during negotiations when a person wasn’t allowed in. But none of these involved delivering lethal force.  The closest parallel I am aware of was a case in 2011, when police in Tennessee strapped tear gas grenades to a robot that then accidentally started a fire in a mobile home. This doesn’t seem a great parallel, as it does not reflect a decision deliberately to use the robot to kill. Another parallel would be the 1985 standoff in Philadelphia between law enforcement and the MOVE group. Manned police helicopters dropped two small explosive devices on the roof to try to open a breach into the building below where the group was bunkered in. Instead, the building caught fire, killing 11 in the blaze, and burning down many neighboring buildings. Again here, the parallel isn’t a perfect one. While it did involve a bomb, there was no robot, nor was it a deliberate use in the way authorities used the robot in Dallas.  What about in war? The best parallel that I am aware of is a case that I wrote about in my 2009 book ”Wired for War.” A U. S. Army soldier discussed how his unit in Iraq in the mid 2000s was equipped with a surveillance robot known as a MARCBOT. This is a remotely operated surveillance robot, equipped with a mast holding a small camera, not the kind used in Dallas. It costs about $8, 000. Their unit used the robotic system for roles like checkpoint duty if there was a car that was suspected of being a car bomb, they would send the robot for a close look, rather than a risk one of their people.  When they faced off with an armed insurgent holed up in an alley, the soldier told of how they came up with an ad hoc answer. They   the robot with an explosive device (literally   a claymore mine on it) and drove it down the alley to kill the insurgent, rather than risking a soldier. Why would the police have a bomb with them? It has not been reported which type of explosive was used, but it is important to note that it was clearly not the common image of a ”bomb” like the type dropped by an  . Police SWAT teams have small explosive charges that they use for breaches (to blow open a locked door or a hole in the wall to get around a gunman behind a door) while bomb squads sometimes will place  small explosive charges beside a known or suspected bomb to detonate it in a safe manner.  Update: Dallas PD has confirmed that the explosive device on the robot was a   C4 plastic explosive plus ”Det” cord, fitting with the analysis above. How does this link to the ”killer robots” debate?  While there are links to the discussion on the future of killer robots, known as LAWS (lethal autonomous weapons systems) there are also three important differences to keep in mind. First, this was not an autonomous robot both the robot and the explosive were remotely operated. Second, this was not a designed weapons system. There are many ground robots under development that are armed with weapons like machine guns and missile launchers, from the prototypes of the US MAARS to the Chinese Sharp Claw. But this was the case of using an older robot designed for something else. And, third, the concerns driving the ”killer robots” debate center on whether we can prevent the unleashing of   robots on the battlefield, for which militaries around the world are beginning to establish plans and doctrines. The debate is driven by a concern that such a future might cause both greater civilian harm and a lack of accountability.  By contrast, this was an ad hoc use, just like the case in Iraq. There is no doctrine that planned this out, no training manuals that police were following, nor development programs for this use. It also doesn’t appear to have risked civilian harm or raised accountability concerns of the kind that motivate the killer robots debate. There are links to that debate but they are more about the many different directions robot use might go to next. But doesn’t it portend a future of lethal police robots? It is too early to draw that conclusion. An important first use of robots in a lethal way by police was established. But you can counter whether that important first will open the floodgates with two opposite points. First, police forces around the world are already equipped with this type of robotic system. So it can’t cause mass spread of the technology since that spread was already under way. And, second, important precedents of use aren’t always followed. They can either prove to be exceptional circumstances or the public   police decide against them in the aftermath. Take the case of the 1985 MOVE standoff police helicopters dropped bombs, but that didn’t become a common practice in the years since.  What we can confidently conclude is that we will see greater and greater use of robotics in all sorts of roles, whether it be by the military, law enforcement, or just the rest of us in civilian life. Indeed, some 80 plus countries already have robotics in their militaries, while companies that range from Google to Tesla to Uber to Ford are planning on a future of ”  cars.” In policing, the robotics trend has been moving towards greater use of drones in surveillance roles, from smaller ones that might be used by individual units to large ones that could monitor an entire neighborhood or city. The key here is to distinguish the decision of unmanning a system from arming it. Just as manned police planes or helicopters are not armed (police don’t fly Apache attack helicopters or  ) the trend towards their unmanning doesn’t somehow mean they have to be armed. So, too, manned police ground vehicles, whether they be patrol cars or even military surplus MRAPS don’t mount cannons or machine guns like their military equivalent neither do the unmanned versions have to be armed by definition.  Before this incident, when it came to arming robotic systems in a law enforcement role, most of the discussion has been of ones using ”less than lethal” weapons. At a number of trade shows, robotic systems have been displayed that mount tasers and tear gas to China’s controversial Anbot, which is a police bot designed to operate autonomously and equipped with an electroshock device similar to a cattle prod. These, of course, prompt great debate that brings together elements of the robotics argument with the question over whether ”less than lethal” weapons actually lead to abuse (think about the debate over Tasers  they arguably save lives, yet might be used more often). Did the Dallas Police do the right thing? I’m not going to second guess them. The information isn’t all in, emotions are high, and the best judges of that are going to be experts on SWAT team tactics and lawyers that specialize in police use of force issues. In no way, shape, or form is any of this a condemnation. Indeed, it is the opposite. My reaction is similar to the one I had to the case mentioned above in Iraq I wasn’t there, but can certainly understand and, even more, empathize with what the people on the scene decided to do. At the same time, my analytic side can recognize that this is a big issue that has provoked debate.  Is this another sign of the ”militarization” of police in the U. S.? I have a hard time making that connection now. The debate over the militarization of the police seems to turn on 1) the use of equipment designed for war, often provided in surplus from the U. S. military, and 2) in a manner that is intimidating or threatening to the public.  In this incident, the technology is not one that is only used in war and it was not used in a way that was targeting the broader public indeed it was the opposite. Remember, the police in Dallas who were shot and killed were there protecting peaceful protesters, not intimidating them. Images from the scene beforehand showed police and protesters smiling together. In turn, when violence struck, the police on the scene bravely moved protesters to safety, while the media reported that protesters helped police find the shooter. The police and protesters were in it together so we, in turn, should not let people try to exploit the tragedy as a means to divide.  What are the overall issues at hand? Obviously, this use of robotic technology in a lethal manner was a big first and one can imagine pathways that take you into those concerns. Yet, even though I am someone who has written widely on robotics, the events of this last week leave me more concerned over other trends. The issue of robotics may be new, but the ease of mass violence in our society, the worsening of   relations, and all the challenges of race in America are problems that were there well before the tragic events in Minnesota, Louisiana, and now Texas. These are what we must face, and, most importantly, face together.", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> (CNN) The use of a robot to kill the man who authorities say fatally shot five Dallas police officers has drawn attention in part because it’s the first time police have used robots in such a manner. Below is a series of questions that I have been asked frequently and preliminary answers. The facts remain incomplete, so these are preliminary thoughts. What happened? In the wake of the shooting of the Dallas police officers Thursday night during a peaceful protest, police cornered the shooter Micah Xavier Johnson in a parking garage. After an standoff that included exchanges of gunfire, they used a robot to deliver an explosive that killed the gunman. Why did they use it? ”We saw no other option but to use our bomb robot and place a device on its extension for it to detonate where the subject was,” Dallas Police Chief David Brown said at a news conference Friday morning. ”Other options would have exposed our officers to grave danger.” What robot was used?

{"article": " With the debacle of health care reform in the rearview window, conservatives in Congress and the White House are turning their sights on President Barack Obama’s financial regulations. All indications are that the GOP is more unified in how they want to go about “repealing and replacing” these regulations  —   most of which were passed as part of the   Act in 2010.    For the past six years, these reforms have provided key protections to consumers and stability to the banking system by protecting consumers. They’ve made banks more resilient and created stability in the capital markets.  Expect Republicans, as in the case of the health care bill, to attack the regulations by way of the budget: specifically, through the “budget reconciliation” process that eliminates the threat of a Democratic filibuster. Contrary to many headlines, the executive orders President Donald Trump has released so far related to banking regulations do little more than call for reviews. Reviews are the sort of thing a   administration would normally have quietly done during the transition. True, Trump can do damage to financial reform when he appoints regulators hostile to enforcing the law. But undoing the regulations won’t be as simple as flipping a switch, or swapping out one set of political appointees for another. There would have been no point in passing something like   if a Republican president could overturn it by fiat.    It is unlikely, also, that Congress will overturn   with a big bill. The Senate is the crucial threshold, and the legislation Republicans have floated is so aggressive it’s unlikely it can get 60 votes. The CHOICE Act that has been proposed by Republicans in the House would repeal or dismantle virtually every part of   from the Volcker Rule (which prevents commercial banks from making certain kinds of speculative trades) to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to the ability to prevent a collapsing financial firm from bringing down the broader economy.     But the CHOICE Act goes still further, splitting the Federal Reserve in half and preventing it from coordinating financial regulations and monetary policy, something that will make bubbles more likely  —   and more dangerous to the economy. It would reduce the deference given to regulatory agencies, making regulations harder to pass, and harder to interpret. Republicans did not seek any Democrat input on the bill, and as such it’s unlikely to gain the support it needs to overcome a filibuster. Bloomberg’s Matt Levine called the bill “a kitchen sink of grievances. ” Yet there’s a way around the filibuster  —   one that will be familiar to those who have closely followed the health care debate. For years, conservatives in Congress have been eyeing the pieces of   that can be repealed through budget reconciliation, a process that only requires a simple majority vote in the Senate (if the changes follow a complicated set of rules related to spending). This poses the biggest danger to financial reform in the next year.    Where financial regulations are concerned, Republicans’ top targets may surprise you. Many knowledgeable observers, such as Ben Bernanke, point to the ability of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to take over and   a financial firm on the eve of collapse  —   an ability created by    —   as a signal achievement of financial reform. Such powers would have prevented Lehman Brothers from going into bankruptcy in an uncontrolled manner, as it did in 2008, and would have thereby taken significant stress off the financial system. Yet these powers are in the crosshairs.  Many also argue that the risks of lending and borrowing among investment banks in the capital markets  —     “shadow banking”  —   carry the potential to produce panics, runs, and other crises. Regulators have made progress in limiting such risks. Yet Republicans want to bring this kind of oversight to a halt.  Republicans love to hate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau The biggest target of all, however, is likely to be the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was created to ensure that consumers have a dedicated financial regulator on their side. In its short life, the CFPB has been a remarkable success. It was essential in extracting a $100 million settlement from Wells Fargo for creating fake accounts for its customers that they did not want, then charging them fees for those accounts. It has provided billions of dollars in relief through legal actions against companies that used deceptive practices to sell financial products.     Perhaps most importantly, the bureau has brought transparency and accountability to previously opaque markets like consumer credit reporting, making clear just how much putting that new computer on your credit card will cost you in the long run. It has clarified for consumers the fine print aggressively wielded by nonbank debt collectors, mortgage and student debt servicers, and   colleges. These are markets where consumers are often not in a position to rectify injustices themselves. Conservatives have argued, however, that the CFPB is unaccountable and     —   that it lacks any of the administrative checks that accompany other regulatory agencies. Rep. Jeb Hensarling ( ) chair of the House Financial Services Committee, has called it the “most powerful and least accountable” agency in American history. That’s the same exact wording used by Mitt Romney while running for President in in 2012. But this supposed unaccountability is a canard. The CFPB is structured exactly like the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) another banking regulator  —   one that the CFPB is designed to complement and counterbalance. Like the Comptroller of the Currency, the CFPB has a single director, a dedicated funding stream, and a clear mission.  The similarity between the two regulatory agencies is no accident. (Indeed, the Senate Report on the   Act says the CFPB’s policies and “provisions are modeled on similar statutes governing the Office of the Comptroller. ”) In the   to the financial crisis, the OCC and other federal regulators put bank profitability over safeguards for consumers. The CFPB wields a similar level of powers but has a mandate to fight for consumers. It was unclear whether President Trump would fire CFPB Director Richard Cordray upon taking office. The legal case to do so was nonexistent, though many prominent Republicans encouraged him to. For now, Cordray has his job, which is set to naturally end in July of 2018, though the CFPB is still a target. We can expect Republicans to use reconciliation to dramatically reduce the budget, and by extension the effectiveness, of the CFPB. A move to keep “shadow banking” in the shadows The next target for Republicans will be the mechanism we have for dealing with risks posed by the overall financial sector. One of the lessons of the financial crisis is that it’s possible for the risks associated with traditional banking  —   panics, bank runs, and cascading failures of institutions  —   to be present in activities and institutions that aren’t traditional banks.     In the aftermath of Lehman Brothers’ collapse, investors in money market mutual funds, for instance, began rapidly pulling their funds. Soon, money market funds with no known Lehman exposure were having panics; in one week, investors in such funds withdrew $349 billion. This was the beginning of an It’s a Wonderful Life style banking run, but one that was in the capital markets of Wall Street instead of your neighborhood bank. Rapid deregulation had led to a situation in which large commercial banks like Citigroup had investment banking subsidiaries within them that were poorly regulated relative to traditional banking.   has fought for a consistent and clear regulatory regime for this type of credit creation. Republicans, however, don’t share this goal: The American Enterprise Institute recently ran a headline flatly stating “Shadow banks are not a source of systemic risk. ” Republicans plan on instituting    regulation reflecting that assumption.  The way Republicans plan on achieving this dubious goal is by reducing the funding for the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) a council of regulators whose job is to monitor the financial system, while also slashing the budget of the newly created Office for Financial Research (OFR). The Financial Stability Oversight Council requires financial firms that pose an unusually high risk of collapse, panic, and uncertainty to the economy to follow tougher regulations  —   including straightforward regulations followed by regular commercial banks. Republicans will also weaken the FSOC by appointing people to the council who share the ideology that there are no special risks in this sector. This upcoming attack is unfortunate because, as Amias Gerety, former Treasury assistant secretary for Financial Institutions under President Obama, describes in a recent paper, there’s been significant progress in reducing systemic banking risks. Bets that were hidden off the balance sheet of major financial firms have been put back on the books, making them clearer to investors and forcing banks to fund themselves with enough capital to handle the attendant risks.  New capital requirements require firms to have enough liquid funds to survive a crisis and make required payments to other firms. The riskier money market funds have been reorganized so they now have a value that fluctuates, which reduces the incentives for investors to be the first out the door like they did after Lehman failed. (Before, investors tended to bolt when money market funds “broke the buck”  —   when the share of a fund purchased per dollar dipped below $1. The new system makes it clearer that such funds, which tend to have low risk and low returns, aren’t guarantees.) However, by going after the funding of the regulators designed to handle future risks in capital markets, progress could be stopped dead.    Some institutions are indeed “too big to fail. ” But that doesn’t fit GOP ideology. Republicans will also try to use budget reconciliation to kill the funding and emergency powers given to the FDIC to deal with a failing financial institution, should the Lehman Brothers scenario recur. One reason is that many influential Republicans think, once again, that there’s simply no systemic problem that needs fixing. When Financial Services Committee Chair Jeb Hensarling introduced his CHOICE Act to roll back   he answered a question about the “too big to fail” issue by saying that letting big banks fail, as the government did in the case of Lehman, posed no problems: “Although it was painful, and somewhat chaotic, in many respects, those in the bankruptcy arena would tell you, the Lehman bankruptcy, to some extent, worked as it should have worked. ” But there are good reasons why we shouldn’t simply let financial institutions like Lehman Brothers go bankrupt, especially during a crisis. Bankruptcy is slow while a financial crisis is quick. Bankruptcy isn’t designed to stop financial runs or keep operations running, and it is certainly not designed to quickly coordinate across the vast complexity of financial firms that exist in dozens of countries.  Access to a secure line of funding is necessary to keep crucial banking functions running  —   and that can be difficult to secure during a bankruptcy, especially if the financial markets are chaotic. A random bankruptcy judge won’t have any experience with the financial firm in advance. What’s more, both the bankruptcy judge and Congress will face huge political pressure to resort to bailouts to prevent a crisis. To handle this,   provides the FDIC with a special power to take over and gradually shutter financial firms in case of emergencies.  It’s called Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) which oversees what Barney Frank calls “death panels for banks. ” Such liquidations are designed to function in some ways like bankruptcies, but they’re executed by regulators, who will have great familiarity with the industry and the firm. They can be done on the eve of a failure, which prevents managers from gambling to try to fix themselves  —   creating new problems that put the financial system at risk.  The FDIC can adjudicate claims quickly under this receivership, including putting a hold on derivatives and other complicated financial instruments. It can create a bridge company that allows for the transfer important entities to a new company. By targeting the parent company of a financial firm’s structure and forcing it to prepare for failure in advance, it can handle international scale and complex scope of financial institutions in a way bankruptcy cannot.     The liquidation authority has a dedicated funding stream that allows the FDIC to borrow against the failing firm’s assets in a time of crisis. Though taxpayer money is always recovered first by statute, the CBO scored this power as having a budgetary cost. This score is controversial because CBO assumed money would be lent within the   period but not recovered until afterward. Thus, under the complex reconciliation rules, Republicans can change and perhaps remove this power.   can be weakened through neglect, and the regulators President Trump puts into place are certainly likely to try that strategy. But the main danger is funding. Paul Ryan’s goal in the next two years is to recreate the federal government using a narrow majority and Senate budget rules to dodge the filibuster. This approach is dangerous when it comes to financial reform, because instead of creating a system that works for the overall economy, the proposals may well amount to a    of whatever fits this procedural trick.  Rapid change is the strength of this approach, but it would be rapid change in a direction that hurts consumers  —   and it makes a repeat of the 2007 to 2008 financial meltdown more likely.

{"article": "A new service award recently created by U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for Border Patrol agents could actually put their lives at risk. The award recognizes an agent who does not use deadly force in a situation where they are confronted by an armed assailant. [“They want us to put ourselves in a bad tactical situation,” National Border Patrol Council Vice President Shawn Moran told Breitbart Texas in an interview Friday evening. “This could lead to one of our agents getting killed. ”  The award is defined by the CBP as: The Use of Deadly Force Encounter Averted award is to recognize and employee who demonstrated clear situational awareness and courage while disarming a suspect using contact controls and verbal commands before the situation escalated to the use of deadly force. The act must demonstrate courage in the face of an armed suspect and result in no injury in accordance with agencies use of force policy. “At first, I thought this was a joke,” Moran told Breitbart Texas. But Border Patrol Agent Chris Cabrera contacted officials in the awards section of CBP and they confirmed it is true, he said. In addition to his Border Patrol duties Cabrera also serves as vice president of NBPC Local 3307 and as NBPC deputy spokesperson. “This is a true indication about how the politically appointed leaders of the CBP truly feel about our agents,” he said. Moran said he had not heard about the award before Cabrera brought it to his attention. “I can’t recall any official discussions between the union and the department over this,” he explained. “This is typical pandering by our executives to organizations like the ACLU and illegal alien advocates. ” The exacerbated leader of the NBPC which represents more than 18, 000 men and women who protect our nation’s borders said, “They are more concerned about placating these groups than protecting Border Patrol agents. ” He said this is also typical for them to roll something like this out on the day before a big holiday weekend hoping no one will notice. The policy appears to put just one more thing an agent must think about when faced with a life threatening situation. The NBPC posted a copy of the award definition on its Facebook page earlier on Friday evening. Commenting on the award, the organization posted, “This type of thinking will get Border Patrol agents killed. If that happens we will hold the creators of this award accountable. This is despicable. ” The CBP seems to be following the lead of the Los Angeles Police Department who rolled out a “Preservation of Life Award. ” The policy was designed to recognize officers who hold their fire to avoid using deadly force, Breitbart News’ William Bigelow reported in November 2015. The Los Angeles Police Protective League had a similar reaction to that of the NBPC. The local police union responded that the award prioritizes the lives of suspected criminals over the lives of officers. NATO forces in Europe considered a similar idea but never implemented it, Bigelow reported. Moran told Breitbart Texas his organization plans on contacting CBP officials after the Memorial Day weekend.

{"article": "INDIANAPOLIS  —   Now that the losing streak is over, Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek had a new dilemma: how to divvy up minutes at point guard after undrafted rookie Ron Baker led an unlikely   comeback in Milwaukee that ended the Knicks’   slide Friday. Derrick Rose, whom Hornacek had critiqued earlier Friday, sat out the entire fourth quarter in the   stunner in Milwaukee  . “I believe in my teammates,” said Rose, who shot    against the Bucks. “He made a decision to go with Ron. As a teammate, I can’t get mad at that. Ron works his [butt] off, so I understand. ” Asked if it was weird to sit the fourth, Rose said, “A little. We were in desperate mode. We just needed a win. Hopefully that will   something. ’’         Baker is here for the duration. The Knicks needed to waive Baker by Saturday night to have him clear waivers before the Jan. 10 deadline, otherwise his contract is guaranteed for the year. If there was any doubt, Baker’s performance Friday sealed it. “At the beginning of the year, I had a meeting with Jeff and he had mentioned something about January,’’ Baker said. “If I stayed on the right path as I did in preseason, I’ll be fine. I wasn’t concerned after that meeting, but I’m trying to keep improving obviously. ’’ The easiest thing to do is put Baker, an undrafted rookie out of Wichita State, back into his   role he has had essentially all season  —   except one night in Phoenix, where he also led a   rally before being yanked for Brandon Jennings late. Jennings, after a solid first month and a half, has seen his play drop of late. Baker notched six points, four assists, no turnovers and made big free throws in his   gem, coming in with the club down 13 points. Baker also drew an important late charge. “Obviously he’s really proud of my effort in the fourth quarter,’’ Baker said. Baker has been a favorite of Hornacek’s since the Knicks signed him after he went undraft. Baker told The Post   as both were lightly regarded shooting guards who spent four years in college. Asked the similarities, Hornacek said Saturday night: “I had bad hair, too. We’re both guys coming in the league  —   nothing flashy, getting guys in the right spots, realizing your role is getting guys the ball who need it. When I came to the league, I had Walter Davis, Alvin Adams, I knew I’m going to get it to one of these guys. When Ron gets in there, he gets it to Carmelo and KP and makes the right play. He’s a smart, heady guy. I don’t have to call plays when he has the ball. He’s smart enough to just do that. ’’ Told about the bad hair comment, the   Baker said, “I’m not going to agree with that quote. ’’ Hornacek likes how Baker orchestrates the offense and that the club can run more triangle sets with him at point, as opposed to Rose, whose major attribute is penetrating for buckets. However, Rose’s recent low shooting percentage  —   without the benefit of drawing fouls  —   has concerned Hornacek. When Rose drives and misses, he’s out of the play, and teams usually score in transition. Hornacek went as far as saying “95 percent’’ of Rose’s misses turn into baskets the other way. “Obviously, whenever my name is called, that’s the opportunity,’’ Baker said. “I can’t check myself into the game. It’s up to the coaching staff. I’m a team guy. There’s different matchups each and I just have to prepare the best I can. ’’", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> INDIANAPOLIS — Now that the losing streak is over, Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek had a new dilemma: how to divvy up minutes at point guard after undrafted rookie Ron Baker led an unlikely comeback in Milwaukee that ended the Knicks’ slide Friday.

The president took to Twitter on January 26 and said if Mexico refuses to pay for the wall then “it would be better to cancel an upcoming meeting” with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. Damon says he hopes the people of Mexico know that most Americans don’t support building a security wall on the U. S.  border. “We’ve got to watch, but hopefully the people of Mexico understand that the people of our country, the majority of them don’t believe that we should be putting any walls up. ” However, most Americans support Trump’s plan to build a border wall, according to a recent Rasmussen poll.

{"article": " Yum Brands Inc’s ( ) U. S. KFC chain plans to curb the use of antibiotics in its chicken supply, making it the last of the big three chicken restaurants to join the fight against the rise of dangerous   bacteria known as superbugs. KFC, the   U. S. chicken chain by sales after privately held    is giving its U. S. poultry suppliers until the end of 2018 to stop using antibiotics important to human medicine.  Some 70 percent of antibiotics vital for fighting infections in humans are sold for use in meat and dairy production and medical researchers have concerns that overuse of those drugs may diminish their effectiveness in fighting disease in humans. McDonald’s Corp’s ( ) roughly 14, 000 U. S. restaurants last year stopped serving chicken raised with antibiotics considered important to human medicine. Its Chicken McNuggets are a top seller and the change put pressure on the rest of the industry to follow.    is going a step further, vowing in 2014 to switch to poultry raised without any antibiotics at all by the end of 2019. Given its stature, KFC had been the focus of several antibiotic reduction campaigns by consumer, health and environment groups in addition to a coalition of British and U. S. shareholders with more than $2 trillion in assets under management. ”We recognize that it’s a growing public health concern,”   KFC U. S. President Kevin Hochman told Reuters on Thursday.  ”This is something that’s important to many of our customers and it’s something we need to do to show relevance and modernity within our brand,” Hochman said.  The policy applies only to KFC in the United States and its 4, 200 restaurants supplied by some 2, 000 domestic chicken farms, said Hochman. KFC’s antibiotic policy is set on a    basis, he added. Yum spun off its   China division in November.  ’GREAT NEWS FOR FRIED CHICKEN LOVERS’ Vijay Sukumar, chief food innovation officer for KFC U. S. said the new policy applies throughout the bird’s full life cycle, which includes the hatchery where chicks are sometimes injected with antibiotics while still in the shell.  Using data from a 2017 WATT PoultryUSA survey, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) estimates that more than 42 percent of the U. S. chicken industry is either under an antibiotics stewardship pledge or has already converted to responsible practices.  KFC’s new policy will likely move the number even higher, said Lena Brook, a food policy advocate at the NRDC, who noted that the estimate includes ”raised without antibiotics” pledges as well as ”raised without medically important” antibiotics pledges from producers like Tyson Foods Inc ( ) Perdue Farms and others. ”It’s great news for fried chicken lovers, and most importantly it’s great news for public health,” Brook said. ”Their commitment is one that we’ve been waiting for.”  Human infections from   bacteria pose a grave threat to global health and are estimated to kill at least 23, 000 Americans each year, although a recent Reuters investigation found that many   deaths are going uncounted. Hochman said the policy change has been in the works for a year. It will add some incremental cost that KFC plans to manage rather than pass on in the form of menu price increases, he said. At least some of KFC suppliers are already well on their way to compliance.  Tyson, the largest U. S. poultry producer and a KFC supplier, has announced plans to eliminate the use of human antibiotics in its chicken flocks by September 2017. Yum’s Taco Bell chain already committed to serve chicken raised without antibiotics important to human medicine in all U. S. restaurants by the end of last month. Its Pizza Hut division has the same rules for pizza toppings.

Jason Rapert told reporters. ”And today we have now, through the support of people all over the country, mostly from Arkansas, been able to erect this monument at zero taxpayer expense.” In 2015, the Arkansas Legislature passed   legislation that paved the way for the monument. The Ten Commandments Monument Display Act requires the Secretary of State to permit and arrange for the monument. The law cites the Supreme Court’s 2005 Van Orden v. Perry decision, which allowed the Texas State Capitol to keep its Ten Commandments monument in place. Nonetheless, the Arkansas law anticipates legal challenges: ”In the event that the legality or constitutionality of the monument . .. is challenged in a court of law,” it says, the Attorney General may either ”prepare and present a legal defense of the monument” or hire Liberty Institute to do so. The American Heritage and History Foundation, an organization founded by Rapert, raised the money to pay for the monument. Rapert says he is on the foundation’s board and that he makes no money from it. The ACLU of Arkansas says it will sue to remove the monument from the Capitol grounds. ”At a time when we do not need any more religious conflict and divisiveness in the world and in this country, it violates the First Amendment promise of religious liberty to all,” Rita Sklar, the group’s executive director, told NPR. ”By placing a monument to a particular set of religious beliefs, it appears that the state enforces one particular set of beliefs over others and over no religion. And it makes people who fall into those categories  —   no religion or other religion  —   feel like   citizens in the state of Arkansas, which they are not.” The monument suggests that the Commandments are the basis for American and Arkansas law, she says, even though ”several of the commandments are wholly religious in nature, like ’having no other gods before me,’ or keeping the Sabbath. Those have no purpose in U. S. or Arkansas law.” Rapert has made headlines with his legislation before. In 2013, he sponsored the country’s strictest abortion law, which was eventually blocked by a federal appeals court. And earlier this year, he sponsored a bill to take Bill and Hillary Clinton’s names off the Little Rock airport. Does Rapert believe in a separation of church and state? ”We have freedom of religion, that’s not freedom from religion,” he tells NPR. ”You have to remember, the State of Arkansas, through a legal process, said that they want to have a monument to the Ten Commandments for the Capitol grounds.” He calls the expected lawsuit by the ACLU ”foolhardy.” ”The ACLU has a history of what I call frivolous lawsuits. It’s very sad in this day and time,” he says. ”The Supreme Court of the United States has said these monuments don’t violate the Establishment Clause. This is America, and if they want to spend their money on this, they can do that. But it’s not the right thing to do.” Sklar says the ACLU of Arkansas has won similar battles over the Ten Commandments in classrooms and courtrooms, and she says the Van Orden decision doesn’t protect the new monument at the state capitol, either. The court distinguishes between longstanding, historically significant buildings, she says, ”that have had religious monuments or symbols for decades and decades, which is the case in Texas, and erecting a completely new religiously divisive monument [like that at] the Arkansas State Capitol. The Court sees a huge difference between the two, and so do we.” And she says that it’s Arkansas lawmakers who are wasting money  —   taxpayer money. ”It cost the state hundreds of thousands of dollars when we challenged their abortion ban. Talk about foolhardy.” Sklar says the Ten Commandments monument does what she believes Rapert and others intend: to assert ”that Christianity in part has some special place in American tradition, has a higher place, has a more important role.” ”It does what it sets out to do, which is to get people from other religions to feel unwanted and unequal.”", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> Little Rock, Ark. is the latest front in the ongoing battle over Ten Commandments monuments on government property.

{"article": "In February, during New York Fashion Week, the audience at the Hood by Air show had a “moment,” one of those rare shocks that jolt you out of your catwalk stupor and stick with you long after the lights have dimmed. It came courtesy of a model named Hirakish, who careened down the runway in a   suit and spiky   bootees, and who proceeded to go   and to spend the rest of the show running in and out of the stands, interrupting other models’ struts and otherwise joyfully, and challengingly, sticking his   feet in our faces. I thought of this on Thursday when the news came that Prince Rogers Nelson, the diminutive musician with the oversize talent, had died. Unlike David Bowie, another musical icon who recently passed away, Prince was not often   by designers as a collection reference. Though fashion played a big part in his image, as the many slide shows making their way around cyberspace attest, and though he made a surprise guest appearance in 2007 at Matthew Williamson’s 10th anniversary show, serenading the attendees and grinding with dancers and models (as one of the attendees, I can tell you, that was another “moment”) he wasn’t a   aesthetic inspiration. Prince refused to adhere to genres in clothing, just as he refused to adhere to genres in music, which meant he tended to ooze into the designer imagination, instead of immediately leaping to mind. But in the way he assumed the tropes of kitsch femininity  —   lace, ruffles, sequins, peekaboo and high heels  —   and transformed them into the vehicles of an    masculine sex appeal, Prince had enormous influence. Most of which can be summed up by the shoe. The high heel was the   of his wardrobe for the four decades he was in the public eye, the consistent base upon which he layered all sorts of style and character changes. Prince wore heels when he barely wore anything at all (just bikini bottoms and a trench coat) he wore them in “Purple Rain” and with baroque brocade he paired them with pastel suits,     jumpsuits he wore them with white hippie tunics at Coachella and slinky metallic gold at the Grammys he wore them offstage, out to dinner in Sweden in 2013, and, according to Mike Tyson’s memoir, “Undisputed Truth,” to play basketball. He wore them so much that there were rumors he needed hip surgery. And he wore them, he said, not because he wanted to be taller, but because “women like ’em. ” He wore them as they were originally designed to be worn, as demonstrated in “Standing Tall,” an exhibition last year at the Bata Shoe Museum in Toronto about men in high heels: as an expression of power and privilege reserved for male royalty, and only later   by women in the 17th and 18th centuries. It made some sense. His name, after all, was Prince. And in doing so  —   in wearing them so regularly, unapologetically (he did not hide behind the acceptably masculine heels of cowboy boots) and effectively  —   he transformed the idea of men in heels to possibility from joke. On women, heels suggest sex Prince showed they could function the same way for men. It is a meaningful part of the equation that has added up to the current trend toward gender fluidity in fashion. Which, let’s face it, really means men in women’s wear, since women have been borrowing from men’s wear for decades. Put another way: There was Prince, and then there was Hedi Slimane’s fall 2015 men’s wear show for Saint Laurent, with its   heels the heels in the men’s wear collections of Rick Owens and Gareth Pugh (and Hood by Air) and the black velvet midcalf heeled boots Kanye West wore in Paris last year, to name just some examples. In the end, his shoes were, as Prince once sang, a sign o’ the times.", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> In February, during New York Fashion Week, the audience at the Hood by Air show had a “moment,” one of those rare shocks that jolt you out of <span class=\"technique8\" id=\"row0annotation1\" technique8=\"0.68\"> your catwalk stupor and </span><sup class=\"technique8\" id=\"row0annotation1\">8</sup> stick with you long after the lights have dimmed.

{"article": "PIGEON FORGE, Tenn.  —   Deadly wildfires ripped through the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains in Tennessee on Monday night and Tuesday, forcing thousands to flee as emergency responders sought to contain a blaze that conjured biblical comparison. “Everywhere you looked, there were fires everywhere. It was like driving into hell,” said Rain Moore, 32, a lieutenant with the Sneedville Fire Department, about an hour and a half away. Mr. Moore said he arrived early Tuesday and, while fighting the fire in the darkness, saw orange flames burning from the center of trees, indicating a strong intensity. Fueled by high winds and a drought in Tennessee, the fires damaged about 150 buildings and forced thousands to evacuate. Three people died and 14 others were injured, officials said Tuesday afternoon. More than 14, 000 people left Gatlinburg, and others were evacuated from nearby Pigeon Forge as well as other parts of Sevier County, in the eastern part of the state, according to the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency. More than 10, 000 people had been left without power in Sevier County. “This is the largest fire in the last hundred years of the state of Tennessee,” Gov. Bill Haslam said on Tuesday afternoon. Dramatic videos shot by residents and shared online showed flames lining the edge of the highways used for evacuations. The fires, the result of human error, started in Great Smoky Mountains National Park and were spread by winds that reached 87 miles per hour on Monday night. Greg Miller, the chief of the Gatlinburg Fire Department, said the authorities expected winds of about 60 m. p. h. overnight Tuesday, but were hopeful that rain would come first. Officials did not say how the three who died were killed. Gatlinburg’s mayor, Mike Werner, was among those who lost his home, he said on Tuesday. He also lost his business of more than three decades. “It’s a devastating time for us and for Gatlinburg,” he said. “But, as I said earlier this morning, we’re strong, we’re resilient and we’re going to make it. ” By early Tuesday evening, a thick,   haze cut visibility in Gatlinburg to only a few city blocks. The fire had hopscotched around the resort town of 3, 900 people and 60, 000 hotel beds, flattening some buildings while leaving others next door or around the block untouched. Emergency vehicles, lights flashing, cruised past   cars and gutted businesses as a city spokeswoman took reporters on a tour of the destruction. The town, located at the base of Great Smoky Mountains National Park about 50 miles from Knoxville, relies heavily on tourism. Pigeon Forge, home to Dolly Parton’s Dollywood theme park, is among the premier tourist destinations in the region. On Twitter, the National Park Service announced that officials had “closed all facilities in the park due to the extensive fire activity, and downed trees. ” Pete Owens, a spokesman for Dollywood, said in a statement that the park had not been damaged but that more than a dozen cabins managed by the company had been damaged or destroyed. Ms. Parton said she was “heartbroken” by the destruction: “I am praying for all the families affected by the fire and the firefighters who are working so hard to keep everyone safe. ” The fires spread through Tennessee as much of the South has been enduring a crippling drought, even though rainfall this week offered some relief. The United States Drought Monitor reported last week that 60 percent of Tennessee was in “exceptional” or “extreme” drought, the two most severe ratings. Wildfires, once a seasonal phenomenon, have become a consistent threat, partly because climate change has resulted in drier winters and warmer springs, which combine to pull moisture off the ground and into the air. The authorities closed Route 321 at the Rocky Top Sports World, barring access into downtown Gatlinburg. About 700 people gathered on Tuesday morning inside the complex’s main building, a   center on the   campus: mountain men with gray beards and canes alongside several people in blue surgical masks. One man was too choked up to talk, his tiny   bull mix shaking inside his battered camouflage jacket. Dozens of Red Cross volunteers and firefighters tended to people who seemed shellshocked. “I got my family, man,” said Greg Lanham, 36, who fled the flames around 8 p. m. Monday with his wife, Kara, 32, and their three children. The family moved from Henderson, Tenn. three months ago. Mr. Lanham, a maintenance worker, and Ms. Lanham, a maid, both worked at Sidney James Mountain Lodge, which survived the fire but remains closed. “We didn’t know what to do,” Mr. Lanham said. “We took what little money we had in our pockets and found a place to stay. ” The family did manage to save their dogs, Gizmo, a Pekingese, and Scruffy, a   Russell mix, along with their kitten, Snowball. Standing at the sports complex’s food counter, where Red Cross volunteers served free coffee, hot dogs, burgers and fries, and boxes of fried chicken, Ms. Lanham joined her family and, crying, told her husband: “It’s gone. It’s all gone. ” “We did lose everything,” Mr. Lanham said. “We got the clothes on our back. ”", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> PIGEON FORGE, Tenn. — Deadly wildfires ripped through the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains in Tennessee on Monday night and Tuesday, forcing thousands to flee as emergency responders sought to contain a blaze that conjured biblical comparison. “Everywhere you looked, there were fires everywhere.

{"article": "”This storm is a monster,” Gov. Rick Scott said at an evening news conference. ”Matthew is likely to produce devastating impacts along portions of the east coast tonight,” he added. As it moved north in the evening, Matthew stayed about 100 miles or more off South Florida, sparing the 4. 4 million people in the Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas from its most punishing effects.  ”We were lucky this time,”   Mayor Carlos Gimenez said. By Thursday night, more than 60, 000 homes and businesses were without power. Streets in Vero Beach were partially covered with water, and hotel guests in Orlando were told to stay inside, though a few sneaked out to smoke or watch the rain. The hurricane was instead expected to blow ashore    or come dangerously close to doing so    early Friday north of West Palm Beach, which has about 1. 1 million people, and then slowly push north for the next 12 hours along the Interstate 95 corridor, through Cape Canaveral and Jacksonville, according to the National Hurricane Center. Forecasters said it would then probably hug the coast of Georgia and South Carolina over the weekend before veering out to sea    perhaps even looping back toward Florida in the middle of next week as a tropical storm. As of 10 p. m. EDT, Matthew was located 65 miles   of West Palm Beach, moving northwest at about 13 mph. As evening fell, the winds picked up along Vero Beach, midway between West Palm Beach and Cape Canaveral, stripping away palm fronds, ripping awnings and blowing sand that stung the face. Waves crashed on the beach, and rain came in short bursts. About 30, 000 homes and businesses were in the dark.  Officials from Florida to South Carolina urged an estimated 2 million people to evacuate. Scott said so far he has activated 3, 500 Florida National Guard members to assist in any rescues and recovery missions after the storm passed.  CLICK FOR INFORMATION ON CURRENT FLORIDA EVACUATION ORDERS, President Obama declared a state of emergency for Florida and South Carolina on Thursday, clearing the way for federal aid in addition to state and local emergency response teams. The Pentagon reported the governors of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina had mobilized 4, 500 National Guardsmen ahead of the hurricane. Forecasters said Matthew could dump up to 15 inches of rain in some spots and cause a storm surge of 9 feet or more. They said the major threat to the Southeast would not be the winds    which newer buildings can withstand    but the massive surge of seawater that could wash over coastal communities along a   stretch from South Florida to the Charleston, S. C. area.  The Fort Lauderdale airport shut down on Thursday morning, and further north the Orlando airport also closed. By     service FlightAware. com reported that nearly 1, 500 flights within the U. S. had been scrapped, with the largest numbers at Fort Lauderdale and Miami. American Airlines, which has a major hub in Miami, was the   carrier, followed by Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways. Amtrak suspended train service between Miami and New York, and cruise lines rerouted ships to avoid the storm, which in some cases will mean more days at sea. Workers transferred patients from two Florida waterfront hospitals and a nursing home near Daytona Beach to safer locations. Officials at Walt Disney World, Universal Studios and SeaWorld said the parks would shut down Thursday afternoon until the storm passes. Thousands of people hunkered down in schools converted to shelters, and inland hotels in places such as Charlotte, N. C. reported brisk business.  At the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, NASA no longer has to worry about rolling space shuttles back from the launch pad to the hangar because of hurricanes, since the shuttle fleet is now retired. But the spaceflight company SpaceX was concerned about the storm’s effect on its leased seaside pad. ”When a hurricane is forecast to take a track roughly parallel to a coastline, as Matthew is forecast to do from Florida through South Carolina, it becomes very difficult to specify impacts at any one location,” National Hurricane Center forecaster Lixion Avila said. The number of people killed in Haiti rose to at least 283, local officials told Reuters on Thursday, saying the storm killed at least four people elsewhere in the Caribbean. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal ordered an evacuation of the state’s entire coast, covering more than a   people. It was the first hurricane evacuation along the Georgia coast since 1999, when the state narrowly escaped Floyd.  The last Category 3 storm or higher to hit the U. S. was Wilma in October 2005. It sliced across Florida with 120 mph winds, killing five people and causing an estimated $21 billion in damage. As people hurried to higher ground, authorities in South Carolina said a motorist died on Wednesday after being shot by deputies in a gun battle that erupted when he sped away from a checkpoint along an evacuation route.  South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley reversed Interstate 26 so that all lanes of traffic were headed west and out of Charleston. It was the first time the lanes had been reversed. Plans to reverse the lanes were put in place after   traffic jams during Hurricane Floyd in 1999. Haley said Thursday night she’s ”begging” people to understand the seriousness of Matthew and evacuate the South Carolina coast. Haley said so far 280, 000 people had evacuated as of 3 p. m. Thursday, but that means hundreds of thousands more need to leave. The governor told reporters that forecasts are getting worse, but ”we can’t take you by the hand and bring you to the Upstate.” Medical facilities that have had to evacuate their patients include Beaufort Memorial Hospital. Haley said Thursday night that should be an indication of the seriousness. Authorities said the storm surge in some areas along the southern coast of South Carolina will exceed those when Hurricane Hugo hit the state in 1989. Haley said to ”imagine   ” storm surges, while eastern parts of the state could see 8 to 14 inches of rain. In Florida, Scott also lifted tolls on major roads. The Florida Turnpike, Alligator Alley and part of the Central Florida Expressway Authority and the   Expressway Authority had toll services suspended, according to Fox 35 Orlando. In Melbourne Beach, near the Kennedy Space Center, Carlos and April Medina moved their paddle board and kayak inside the garage and took pictures off the walls of their home about 500 feet from the coast. They moved the pool furniture inside, turned off the water, disconnected all electrical appliances and emptied their refrigerator. They then hopped in a truck filled with legal documents, jewelry and a decorative carved shell that had once belonged to April Medina’s   and headed west to Orlando, where they planned to ride out the storm with their daughter’s family. ”The way we see it, if it maintains its current path, we get tropical   winds. If it makes a little shift to the left, it could be a Category 2 or 3 and I don’t want to be anywhere near it,” Carlos Medina said. ”We are just being a little safe, a little bit more cautious.” About 20 miles away in the town of Cape Canaveral, John Long said Hurricane Matthew is just hype as his neighbors in his RV park packed up and evacuated inland. Even though his   RV is just feet from the Banana River and a half mile from the beach, he had no plans to leave. Long, who owns a bike shop and has lived along the Space Coast for 30 years, said he has a generator and enough food and water for himself and his cats to last a week. ”There’s always tremendous buildup and then it’s no stronger than an afternoon thunderstorm,” he said. ”I’m not anticipating that much damage.” At Folly Beach, S. C. southwest of Charleston, Gaby Trompeter loaded her car at her beachfront home preparing to evacuate to Augusta, Georgia. Trompeter, a    goldsmith who designs and makes jewelry, remembers Hurricane Hugo when she stayed in Savannah, Georgia, in 1989. A year ago when what has been described as a   flood inundated South Carolina there was so much water on the road near her house she couldn’t get out for three days. ”If it brings a lot of rain, more than the storm last year, why would I want to stay?” she said. On the Georgia coast,    Lou Arcangeli saw two of his adult children come to his home on Tybee Island to help prepare and evacuate if necessary. ”It’s serious,” said Arcangeli, who has lived in the Savannah area since 1979, when Hurricane David became the last hurricane to make landfall on Georgia’s   coast. ”I’m going to keep an eye on it and not wait until the last minute. As far as I’m concerned, what’s going to happen is going to happen.” ”We have a house that sits right here on the water and we kind of said goodbye to it thinking that, you know, the house . .. might not be here when we get back,” said Jennifer Banker, a resident of Georgia’s dangerously exposed St. Simons Island. ”You know, we pray a lot and trust God to provide.” Some coastal residents in Georgia and beyond decided to take their chances and stay. Darcy O’Connor, a restaurant owner who lives in a rowhouse in Savannah, Ga. a historic city of many beautifully maintained homes from the 18th and 19th century, said she and her most of her neighbors were sticking around. O’Connor noted that her home, built in 1883, has weathered hurricanes before: ”Half the windows, if you look, still have the original glass. So that tells you something.” Farmers in Matthew’s path scrambled to protect their crops. In South Carolina, Jeremy Cannon was harvesting his soybeans a week early after waiting too long before last year’s record rainstorm. He watched his soybeans and cotton crops slowly drown as 20 inches of rain fell, costing him $800, 000. ”I don’t want to lose a single soybean this year if I don’t have to,” Cannon said. ”The Lord says pray without ceasing. And that’s what I’ve been doing  —   in the fields, near the barn  —   just praying all the time.

Rick Scott said at an evening news conference. ”Matthew is likely to produce devastating impacts along portions of the east coast tonight,” he added. As it moved north in the evening, Matthew stayed about 100 miles or more off South Florida, sparing the 4. 4 million people in the Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas from its most punishing effects. ”We were lucky this time,” Mayor Carlos Gimenez said. By Thursday night, more than 60, 000 homes and businesses were without power. Streets in Vero Beach were partially covered with water, and hotel guests in Orlando were told to stay inside, though a few sneaked out to smoke or watch the rain. The hurricane was instead expected to blow ashore or come dangerously close to doing so early Friday north of West Palm Beach, which has about 1. 1 million people, and then slowly push north for the next 12 hours along the Interstate 95 corridor, through Cape Canaveral and Jacksonville, according to the National Hurricane Center. </div>", "key": "63f2b986-48ec-11ec-b096-6e0781bad58a",

{"article": " AFTER HIS latest execrable tweets, it’s obvious that there is no point in urging President Trump to act with greater dignity, respect for his office or, for that matter,  . It isn’t going to happen. That makes it all the more urgent for the rest of us to think about how to safeguard civility and democratic values until his presidency ends. It would be wrong to say that Mr. Trump’s attacks on Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough Thursday were shocking, because his boorishness no longer can shock. But the hateful insults directed at the MSNBC   (and, in Mr. Scarborough’s case, Post columnist) did seem to take the capital city’s collective breath away. “Please just stop,” Republican Sen. Ben Sasse (Neb.) tweeted in response. “This isn’t normal and it’s beneath the dignity of your office. ” Many others chimed in, urging Mr. Trump to apologize, to stop tweeting or even (in a moment of extreme wishful thinking) to resign. Yes, Mr. Trump should apologize, he should stop tweeting insults, he should respect the awesome history of his office. Similarly, he should stop attacking the news media, which plays an important role in American democracy. He should take questions from the press more often, and he should answer truthfully. He should show more respect for women. He should, in short, act presidential, and he should continue to be urged to do so, not only by editorial pages but also by other leaders, especially in his own party, and by people in his administration. But assuming he remains immune to such importuning, what can the rest of us do? We’ve given this some thought in the context of international relations, because the world had become accustomed to looking to the United States as a defender of democracy, human rights and liberal values. Admittedly the nation has played this role imperfectly, with dollops of hypocrisy and inconsistency along the way. But from World War II until now, the United States had not been led by anyone espousing selfishness as a lodestar. And that has made it crucial for others to fill the gap  —   crucial for Congress, civil society and citizens across the nation to stand up for freedom and for the United States remaining a beacon of freedom across the globe. We’d say the same now about plain old courtesy and decorum. It may be beyond the power of any other politician to change Mr. Trump’s behavior. But all of us can model a different way of acting and interacting.       (Peter   Washington Post)   What gives us hope is the conviction that the American people are better than the misogyny and rudeness we see spewing from the White House. Our politics have always been rough and tumble, but most of us don’t want to see this kind of ugliness become the dominant trait. We should all be focused on preserving a little flame of decency so that, whenever the Trump era ends, that flame can be rekindled into the kind of discourse that would make the country proud again.

{"article": "During China’s recent “Two sessions,” in which some 5, 000 governing elites gathered in Beijing to   the agenda of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Wang Hongguang, a retired Chinese general, publicly dared the United States to deploy a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system (THAAD) in Taiwan. He boasted that the deployment would provide the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) with an excuse to use force to “liberate” the island. Wang had earlier dared the U. S. to deploy Marines to guard the site of the American Institute in Taiwan, the de facto American embassy on the island. He has threatened to use harsh countermeasures to retaliate against the government of Tsai   even though she had nothing to do with the decision to deploy the Marines in Taipei. Trump’s   on the One China policy has caused unnecessary confusion in Asia. It has weakened the administration’s moral position and credibility and has arguably given Beijing the upper hand in the   relationship. In my view, the One China policy is a trap that has been plied by Beijing to legitimize and strengthen the CCP dictatorship, squeeze Taiwan’s international space, and force Taiwan to kneel at Beijing’s feet. President Trump should take a fresh look at the One China policy, and honor the “right” China. In the late 1960s and early ’70s, President Nixon was anxious to get out of Vietnam and counter the Soviets’ global expansion during the Cold War. Henry Kissinger persuaded Nixon to betray and abandon the ROC  —   America’s   ally in Asia  —   by recognizing the PRC government as the sole legitimate government of China. Thus America willingly accepted the One China policy. In 1979, the U. S. Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act to maintain unofficial relations with the ROC. Later, President Reagan gave the “Six Assurances” for the ROC’s security, all of which were designed to keep the   status quo. Most American experts on China argue that this policy has worked well because it has helped maintain the regional peace. But I believe that the One China policy is seriously flawed and should be reviewed and modified. This policy has helped Beijing fundamentally shift the power balance in its favor, resulting in the creation of an authoritarian behemoth that impinges on the right of the Taiwanese people to   and that poses a severe threat to both regional and global peace. Beijing has demanded the recognition of One China as a prerequisite for entering into diplomatic relations and joining international organizations, and it has successfully excluded Taiwan from the current international system. This is unfair to the people of Taiwan. The ROC has always been an outstanding member of the international community. It made enormous sacrifices during World War II and great contributions to the Asian economic  . Even in the wake of America’s abandonment of Taiwan and Beijing’s relentless pressure, the ROC has peacefully transformed itself into a democratic country and become a beacon of freedom in Asia. By contrast, since the Communist regime in Beijing first entered the international community under the One China policy, it has taken advantage of American markets, capital, and technology to rise to its position as an evil empire. Instead of respecting international law and order, as Kissinger assured us it would, Beijing has sought to reshape the international order in ways that ensure the PRC’s dominance. The CCP brutally cracks down on any dissent by its citizens and also undermines international peace and stability by bullying countries in the region, including Taiwan. Worse, the regime even boasts about its capability to nuke America. Standing up for democracy has long been a core element of American foreign policy, not only because the U. S. has a moral obligation to support democratic countries that share the same values but also because such support will make America and the world more secure. The One China policy forced on Washington by Beijing has not been adjusted to take into account the ROC’s democratic governance. At the same time, an underlying assumption of the policy, namely, political reform and peaceful transition, has not materialized. In short, the policy is out of date and not in the   best interest of the U. S. and it should be updated accordingly. America’s difficulty in refining the ambiguous One China policy has over time allowed Beijing to hijack and distort the term. For example, the U. S. only acknowledged Beijing’s One China position in the 1972 first joint communiqué of the PRC and the U. S. without expressly accepting it. But in the 1979 joint communiqué of the PRC and the U. S. the U. S. recognized Beijing as the sole legitimate government of China, and further, in these nations’ third joint communiqué, in 1982, the U. S. was pushed to admit that it had no intention of pursuing a policy of “two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan. ” President Clinton went to so far as to state that the U. S. would not support Taiwan’s independence. Presidents Bush and Obama also took a similar position. Today, the PRC and America have, in practice, recognized of the One China policy as legitimate. Step by step, Beijing has fully cast its One China spell on the U. S. The grave danger caused by the United States’ ambiguous, often   statements and practice regarding One China is that they fail to draw a red line to guarantee Taiwan’s security in a legally binding agreement this could offer an opportunity for Beijing to invade the island in the future. The U. S. did not secure Beijing’s commitment to abandon the use of force against Taiwan. In 2005, the Communist regime passed the     law, explicitly stipulating that it will use force against Taiwan’s “independence provocation. ” But that term’s meaning remains totally subject to the regime’s interpretation. Today, more than a thousand missiles are pointing at the island across the Taiwan Strait, but Beijing considers it a serious “provocation” if the ROC even mentions THAAD as a possible means of defending itself from a potential attack, Even if the One China policy was justified 40 years ago, the geopolitical conditions calling for it no longer exist: The Soviet Union collapsed long ago, and the new Moscow has formed a strategic alliance with Beijing Vietnam now sides with the U. S. in opposing China’s aggressive behavior in the South China Sea, and the PRC has become a formidable power challenging America’s global leadership. I believe the best way to break the One China spell is for the U. S. to refuse to accept Beijing’s sovereignty over Taiwan and to formally recognize the ROC as a legitimate government by signing an agreement with it. The agreement should incorporate the updated and expanded components in the Taiwan Relations Act and President Reagan’s “Six Assurances” to reflect Taiwan’s democracy and America’s commitment to its defense. Such strategic and moral clarity will deter Beijing’s aggression and achieve peace through strength in the region. To conclude, I want to quote a fellow citizen of China: “As a mainland shitzen (sh** + citizen) I do not give a sh** who is in power, but I am happy to see Taiwan not be swallowed by the CCP, because it is far better to let some people live free than have us all suffer under slavery. ” I hope President Trump has this Chinese shitzen’s political wisdom to break the One China spell, which would help him make America greater.,", "sentence": {"content": "<div> During China’s recent “Two sessions,” in which some 5, 000 governing elites gathered in Beijing to the agenda of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Wang Hongguang, a retired Chinese general, publicly dared the United States to deploy a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system (THAAD) in Taiwan. He boasted that the deployment would provide the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) with an excuse to use force to “liberate” the island. Wang had earlier dared the U. S. to deploy Marines to guard the site of the American Institute in Taiwan, the de facto American embassy on the island. He has threatened to use harsh countermeasures to retaliate against the government of Tsai even though she had nothing to do with the decision to deploy the Marines in Taipei. Trump’s on the One China policy has caused unnecessary confusion in Asia. It has weakened the administration’s moral position and credibility and has arguably given Beijing the upper hand in the relationship.

{"article": "        RIO DE JANEIRO  ” As he struggles to build support for his presidency, Brazil s new leader, Michel Temer, has been dogged by the kind of character issue that pollsters refer to as  a strong negative. ? Temer, rumor has it, is a devil worshiper. The origins of this falsehood are unclear. Temer, 75, a longtime politician, is a Christian of Maronite Lebanese descent. But the rumors have inflicted enough damage that Temer turned to prominent evangelical pastors for help. They encouraged him to make a video appealing for evangelicals  support.  He did a beautiful video, ? said the Rev. Marco Feliciano, a congressman and Pentecostal leader, who appeared at his side in the recording.  He asked the church to pray for him. ? The prayers, and pacts with pastors such as Feliciano, have provided badly needed support to Temer and have given the country s growing evangelical movement unprecedented influence as Brazil goes through its biggest political upheaval in decades. Temer chose an evangelical bishop who believes in creationism to be his top science official and then made him trade minister. The new labor minister also is an evangelical pastor. Just as the Rev. Jerry Falwell s Moral Majority emerged as a force in the United States in the 1980s, Brazilian evangelical leaders have gone from the political sidelines to the center. Their movement is not a coordinated effort to take power, they insist, but a   backlash against secularism, homosexuality and changesÂ  introduced during 13 years of   Workers  Party rule. That era appeared to end this month when lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to suspend President Dilma Rousseff and put her on trial for allegedly breaking budget laws. Temer, Rousseff s former coalition partner turned political rival, became interim president and will serve out the rest of Rousseff s term through 2018 if she is found guilty. Temer enters office with a wobbly mandate. Even if most Brazilians don t think that he is a satanic figure, polls show that he is widely distrusted, with fewer than 10 ‰percent of citizens wanting him to be president, according to surveys.    Just as the late Rev. Jerry Falwell s Moral Majority emerged as a force in the United States in the 1980s, Brazilian evangelical leaders have gone from the political sidelines to the center, wielding more clout than ever before. (Dom Phillips, Jason  )   Temer has sought help from Christian evangelicals, who were some of the strongest backers of Rousseff s suspension. Of the 94 lawmakers from different parties who, according to Feliciano, form part of the  Evangelical Bloc ? in Brazil s lower chamber of Congress, 89 voted to put her on trial. Dozens dedicated their votes  to God ? in the nationally televised proceedings.  [Brazil s new leader is a poet and charmer  ” not a stodgy bureaucrat]  Brazilian evangelicals are not monolithic. They have no single leader. But in a country with more than 30 parties, the movement has benefited from a discipline otherwise lacking in Brazil s political culture of dealmaking and fleeting alliances of convenience, said Paulo BaÃ a, a political scientist and sociologist at Rio de Janeiro s Federal University.  They have more political influence than ever, and they are going through a moment in which they re asserting their power, ? BaÃ a said. The Evangelical Bloc has grown significantly since 2010, when it had an estimated 73 seats in Brazil s   lower house. Although divergent on economic issues, lawmakers in the bloc are overwhelmingly opposed to a 2013 decision, now under appeal to Brazil s Supreme Court, that recognized   marriage. They are also against the legalization of abortion. With a population of 205 ‰million, Brazil remains the world s largest Catholic nation. But 22 ‰percent of Brazilians identify as evangelical Christians, up from 5Â percent in 1970. Many evangelical pastors work in remote rural areas and in Brazil s violent slums, where the government is often absent. That gives pastors an unrivaled ability to mobilize voters at election time. And compared with Brazil s Catholic leaders, the evangelical pastors are more explicit about their political endorsements, BaÃ a said.  They speak clearly in favor of their candidates and even campaign for them, ? he said. A few have also studied on Christian campuses in the United States, including Liberty University, founded by Falwell, which encourages students to promote religious values through civic engagement, said Falwell s son Jerry, the university president.  Brazilian students are compatible with our students and with life in America, ? he said, speaking by phone from Lynchburg, Va. where the campus is located.  They find America similar to what they experience at home. ?     Members of the congregation sing during a service at televangelist Silas Malafaia s Victory in Christ temple. (Lianne   The Washington Post)  Many Brazilian evangelical leaders had initially supported the Workers  Party because of its focus on helping the poor; their votes helped its founder, Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, win the presidency in 2006 and 2010. But that pact fell apart during Rousseff s tenure because of the party s backing of a bill to prohibit homophobia and a law to allow the  morning after ? pill for rape victims, which evangelical leaders felt opened the door for abortion. Leading televangelist Silas Malafaia, one of Rousseff s harshest critics, said the source of the break was a disagreement about the role of the government in shaping Brazilian values.  What is their game? ? Malafaia asked in an interview.  To control the state. ?  We saw that communism was in their DNA, ? Malafaia said, speaking at his spacious home in a gated community on Rio s outskirts.  [With new Brazilian government, conservationists fear for the Amazon]  Malafaia, who was one of Brazil s pioneering televangelists in the 1980s, has more than 3 ‰million followers on his Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts, where he routinely skewers Rousseff and criticizes gay rights and feminism. He has been outspoken in his support of Temer as the leader of a government of  national salvation, ? and he recorded a video attempting to squelch the rumor that Temer is a closeted Satan lover. Malafaia s Victory in Christ temple in a rough section of Rio was packed with television cameras and thousands of worshipers on a recent night. Homosexuality is  prostitution ? and abortion is a sin, Malafaia told the congregation, which erupted in shouts of  amen ? and  hallelujah. ? Marcos Melo, 35, a member of Malafaia s church, said  spiritual problems ? were at the core of Brazil s many ills, from crime and political corruption to the worst economic downturn since the 1930s.  I believe that God is stepping in and lifting this immorality from the people, ? said Melo. Rousseff s suspension, he said,  was necessary for Brazil to heal. ?    Members of congregation worship through song at the Victory in Christ temple in Rio de Janeiro. (Lianne   The Washington Post)  Some of the evangelical figures who threw stones at Rousseff are facing legal troubles, including Eduardo Cunha, the former speaker of the lower house. Within weeks of presiding over a suspension vote against the president in April, Cunha was ordered to step down because he is under investigation for corruption and obstruction of justice. Temer has appointed AndrÃ© Moura, a congressman and a member of the Social Christian Party  ” an evangelical party  ” as his government s leader in the lower house. Moura is among those under investigation in a Supreme Court probe into corruption at   oil company Petrobras and also faces allegations that he was involved in crimes including conspiracy and attempted homicide in past years. He and Cunha have denied the allegations. Despite Brazil s image as a land of   bikinis and Carnival debauchery, evangelical leaders insist that it is a morally conservative country and say that Brazilian politics are beginning to reflect that.  Many evangelicals in Brazil see their country in much of the same way the evangelical right views the United States, ? said Andrew Chesnut, a Latin America expert and professor of religious studies at Virginia Commonwealth University.  They think the Workers  Party put Brazil on a path to moral ruin. It legalized gay marriage. It has given Brazil one of Latin America s highest   abortion rates, even though the procedure remains illegal. There s pornography all over the place. ?  A lot of Brazilians outside of major cities are fairly conservative morally, and the evangelical agenda resonates with them, ? Chesnut said.

{"article": "     The White House Correspondents’ Association dinner is not a mood ring. It doesn’t care if President Trump  —   or any president  —   likes, dislikes, celebrates, scorns or ignores White House reporters. The annual gala does not indicate, illustrate or represent the relationship between the White House and the reporters who cover it. It is an institution that celebrates one bedrock American value, the First Amendment, and two journalistic goals: to highlight excellent reporting and to award scholarships to the next generation of American journalists. That has always been true. But the Trump presidency has inspired some in the press corps to boycott this year because  —   if I have this right  —   reporters are too good for Trump. When asked why his outlet won’t be   its always   WHCA dinner   this year (and why he says he’s going fishing instead) Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter told the New York Times that his reasons were “Trump” and “the fish. ” The New Yorker is scrapping its own, very popular, correspondents’ dinner weekend kickoff party, as well. U. S. News & World Report’s Robert Schlesinger says “The media should go all the way and boycott the dinner entirely this year. ” Of Trump, The Washington Post’s Margaret Sullivan argues that it’s time to cancel the event because the press should not “be his prom date. ” But no   White House reporter has ever been a president’s prom date, and the dinner isn’t a date at all. It’s a   with bad wine and crowded tables. And if we, the media, stand Trump up at the proverbial dance because we’re pining for another “date,” we make it that much easier for him to say we’re playing favorites. And in this case, at least, he’d be right. The WHCA already has to defend itself against the “nerd prom” cliche  —   two hours of live TV every spring during which   and   journalists allegedly do nothing more than mingle with   celebrities. After that, so goes the tedious trope, reporters bow down before sources as supplicants. Never mind that the vast majority of WHCA members don’t receive an invitation to the dinner or the various receptions that take place before and after. Never mind that reporters, like everyone else, are capable of doing some work while dressed up and laughing at the hired comic or the president of the United States.   [I sat next to Donald Trump at the infamous 2011 White House correspondents’ dinner]   Consistency matters. The New York Times, among other organizations, has for several years chosen to ignore the dinner. Fair enough. Reasonable journalists can disagree. The suggestion, though, that holding the dinner during the Trump era would be an act of debasement, or that the advent of the Trump administration is the right moment to do away with the event altogether, strikes me as precisely the wrong approach. My outlet, CBS News, will participate this year and proudly so. If they back out now, organizations that attended last year ought to explain what is different about this year. Is it Trump? Or is it them? Skipping needlessly hands an evidentiary cudgel to Trump and his acolytes that reporters cannot and will not cover his presidency objectively. Yes, it might strike some as unseemly for reporters to attend a banquet where the keynote speaker is a president who calls the press “dishonest” purveyors of “fake news. ” But it would be even more unseemly, given our role, if we signaled to our readers, viewers and listeners that it is beneath us to pay Trump the same institutional respect extended to previous presidents. Besides, Trump is hardly the first president to see the press as his enemy. Other presidents have at times demonstrated contempt for journalists, limited our access, circumvented us and questioned our motives. I’ve covered three of them. Holding the dinner does not confer respect on any president. It aligns one institution, the WHCA, with another, the American presidency. If the dinner were canceled because (gasp!) a president made a few snide remarks about White House reporters, that act of   would say that the First Amendment is negotiable and that emotional   takes precedence over professional responsibilities. For myself and for my colleagues on the beat, let me say unequivocally: never. Let’s remember, finally, why we hold the dinner: The WHCA, backed by the Bill of Rights, fights daily for access to the most powerful figure in American politics  —   and thereby, the association hopes, encouraging reporters in state capitols, county commission offices and city halls to do the same. Events built around the dinner allow collegiate scholarship winners to ask questions of seasoned members of the White House press corps, learning from some of the best about how they might be better reporters, storytellers and writers. In my experience, interacting with these energetic, optimistic and creative souls has consistently revived my hopes for the craft of journalism and the durability of a free press. This was vital to me early in my career as a Washington reporter, and now I see it as a chance to give back. If Trump represents a genuine threat to press freedoms, then foregoing the dinner doesn’t change a thing. The right response, instead, is for reporters and news organizations to redouble their commitment to a WHCA dinner built around the journalism of the present and of the future.", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> The White House Correspondents’ Association dinner is not a mood ring.

and “the fish. ” The New Yorker is scrapping its own, very popular, correspondents’ dinner weekend kickoff </div>", "key": "57ff3c2e-48ee-11ec-a8d6-6e0781bad58a", "sentence_propaganda":

{"article": "Breitbart Tech   Milo Yiannopoulos joined Breitbart News Daily with host Breitbart News    Alex Marlow to discuss how progressives and social media networks are manipulating and censoring discussions and the news. [“Where do you think this is going to take the news world and the world in general, where are we getting our information, how is the landscape changing from your vantage point?” Marlow asked in reference to the media’s covering of stories.  “It’s not a hugely positive outlook, I’m sorry to say,” Yiannopoulos replied. “The mainstream media continues to move in this bizarre, sort of   distortion field direction, insisting on covering things up. And then when it becomes impossible to deny that, for example, marauding gangs of sexual molestation and rapists are from a particular place or a particular religion or arrived in the country in a particular way, then the story becomes about, ‘Oh it was the police covering it up, not us, not the media. ’” “They think people are so stupid, so idiotic,” he continued. “And the problem of course is that when you look at the means through which people can circumvent that system, social media, sharing information with each other about what actually happens as the press isn’t doing its job properly, you discover that almost every social network is in cahoots with national governments or is simply ideologically aligned with the progressive media to cover that stuff up. ” Yiannopoulos noted that discussion of the alleged mass sexual assaults in Cologne on New Year’s Eve had been censored on Reddit. “Until it became impossible to ignore, you weren’t really allowed to talk about the ethnicity and origins of the assailants,” he explained. “Twitter does many of the same things. Facebook is possibly the worst offender. It announced, proudly in fact, that it had teamed up with the German government to remove what they referred to as ‘hate speech’  …     about immigration,” Yiannopoulos continued. “What of course they actually mean is criticism and ridicule of the government’s immigration policies and the government’s refugee policies. ” “Your options to find information and to discuss what’s going on, to express your concerns, your anxieties, your options online are actually pretty limited. There aren’t many places you can go to tell the truth,” Yiannopolous stated. “Disaffected liberals, liberals who are so frustrated with their own side, with their own media  …     are coming over in their droves to sites like Breitbart because we actually tell the truth about things. ” Marlow noted that many social media sites are “putting their thumb on the scale away from the direction of free speech” and that Breitbart is becoming a “free speech central home for people who are disaffected” by outlets that are shutting down discussion from users for challenging the established news narrative. “Progressives have invented this new way of shutting down discussion they don’t like by calling it ‘harassment,’ by calling it ‘threats,’ by calling it ‘abuse,’” Yiannopoulos concurred. “What they do is they mischaracterize criticism and ridicule of the establishment consensus. ” “You’re going to be hearing a lot, if you haven’t already, over the next year or two about   abuse and harassment on the Internet. And what these journalists really mean is, ‘Someone caught me telling a lie,’” he continued. “You’ll see on news sites, whether it’s the Daily Beast or CNN, all kinds of huge, supposedly mainstream,     news organizations, they’re all closing their comments sections. Why? Because readers are smarter, more honest, and more ruthless about the truth than journalists are these days. ” In closing, Yiannopoulos pointed out how absurd this tactic has become by highlighting comments from Ralf Jaeger, interior minister for North   who said, “What happens on the   platforms and in chatrooms is at least as awful as the acts of those assaulting the women,” in reference to reports of mass sexual assaults on New Year’s Eve across Germany by suspected migrants. “Just to be completely crystal clear to listeners, he is saying that words on the internet, people expressing their frustration with their communities changing, with mass Muslim immigration, mass Syrian refugee immigration, words on the internet are as bad as rape,” he stated. “That’s what an elected politician in Germany said. ” Noah Dulis is the Deputy Managing Editor of Breitbart News and   of Breitbart Tech.

{"article": "     Former House speaker Newt Gingrich, a stalwart supporter of President Trump, used a   appearance on “Fox and Friends” to spread the conspiracy theory that former Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was killed last year to cover up the true story of how WikiLeaks obtained tens of thousands of hacked Democratic Party emails. “We have this very strange story now of this young man who worked for the Democratic National Committee, who apparently was assassinated at 4 in the morning, having given WikiLeaks something like 53, 000 emails and 17, 000 attachments,” Gingrich said. “Nobody’s investigating that, and what does that tell you about what’s going on? Because it turns out, it wasn’t the Russians. It was this young guy who, I suspect, was disgusted by the corruption of the Democratic National Committee. He’s been killed, and apparently nothing serious has been done to investigative his murder. So I’d like to see how [Robert S.] Mueller [III] is going to define what his assignment is. ”    Mueller has been appointed as a special counsel to oversee a federal investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and any Russian collusion with Trump’s campaign.   [Family of slain DNC staffer fights back against conspiracy theories with    letter]   With no pushback from the Fox hosts, Gingrich shared innuendos that got new life last week after Rod Wheeler, an occasional contributor to Fox News whom a conservative donor had paid to probe Rich’s death, told local Fox affiliate WTTG 5 that he had new evidence. On Monday, Wheeler claimed to have sources at either the FBI or the D. C. police department who apparently knew that evidence existed of Rich  —   who was fatally shot in July  —   contacting WikiLeaks but that an unnamed person had told investigators to “stand down. ”       Seth Rich came to D. C. to pursue a career in politics and last worked at the Democratic National Committee. Rich was shot dead on July 10, 2016. Here is what’s known about the murder. (Claritza   Washington Post)   By Thursday, after   questioning from CNN and NBC News, Wheeler had largely recanted his story, and Rich’s family had rejected Wheeler’s most explosive claim  —   that Rich’s laptop was in police custody. But Friday, and over the weekend, Fox News host Sean Hannity continued to suggest that Rich was killed in a  .   [A conspiratorial tale of murder, with Fox News at the center]   Like Hannity, Gingrich confidently made claims about Rich that have not been proven and that the family has denied. Police have investigated Rich’s killing, which remains one of many unsolved murder cases in the city. There is no evidence that he was “disgusted by the corruption of the Democratic National Committee,” though last week, amateur sleuths falsely claimed that Rich had posted online as “pandas4bernie. ” (He may have tweeted as “panda4progress. ”) There’s also no evidence that Rich contacted WikiLeaks. Until this week, conspiracy theorists had suggested that the hacker Guccifer 2. 0 used Rich to get into DNC servers, based on possibly altered direct messages between Guccifer 2. 0 and a model named Robbin Young. The new theories, which were covered on Fox News even as the source recanted, rely not on criminal evidence but on the fact that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange offered a reward for information about Rich’s killing and gave a meandering   when asked whether Rich was his source. But as the investigation into Russia’s role has picked up steam, Hannity and others have latched on to any suggestion that a source might emerge and link Rich to the DNC hack, though the FBI had spotted   hacks as long ago as September 2015. Hannity has tweeted his support of Kim Dotcom, a flamboyant New   Internet businessman now fighting extradition to the United States on copyright infringement and wire fraud charges, after Dotcom suggested  —   out of the blue  —   that he could reveal more details about Rich and WikiLeaks in the coming week.

Sheep that u all are! !! https:  .   —   Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) May 20, 2017      On Sunday, a new hoax spread on social media, suggesting that Rich’s parents actually endorsed the   conspiracy theories about their son’s death. Several fringe Twitter accounts, as well as The Gateway Pundit  —   a website that hired a White House correspondent this year  —   suggested that the parents were working around their media spokesman, Brad Bauman, to encourage further online sleuthing.     In fact, the video was recorded last month for donors to a GoFundMe site supported by Rich’s family.  Bauman, who had asked the Rich family to record that video, has also been a focus of conspiracy theories based on his long resume as a Democratic strategist. “At this point, only people with transparent political agendas or sociopaths are still perpetuating Seth Rich conspiracies and in Newt Gingrich we find both,” said Bauman. He can never know the deep pain he has caused the Rich family, and I hope he is held accountable either in this world or the next. ” Read more: The Seth Rich conspiracy shows how fake news still works", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> Former House speaker Newt Gingrich, a stalwart supporter of President Trump, used a appearance on “Fox and Friends” to spread the conspiracy theory that former Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was killed last year to cover up the true story of how WikiLeaks obtained tens of thousands of hacked Democratic Party emails. “We have this very strange story now of this young man who worked for the Democratic National Committee, who apparently was assassinated at 4 in the morning, having given WikiLeaks something like 53, 000 emails and 17, 000 attachments,” Gingrich said. “Nobody’s investigating that, <span class=\"technique5\" id=\"row0annotation1\" technique5=\"0.52\"> and </span><sup class=\"technique5\" id=\"row0annotation1\">5</sup> what does that tell you about what’s going on?

{"article": "   I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. If you read articles about how to help someone with depression, you encounter a few common themes. Don’t tell people to “snap out of it. ” Don’t say you know what they feel like. Don’t act as though they have a choice in the matter. Where Is the Heir to Rage Against the Machine? The view of depression as a clinical, chemical phenomenon —  an illness —  is, theoretically, commonly accepted. Still, many people with depression say that it’s often talked about in unhelpful ways. Music, perhaps, can help. Deep, enduring sadness has been a muse for rock artists for most of the genre’s lifespan, but this year has provided a fascinating crop of young talents finding fresh ways to make art about the topic. The most vibrant examples are Mitski, a      and Car Seat Headrest, a Seattle band. “Catharsis” doesn’t seem like the right word for what they’re doing they’re dissecting feelings, trying to convey how they work and what effect they have on a person’s life. The joy of the music is partly in recognition —  both of truth and of a sharp writer’s talents. Mitski’s Puberty 2 opens with a dull jackhammering pulse, maybe meant to represent a kind of looming dread. The song is called “Happy,” and she sings about the title emotion as a   stand who disappears from her apartment while she’s in the bathroom, leaving her to clean up candy wrappers and other detritus from his visit. Incongruously loud saxophones blare to horrifying effect, but Mitski’s chorus, like many on the album, is surprisingly  . It’s a very smart take on the idea of emotional absence, and in her press materials Mitski explained what exactly she’s going for: “Happiness is up, sadness is down, but one’s almost more destructive than the other. When you realize you can’t have one without the other, it’s possible to spend periods of happiness just waiting for that other wave. ” The theme holds across highlights like “Fireworks,” where an acoustic guitar briskly strums out a chord progression that creates a feeling of melting while Mitski calmly fantasizes sadness fossilizing into “a slight grey in my eye. ” For the   reverie of “Thursday Girl,” she sings, “I’m not happy or sad, just up or down and always bad,” and on the short closer “A Burning Hill,” she describes how lack of control can coexist with perfect  : “I am the fire and I am the forest   I am a witness watching it. ” To cope, she’ll do nothing dramatic, just wear a white   so that she can, at least, “be neat. ” If Puberty 2 masterfully demonstrates how a certain kind of melancholy feels, Teens of Denial, the recent album from Car Seat Headrest, is a powerful companion piece for talking about its causes —  or its lack thereof. While Mitski’s songs manage to gut the listener while remaining small and sculptural, frontman Will Toledo works in the style of anthemic but   rock reminiscent of Modest Mouse or the Get Up Kids. It is surging,   music, but its lyrical concerns are precise, introspective, and often   in criticizing how society treats the congenitally sad. The opener “Fill in the Blank” uses the conceit of its title to suggest the interchangeability of emotional drains, while the chorus is from the point of view of   critics: “You have no right to be depressed   you haven’t tried hard enough to like it. ” The trope of the gloriously tortured artist gets sneered at on the jittery “Vincent”: Vincent van Gogh, Toledo informs us, has his picture on the Wikipedia page about clinical depression. On another standout, “Drunk   Whales,” Toledo sings about feelings as topography, and the metaphor is mirrored in the music’s veering from valleys of strumming to distorted, noisy peaks. The song’s title refers to two very different feelings —  leaving a party, and watching the   documentary Blackfish —  that lead to the same feeling of malaise. It’s a great insight, the notion that a small trigger can upend someone’s entire state. When I saw Mitski perform Wednesday night in Boston, she issued a warning from the stage: “I was reading Hamlet right until I came up here, which was a bad idea. It’s made me very morose. ” The news came with a laugh and an acknowledgment that it sounded like a cliché. As the audience then sang back the words she’d recorded on her most recent three albums, it made those words seem all the more extraordinarily specific. That was especially the case for “Last Words of a Shooting Star,” on which she tells of how sudden airplane turbulence makes her imagine what people will think of her bedroom after she’s dead —  all of which, conceivably, could be another metaphor for sadness that comes and goes without warning. But after just 45 minutes of intense performance, with a number of great Puberty 2 songs yet unplayed, the lights went up and Mitski left the stage. “She didn’t want to be up there tonight,” someone near me said. That, of course, was pure presumption —  “You actually don’t know me,” Mitski had earlier told an overeager crowd member. You can understand, though, why her songs might make people feel otherwise.", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors.

{"article": " (CNN) Days after a raid on an al Qaeda compound in Yemen led to the first US military combat death under Donald Trump, the leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula released an audio message taunting the new American President. In an   recording, AQAP leader Qassim   condemned the January 29 raid, saying, ”The new fool of the White House received a painful slap across his face.”  The message was released online Saturday and translated by the SITE Intelligence Group. In the recording, Rimi also claimed ”dozens of Americans were killed and wounded,” a number starkly at odds with the US account, which reported the death of one Navy SEAL, Chief Petty Officer William ”Ryan” Owens. Three additional SEALs also were wounded. Rimi acknowledged the deaths of 14 men and 11 women and children in the raid, a joint counterterrorism effort between the United States and United Arab Emirates. A senior US military official told CNN on Monday that Rimi was a target of the operation. The recording was released after last week’s raid. Trump is using Obama as a security blanket, Civilian deaths, Reportedly among the dead was the    the daughter of Anwar   the late   cleric who directed attacks against the United States. Awlaki was killed in 2011. Reprieve, a   nongovernmental organization, and a   human rights worker told CNN that at least 23 civilians were killed in the attack. ”When the Americans escaped, they dragged their killed and wounded, and they found no other alternative but to destroy their own planes so that it would not be proof of their scandal,” Rimi said. The senior US military official told CNN on Monday that intelligence collection wasn’t the only objective of the Yemen raid but that it had also targeted Rimi.  In the event Rimi wasn’t there, the US military believed it would find intelligence that would help lead to him, the official said.    the mission was not dependent on   being there, however, a senior US military official emphasized.  US Central Command, which oversees forces in the region, and the Pentagon are strongly denying   was an objective of the raid. On Tuesday, Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis said, ”There was never any intention, hope, anticipation or plan that he would be part of this operation.” ”It wasn’t a   target mission,” Col. John Thomas told CNN, referring to operations aimed at killing or capturing terrorist leaders. Thomas added no hard intelligence indicated a ”high possibility” Rimi was at the compound on the night of the raid, saying that Navy SEALs would have captured any leaders of the al Qaeda affiliate, including Rimi, as part of an   operation.  ”Anyone found on site would have been taken,” Thomas said. NBC first reported that Rimi was a target of the raid.  The chance to take out such a pivotal member of al Qaeda may explain the large allocation of resources used in the mission. Military botches release of video seized in Yemen raid, Raid missteps, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula fighters detected the SEAL team before it reached its objective, leading to an intense firefight. Following news of the raid, the military had said the goal of the mission was to gather intelligence on the al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen.  On Friday, the Pentagon released clips from an al Qaeda training video seized during the raid but later pulled them because the video was nearly a decade old.  Government officials previously told CNN plans for the raid had been in the works for months and that Trump   the mission shortly after his inauguration. How Donald Trump’s first military action went from the Obama White House to deadly raid, The Pentagon said the battle resulted in the deaths of 14 al Qaeda fighters, including two AQAP leaders. Many observers have considered al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula among the most dangerous, if not the most dangerous, branch of al Qaeda since its formation in 2009.

{"article": "Foreign governments such as Russia and China may have been involved in the collapse of a voter registration website in the   to the EU referendum, a committee of MPs has claimed. A report by the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee (PACAC) said MPs were deeply concerned about the allegations of foreign interference in last year’s Brexit vote.  The committee does not identify who may have been responsible, but has noted that both Russia and China use an approach to   based on an understanding of mass psychology and of how to exploit individuals. The findings follow repeated claims that Russia has been involved in trying to influence the US and French presidential elections.  Ministers were forced to extend the deadline to register to vote in the EU referendum after the collapse of the government’s website on 7 June, 100 minutes before the deadline.  The collapse resulted in concerns that tens of thousands of people could have been disenfranchised.  At the time, the government said it was the result of an unprecedented spike in demand, with more than 500, 000 people trying to register on the final day. The report, published on Wednesday, said there were clues that a distributed denial of service attack (DDOS) using botnets  —   a network of computers infected with malicious software  —   was used to overwhelm the site.  “The crash had indications of being a DDOS ‘attack’. We understand that this is very common and easy to do with botnets. .. The key indicants are timing and relative volume rate,” the committee’s report said. While the incident had no material effect on the outcome of the referendum, the committee said it was crucial that lessons were learned for future votes that must extend beyond purely technical issues.  The report noted: “The US and UK understanding of ‘cyber’ is predominantly technical and computer  .  “For example, Russia and China use a cognitive approach based on understanding of mass psychology and of how to exploit individuals.  “The implications of this different understanding of   as purely technical or as reaching beyond the digital to influence public opinion, for the interference in elections and referendums are clear.  “PACAC is deeply concerned about these allegations about foreign interference,” the report concluded.  Britain is being hit by dozens of   a month, including attempts by Russian   hackers to steal defence and foreign policy secrets, GCHQ’s new security chief, Ciaran Martin, said in February. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said the National Cyber Security Centre, which Martin heads, had blocked 34, 550 “potential attacks” on government departments and members of the public in the six months to February  —   about 200 cases a day. The committee, which is chaired by the senior backbencher Bernard Jenkin, was also highly critical of the way David Cameron held the referendum to “call the bluff” of his critics and then resigned when he lost.  It said that in future referendums, the prime minister of the day should be prepared to carry on in office and to implement the result, whatever the outcome.  “There was no proper planning for a leave vote so the EU referendum opened up much new controversy and left the prime minister’s credibility destroyed,” it said.  “It should be reasonable to presume that the sitting prime minister and   administration will continue in office and take responsibility for the referendum result in either eventuality. ”  According to the report, there were many occasions in the run up to the vote when it appeared officials were being drawn into “referendum controversy” damaging the civil service’s reputation for impartiality. A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said there was no evidence to support the committee’s claim of possible interference from foreign governments.  “We have been very clear about the cause of the website outage in June 2016. It was due to a spike in users just before the registration deadline. There is no evidence to suggest malign intervention,” she said.  “We conducted a full review into the outage and have applied the lessons learned. We will ensure these are applied for all future polls and online services. ” ", "sentence": {"content": "<div> Foreign governments such as Russia and China may have been involved in the collapse of a voter registration website in the to the EU referendum, a committee of MPs has claimed.

{"article": "When President Donald Trump suggested last month that the reported rise in antisemitism might have been due to hoaxes, the media were outraged. [When Trump rejected  —   angrily  —   the premise of a question posed by a (sympathetic) Jewish reporter who asked Trump what he was going to do about antisemitism, that was treated as evidence of his guilt. And when he condemned antisemitism, it was not enough for Democrats, who are still alleging that he is to blame.  Last week’s arrest of a Jewish teenager in Israel, with dual citizenship in the U. S. proved that much of the antisemitic outbreak was, in fact, fake news. Though there has been a surge in   rhetoric and imagery online, and there has been some vandalism at synagogues and cemeteries, the bomb threats that caused the media sensation were not carried out by white supremacist Trump supporters, but an     journalist and the Israeli teen. Indeed, it is now impossible to know whether the few real incidents of antisemitism were part of a surge, or part of the low level of “background” antisemitism that persists, sadly, even in the U. S. the most tolerant country in the world. Evelyn Gordon of Commentary magazine  —   a publication founded by the American Jewish Committee, with a strong interest in Jewish affairs  —   adds an additional dimension to the story, noting that the teenage culprit was primarily interested in media coverage of the threats. Where the media ignored the bomb threats, he gave up and moved on to other areas where the media reported them, he launched threats against similar targets to amplify the public outrage. Gordon notes that the   reactions of   Jewish institutions and the mainstream media made the outbreak worse: For most of the last two years —  during which he threatened targets like shopping malls and airlines, as well as Jewish institutions in countries like Australia, New Zealand, and America —  his threats produced little media coverage, so he didn’t repeat them. But after Trump’s election, he suddenly hit pay dirt. Threats against U. S. Jewish institutions fit right into the American Jewish community’s loudly proclaimed narrative that the election had empowered     epitomized by   League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt’s ludicrous assertion that U. S.   was now at a level unseen since 1930s Germany. Moreover, such threats fit right into the broader   narrative that Trump’s election had empowered white supremacists, racists and other   hate groups. Consequently, whereas   acts received little media coverage during President Barack Obama’s tenure, they suddenly began receiving massive media attention following Trump’s election —  not just in America, but worldwide. Gordon concludes: “The   hysteria actually encouraged the very attacks it was meant to combat. ” And she makes one additional, crucial point  —   namely, that the threats began under President Barack Obama, but it was President Trump who took them seriously enough to investigate them, and to stop them: The Israeli police sources told Haaretz that even though the bomb threats had gone on for two years and several different countries were involved in the investigation, until recently, capturing the perpetrator wasn’t considered high priority. What changed that, they said, was Donald Trump. A few weeks ago, he ordered the FBI to make nailing the suspect high priority.   …     In short, for all the criticism he justly earned for his belated and reluctant condemnations of   Trump took action to stop it in a way his predecessor never did —  a point to remember for anyone who believes that actions speak louder than words. It is unclear whether the teenager had a political motive. Regardless, Trump has been vindicated. He is owed several apologies  —   and, more than that, he deserves to be commended. Joel B.

{"article": " Crude prices were slightly lower after a volatile session on Thursday, as the restart of two key Libyan oilfields and concerns about lackluster gasoline demand fed concern over whether major oil producers can alleviate the glut of global inventories. Libya’s Sharara and El Feel oilfields, which can produce nearly 400, 000 barrels per day (bpd) returned to production after protests blocking pipelines ended. U. S. gasoline futures led the energy complex lower in choppy trading, at one point hitting its lowest level seasonally in eight years after data on Wednesday showed inventories rose by the most in nearly three months. Brent crude LCOc1 settled down 14 cents a barrel at $51. 68. U. S. light crude CLc1 was down 37 cents to $49. 25 a barrel. “Gasoline is kind of keeping crude from going up very much,” said James Williams, president of energy consultant WTRG Economics in London, Arkansas. U. S. gasoline RBc1 tumbled almost 2 percent to $1. 559 a gallon.  ”Gasoline is leading the way lower with ample stocks, lower demand compared to last year, and an increase in gas( oline) stocks on the east coast,” said Anthony Headrick of CHS Hedging. “For the last four weeks gas demand is down 1. 8 percent from last year. ”  Global crude oil inventories have remained high, in part because of increased production from the United States. At 9. 27 million bpd it is at its highest since August 2015, according to government data.  Amid concerns about the persistent global oil glut the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia are in talks to extend a   deal to cut 1. 8 million bpd into the second half of the year. OPEC   Mohammad Barkindo said although the oil oversupply was declining, stocks needed to fall further, in comments that pointed to an extension in cuts. Barkindo did not comment directly on whether the cut would be extended, but he said efforts were under way led by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid   who is OPEC president in 2017, to get a consensus before ministers meet in Vienna on May 25. The International Energy Agency said in its latest monthly market report that oil stocks in industrialized countries stood at around 3. 06 billion barrels at the end of February, some 336 million barrels above the   average.

{"article": "The Trump administration has begun the detail work of stiffening the country’s immigration infrastructure, according to an internal memo from the Department of Homeland Security, moving to speed the hiring of border agents, to find space to detain thousands more immigrants and to hasten deportation cases. Even as the federal courts trip up President Trump’s ban on travelers from several predominantly Muslim countries and Congress signals it is in no rush to pay for a border wall, the administration is pushing the vast border enforcement network to begin choking off illegal immigration. Homeland Security’s plan to greatly expand its Border Patrol has been known for some time and includes adding about 5, 000 agents, in part by allowing some applicants to skip the polygraph test that is required for all prospective hires. That proposal has been praised by Border Patrol agents, who say the polygraph is excessively difficult, and questioned by some experts, who say the test is needed to screen out drug cartel members and other problematic hires. The memo, which was first reported by The Washington Post, outlined several other ways in which the administration is considering relaxing hiring standards and stepping up recruitment. Beyond removing the polygraph hurdle, the memo discusses eliminating a part of the entrance exam that tests the Spanish language skills of prospective hires, explaining that “few applicants fail the entrance exam solely because of these tests. ” New agents will still have to obtain “the appropriate level of proficiency in Spanish” to graduate from the academy, the memo says. All applicants must now pass two physical fitness tests, but the memo suggests that only one of the tests will count toward deciding whether to hire a Customs and Border Protection officer or a Border Patrol agent. Those who do not meet physical fitness standards at the academy, the document says, will “receive additional training. ” The memo is only a “draft that hasn’t made it to the front office yet,” said David Lapan, a spokesman for the department. “Anything in it is subject to change. ” James Tomsheck, a former assistant commissioner for internal affairs at Customs and Border Protection, said any attempt to speed hiring by lowering standards leaves the agency vulnerable to corrupt or compromised agents. “I can’t see how this makes the border any more secure,” he said, calling the polygraph change “preposterous. ” Even if more applicants qualify, the agency lacks the capacity or the money to process them quickly. By March, it took an average of about 300 days to hire a border agent, according to the memo, though that was an improvement over the   average in January 2016. The administration has already asked Congress to appropriate more than $60 million to help speed hiring, including money to encourage agents to move to less desirable regions along the border and expand recruiting efforts. Some of the money will help extend Customs and Border Protection’s outreach efforts at high schools and colleges and amplify its social media presence in order “to reach the millennial generation,” the memo says. Though the number of people apprehended at the border has fallen sharply in recent months and some detention beds are now empty, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has found 27 private and government facilities with 21, 000 more potential beds for detention, according to the document. But it notes that the agency does not have the money to pay for them. The administration also wants Mexico to agree to hold   immigrants while their cases go through American immigration courts. To speed those hearings, the administration is considering holding them by videoconference or sending more immigration judges to the border. The memo also says that more than 50 police departments are interested in partnering with the federal agency to help enforce immigration laws, a program known as 287( g) that the Obama administration dropped amid concerns that it encouraged racial profiling and other abuses. The agency is already in the process of signing on 26 other jurisdictions.", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> The Trump administration has begun the detail work of stiffening the country’s immigration infrastructure, according to an internal memo from the Department of Homeland Security, moving to speed the hiring of border agents, to find space to detain thousands more immigrants and to hasten deportation cases.

{"article": " Two days after Christmas 1977, police found Shelley H. dead in her apartment in Long Beach, California. The    had been sexually assaulted and strangled: She was lying on the end of her bed, her feet touching the ground, with an electrical wire tied around her neck. Vaginal swabs were taken during her autopsy, but at the time, there was no DNA testing. So the samples went into storage, and the case went cold for the next three decades. Then in 2011, a private DNA lab matched the samples to a man who had lived in Long Beach at the time, Martell Chubbs. The DNA, according to his attorney, is the only evidence linking him to the victim. And these DNA samples were particularly tough to read, tangled with the genetic traces of one or two people in addition to Shelley. What were the chances that the match was correct? Dr. Mark Perlin, the CEO of a Pittsburgh company called Cybergenetics, said his computer program could figure it out. In pop culture, DNA is often portrayed as a magical piece of evidence that links perpetrators to crimes and exonerates the innocent. But deciphering it is usually much messier in real life, especially in cases like Shelley’s that involve samples of more than one person’s DNA. Over the last decade or so, forensic scientists have come to realize that traditional methods for interpreting these “mixed samples” are often less reliable than previously thought. Now, Cybergenetics and a handful of other companies are selling a solution: software that claims to interpret mixed DNA with a high degree of accuracy. These companies point to several   studies that describe the underlying mathematical concepts of their programs, as well as results of mock testing in which they correctly interpreted known samples. But here’s the problem, according to some attorneys and geneticists: These companies claim that the details of how the computer programs carry out their calculations, spelled out in their source codes, are trade secrets. So there’s no way to independently verify that the programs are pinning the real criminal, critics say. “It’s a black box,” said Angelyn Gates, an attorney based in Pasadena who’s defending Chubbs, now 56, from a murder charge for the 1977 crime. That trial is expected to happen this year in Los Angeles County, and she’s trying to prevent the prosecution from introducing Cybergenetics’ software, called TrueAllele, into court. “You have a defendant’s right to   and determine, ‘How are you saying this is the result in my case? ’” Gates said. In her view, “Perlin says, ‘Who cares about your constitutional rights? I want my money. ’” Since 2009, TrueAllele has been used in more than 500 cases and helped convict robbers, child molesters, murderers, and rapists across the U. S. and the U. K. Another program, STRmix, has been used in thousands of cases in Australia and New Zealand since 2012. Just last month, in two double homicide cases near Pittsburgh, judges rejected both defense attorneys’ requests to examine TrueAllele’s source code. In December, a Michigan judge allowed STRmix to be used in a case, marking one of the first times it has been admitted into a U. S. court. Apart from how well the software works, privacy advocates say it exemplifies an even bigger problem: the growing and often unchecked influence of secret algorithms on society, from Facebook’s News Feed experiment on users’ emotions to the 11 million Volkswagen cars programmed to cheat emissions tests. “In so many things we use now, algorithms are being used to make determinations about us,” said Caitriona Fitzgerald of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which is filing public records requests to reveal TrueAllele’s source code. “Those algorithms are not available to people. ” Given the billions of DNA letters in each human genome, there are myriad ways that one person’s code is different from the next. But such differences are tricky to pin down in a sample with DNA from two or more people, as is often the case with a gun, shirt, or cell phone from a crime scene. Depending on how many people came into contact with the item, and for how long, their unique genetic traces may be present in large or small amounts. Sometimes a person’s genetic markers, or strings of DNA code, partially overlap with others’. And in small or decaying samples, bits of these markers can fade away, and others can sneak in through contamination. Scientists have known these potential limits for at least a decade. Last spring, the FBI notified crime labs that there were errors in the data they’ve used for years to calculate the chances of a match between DNA evidence and a suspect. That spurred Texas to flag thousands of past cases for potential issues involving mixed DNA samples. In a 2013 survey that has not yet been published, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) asked 108 labs to interpret a   sample with four people in it, and as a test, provided the DNA profile of a fake suspect who wasn’t in the sample. Seventy percent of the labs pinned the fake suspect. “At the moment, there are really no national standards as far as interpreting mixed DNA,” said Michael Coble, a research biologist at NIST who helped conduct the survey. The traditional approach for analyzing DNA samples, and attempting to account for extraneous code that’s in the sample due to contamination or degradation, involves throwing out bits of the DNA sequence that appear as either large or small outliers in the sample. This approach works well for samples that include just one person’s DNA. But in mixed samples, it runs the risk of discarding information that could be crucial to making a correct analysis. TrueAllele’s approach, in contrast, considers everything. “We have a method that’s objective, that uses all the data,” Perlin said. TrueAllele runs through up to hundreds of thousands of potential scenarios that might have produced the DNA code in a mixed sample, and calculates the probability of each. Once all the probabilities are calculated, they’re compared with the DNA of a suspect or suspects. Finally, TrueAlelle spits out a ratio: What are the chances that a DNA “match” to a suspect is actually just a random coincidence? One in 100? One in a million? Differing ratios may not always change jurors’ minds, like when one method claims a 1 in 5 million chance of being wrong and another claims 1 in 81 billion (as was the case with a rapist in Pennsylvania). But errors in how these ratios are calculated can really matter when two methods end up with wildly different results, like 1 in 420 versus 1 in 18 billion (as was the case in a fatal 2008 shooting). Ratios can also be contentious in investigations that hinge largely or entirely on DNA evidence, as in the case of Shelley H. ’s unsolved murder. In 2011, in an attempt to restart that investigation, Sorenson Forensics, a private DNA testing company in Utah, analyzed her autopsy sample and detected three people: two sources of sperm (one major, one minor) and the victim herself, according to court documents. Shelley had had a partner, but he wasn’t the major source, the lab found. Long Beach police say they ran the material through a DNA database of local, state, and federal crime labs, then arrested Chubbs upon finding a match. Chubbs was in the system because he was a registered sex offender in California for past crimes that included rape by force, oral copulation with a minor, and sodomy with force on a minor. The chances of the main sperm DNA profile matching an unrelated black person other than Chubbs were roughly 1 in 10, 000, according to Sorenson. But when Los Angeles County prosecutors sent the samples to Cybergenetics for further testing to prepare for trial, TrueAllele put the chances at 1 in 1. 62 quintillion  —   a number with 16 zeros. It’s these vastly smaller odds of misidentification that prosecutors may cite in their case against him. But TrueAllele isn’t only used by prosecuting attorneys, its maker Perlin says. He points to cases like Darryl Pinkins, an Indiana man who is serving a prison sentence for raping a woman in 1989. A TrueAllele analysis suggested that his DNA wasn’t in a sample taken from the scene. So now lawyers at the Wrongful Conviction Clinic at Indiana University are trying to use the results to exonerate him. Although Cybergenetics describes TrueAllele’s mathematical concepts in   papers, it keeps confidential the details of how those basic equations get translated into software. As proof that they work, Perlin points to studies like one with the crime laboratory in Kern County, California. An independent party created 40 mixed samples with DNA traces of two to five people, and lab scientists ran them through both TrueAllele and manual analysis methods. TrueAllele generated the correct results almost every time, while the humans struggled to figure out how many people were in the mix, former lab director Kevin Miller told BuzzFeed News. “I know that if I give it known samples, it works as expected,” Miller said, “so when I give it unknown samples, I have no reason to believe it wouldn’t work the same way. ” Perlin says his company lets anyone try out a free trial, that critics who want to see all 170, 000 lines of source code are missing the point, and that revealing it would expose him to copycats. Even though the technology is patented, he says his   company lacks the money to fight a patent dispute. Five crime labs in the U. S. use the TrueAllele software and hardware, which cost $60, 000, according to Perlin. Other agencies prefer STRmix, including the California Department of Justice, which found that it had “more reproducible and sensitive results with fewer  ” compared to TrueAllele. It has used STRmix in about two dozen cases, a spokesperson told BuzzFeed News. A trio of Australian and New Zealand forensic scientists began working on STRmix around 2009. They, too, have published its mathematical models in scientific journals. Developer John Buckleton told BuzzFeed News by email that “the source code is made available when requested under appropriate supervision conditions” but wouldn’t describe what those circumstances might be. The company declined to reveal the cost, but said its more than 50 customers include the FBI and the U. S. Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory. In December 2014, STRmix learned of a coding error that led the company to redo 22 calculations. The error, fixed within a week, did not significantly change any of the results, STRmix told BuzzFeed News. “No software can claim to be completely ” STRmix spokesperson Stephen Corbett said. Such incidents make more than a few forensic and legal experts wary. Dan Krane, a Wright State University biologist who has testified against TrueAllele, told BuzzFeed News the code would help answer questions about how the software weighs various factors, like how it discerns between signal and noise. “Those dozen or so different questions are individually things that people have been debating and arguing quite vigorously for the last 10 to 15 years. ” If a program says the chances of a match are 1 in a million, “how do you truly know that is the right number rather than 100 million or 10 million?” asked William Thompson, a criminology and law professor at the University of California at Irvine. “Are you going to run it a trillion times or a million times and see how often you get a false result?” Still, not everyone thinks raw code is helpful. “I’m more interested in validation: Does the thing work?” Greg Hampikian, the director of the Idaho Innocence Project, who works with Cybergenetics on wrongful conviction cases, told BuzzFeed News. “The results are clear from the studies I’ve seen. ” Fitzgerald of the Electronic Privacy Information Center suggests a compromise: that lawyers and experts could review a program’s code if they signed agreements to not reveal or copy it. Another alternative is free   software like LRmix Studio, created by data scientist Hinda Haned. Haned and her colleagues constantly receive feedback from users of the software, one of whom recently flagged a coding mistake. “I don’t think you have to be   to be good software,” Haned said, “but it’s difficult to interact with other scientists when there is this layer of secrecy. ” Chubbs has pleaded not guilty to Shelley’s murder. Gates, his attorney, had requested to have TrueAllele’s source code disclosed, but last year a court of appeal said she didn’t sufficiently demonstrate why she needed it. Now she is asking prosecutors to prove that TrueAllele is accepted in the scientific community in order to introduce it in court. TrueAllele’s report of the swab samples makes the DNA match to Chubbs look all but ironclad. The public believes DNA is largely infallible and to hear Cybergenetics and similar companies tell it, that’s still true. “I have a problem with the courts or any judge or anybody else,” Gates said, “putting Perlin’s financial gain over a person spending the rest of their life in prison. ”   ", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> Two days after Christmas 1977, police found Shelley H. dead in her apartment in Long Beach, California.

{"article": "One morning last April, a Delta Airlines passenger jet stormed down a runway at Atlanta’s   International Airport, hitting 138 mph. It was about to leave for Miami when an   controller realized he had given the plane clearance to cross the path of another jet that had just landed. He hurriedly told the pilot to abort takeoff, which jolted the passengers and risked damaging the aircraft. Fortunately, there was plenty of runway left for the plane to stop. What happened that day became one of thousands of incidents captured each year in commercial aviation’s multilayered incident and accident reporting system. The apologetic   controller filed a report to the U. S. Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, which decided it wasn’t a potentially disastrous   and graded it a C, for no danger. Reports like these, which can be matched with technical information on speed and altitude automatically transmitted from aircraft, are submitted under agreements between the FAA, airline operators, service companies, and unions. Many are made anonymously. Like   analysts scrutinizing a constant river of messages, airline and FAA safety experts work to head off disasters by searching for trends in these incident reports. By any index, the system has saved lives and money the most recent commercial aviation fatality occurred in 2009, when a regional jet crashed outside of Buffalo, N. Y. But recently,   safety incidents at U. S. airports have been on the rise: As the Wall Street Journal reported this week, hazardous “runway incursions” jumped 25 percent this fiscal year, increasing for a third year in a row. There are questions about whether the FAA and airlines are learning all they can. Predictive safety depends on faithful reporting of these incidents, which the FAA defines, in essence, as unexpected mishaps: incidents that could affect safe operations and that involve no serious injury or substantial aircraft damage. Yet there’s no clear line between what does and doesn’t meet this definition. Publicly, only abbreviated summaries are posted for most incidents, and others get longer accounts scrubbed of some details. Much of what happens in the skies and on the runways, therefore, stays in the skies and on the runways. The safety of flying depends in part on how much data the aviation industry decides to collect —  and on what mishaps it determines are truly dangerous. * * * Safety experts have known the value of   tracking and   analysis in preventing tragedy since at least 1931, when engineer Herbert William Heinrich theorized in Industrial Accident Prevention: A Scientific Approach that there were 300   for every 29 accidents and every one serious accident or fatality. In Heinrich’s model, the   incidents are the bottom of a pyramid, the accidents are the next level up, and the fatal accidents are at the top. Few now take the ratio literally, but the study of precursor events, aided by the processing power of computers and data mining, has helped to revolutionize safety management. In commercial aviation, separate reporting programs exist for airlines, air controllers, pilots, and technicians. The thousands of confessions, complaints, and other electronic data that roll in each quarter detail faux pas big and small, such as a clipped wing on a taxiway, or an unusually turbulent stretch that shakes up the passengers and crew. The FAA sees anonymity in this reporting as key. “We certainly would not get the transparency and type of data without the anonymity,” says Peggy Gilligan, the organization’s associate administrator of aviation safety. The closest analogy in    life to such anonymous or   data collection would be if every time you accidentally blew through a   or   another driver on the freeway, you filed a report with your insurer without having to worry about your rate going up or policy renewal being turned down. Recently, I spent a few days wading through what is publicly available via the Aviation Safety Reporting System, where anonymous reports are organized by types of calamities. I read about how one crew of a Boeing 757 forgot to lower the wing flaps for a daytime landing because their attention was diverted by the crew of a plane ahead who said there was a coyote at the edge of the runway. In another report, the weary pilots of a regional jet on a   journey landed at an airport without permission. “These kinds of schedules are ridiculous.   …     [I]n hindsight I’m grateful nothing else happened,” a crew member wrote. Another database, the FAA   Data System, which is operated by NASA on behalf of the FAA, has a different look and feel and lacks these unedited crew narratives. You can still spot the   about the Atlanta airport runway incursion involving the two Delta flights, but the database’s advantage is perspective it shows that there were a dozen runway incursions at Atlanta’s   International Airport in 2015, most neither close nor very dangerous. * * * Recently, a team of scholars that wanted to know if the FAA and airlines were learning from all of their recorded incidents turned to the FAA   Data System and yet another database, the National Transportation Safety Board’s aviation accident database. The National Transportation Safety Board investigates incidents and accidents to make safety recommendations to the FAA, and the FAA has become increasingly cooperative in sharing   safety information with the organization. In an article in the journal Risk Analysis, the researchers lauded the FAA and the industry’s accomplishments of recent years. But when they compared prior accident and   data from 64 airlines over a   stretch, from 1990 to 2007, they found that airlines learn mostly from incidents that conjure the memory of a prior accident. And that could lead pilots and controllers and mechanics to slip into a frame of mind where they routinize   and   adjustments, a natural human tendency toward “the normalization of deviance,” the researchers wrote. “It’s the ones that don’t scare you that we want the most attention on,” says Robin L. Dillon —  Merrill, a professor at Georgetown University and one of the paper’s three  . The researchers write in the study: the “prior   where risks were taken without negative consequence, deter any search for new routines” and “often reinforce dangerous behavior. ” The reaction to the journal article from Mark Millam, a vice president at the Flight Safety Foundation, a nonprofit that advocates for aviation safety, was typical of multiple experts I spoke to about this study. He conceded that the paper was “an interesting statistical analysis,” but he also had trouble accepting any of the conclusions, because airlines and the FAA have so much data that isn’t made public. (The FAA did not reply in detail to what is in the study, and pointed to their successes in safety as well as incident reporting.)   and her   relied on the FAA   Data System, so the study was based on FAA definitions of   alone. That includes, for example, bird strikes near airports. The FAA considers bird strikes “valuable safety information” that could affect aircraft design or   control near airports, but they usually don’t trigger engine failure or other damage that could cause a crash or force a dangerous emergency landing. * * *   certainly acknowledges that classifying events as   is a delicate matter. She believes that the best way to define and use   is as an infrequent alarm or warning signal. Set the criteria too low, she warns, and there is the danger that incident will be so common that they are ignored as pesky nuisances. There are other perspectives. One is that the relentless collection of data the past two decades has reached a point of diminishing return. After a while, says Shawn Pruchnicki, a former pilot and faculty member at the Ohio State University Center for Aviation Studies, “everyone assumes more data is better, but more isn’t better. ” Pruchnicki, like others who take what’s called a   approach, believes in nurturing a culture that copes with and manages suddenly hazardous situations. Obsession with data, he says, is part of an obsession with rules, and long prescriptive rules are confining. An aborted takeoff, such as the one in April in Atlanta, may not be the culmination of mistakes, but a symbol of a resilient and flexible system. “It’s all about understanding how the system responds to unfavorable events, how we respond, not the nitty gritty details. ” However carefully   are categorized,   and her   suggest commercial aviation make incident reporting even easier than it is and collect even more reports on even smaller and less obvious incidents. So how far should this go? If a pilot swerves or changes altitude suddenly to avoid a   collision, or needs to hit the brakes and abort a   and in neither instance breeches the required separation between aircraft, and no one is hurt and nothing damaged except the peace of mind of the passengers, does that automatically qualify as an incident? “If something is shaking the passengers up, I believe it should be further investigated,” says   —  even if it’s ultimately not classified as an incident. “Unless the passengers are shaken up by everything,” she adds.", "sentence": {"content": "<div> One morning last April, a Delta Airlines passenger jet stormed down a runway at Atlanta’s International Airport, hitting 138 mph.

The winner, to be announced at a later date, will be part of next year’s issue.  on  The finalists include students, aspiring reporters, actresses and models of all shapes, sizes and body types. They were broken up into two groups for morning and afternoon shifts last Friday at The Foundry’s offices in Industry City. The first group, which arrived on set at 9 a. m. took part in a photo shoot either before or after making their case in person to Sports Illustrated Swimsuit editor MJ Day. “I thought about running through lines, anticipating questions that would be asked in the interview   …     [but] that’s not what they want to hear,” Majors recalled of her preparation. “Obviously, you have to look good, they want you because of what you look like, but they also want you because of your personality and I think that was most important to me, so I just   that stuff that I prepared and came in like it was just a regular day, talking to anybody. ” Majors found her interview with Day to be relaxed  —   “we spoke about ping pong and Nashville the whole time,” she said  —   which matched her demeanor on the set. For others, such as Miss USA 2015   getting the chance to prove themselves to Sports Illustrated has been a   goal. “I was a little kid and I found these issues and I was like, ‘These are the most empowered, confident women,’” the    actress said. “I’m sure that’s what every parent wants their little girl to say. ”  on  Jordan has been modeling and acting for the past several years since her beauty pageant. Getting her foot in the door was only half the battle, she explained. “Sometimes there’s a stereotype, so people have to get past that and I sort of have to convince people to let me in the room and take me seriously as an actress,” she said. Former Patriots cheerleader   is the stunning beauty   of Patriots star tight end Rob Gronkowski. But she has struggled to find work in the modeling world since moving to Los Angeles to chase her dream. “I’ve been trying to sign with a big, reputable agency that would bring me to Sports Illustrated so that I could be a part of their casting,” the TV reporter said. “I was turned down by a bunch because of my height, my hip measurements. ” By allowing the public to participate, Kostek, 25, believes Day is ahead of the curve where model scouting is concerned.  on  “A lot of times when you go to castings you need to be on your thinner side or whatever, so this was so awesome to go into and know that they’re going to love you as is. Whatever your measurements are, they will accept you. It’s refreshing,” Kostek said. One finalist is guaranteed to be part of the 2018 edition. Should Majors be selected, she wants to show the world models vary in shapes and body types. “This is   moment for women who are featured in the magazine. I realize the prestige of it, but I just want every woman to feel like they’re equally represented in mainstream media,” Majors said. “I’m the biggest girl here. I proudly flaunt myself in a string bikini all the time, and I want girls to realize that’s OK, and if you get looks or whatever, screw those people because it’s just insecurities for themselves that they’re projecting on to you. “If I can just show women, and I feel like I get this question all the time: ‘How are you so confident?’ I feel like that is such an intangible thing to try to describe, so I just try to show them in my confidence. That it’s OK to just try to live in the skin you’re in. ”   A post shared by CAMILLE KOSTEK (@camillekostek) on ", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> When stepped onto the Brooklyn set of the southern belle wasn’t fulfilling a lifelong dream. “I didn’t even think that it was possible for me to be honest,” the of shared Friday with The Post. “I never considered modeling as a career, ever.

{"article": "Mets officials will take two aspirins and call on Matt Harvey for Friday. A day after the Mets   was scratched from his scheduled start and   after failing to show up at Citi Field on Saturday, manager Terry Collins provided an outline Monday for Harvey’s return to the team. Included is what Collins expects will be an apology to teammates upon his arrival Tuesday before getting the ball three days later in Milwaukee. According to club sources, Harvey claimed he was experiencing migraine headaches on Saturday after playing a round of golf and never showed up for the Mets’ game against the Marlins. After the Mets’   victory, team brass convened, and the following morning Harvey was informed by general manager Sandy Alderson he had been suspended without pay for three games, beginning Saturday. Harvey’s return to the active roster is slated for Tuesday, at which time he will meet with club officials and be asked to address his teammates. “One thing he has to do  —   and he’s done it in the past  —   he needs to address some guys,” Collins said. “He wants to do it in a group, which is the easiest, I always think. Or if he wants to do it individually, he can do that. I’m just going to leave it where he’s most comfortable because we’ve got to get this behind us, so however he wants to go about it to do that, I’ll sign on for that. ” A club source indicated the drama Saturday began during batting practice  —   shortly after 4:30 p. m.  —   when Harvey was noticed missing. Mets pitching coach Dan Warthen was twice dispatched to call Harvey and both times received no answer. But by the end of batting practice Warthen had received a text message from Harvey saying he had a migraine and wouldn’t be coming to the ballpark. Harvey was then instructed in a text message to report to the ballpark and receive treatment. Later, after team trainer Ray Ramirez was unsuccessful in reaching Harvey to check on his condition, the Mets dispatched two team security officials to the pitcher’s Greenwich Village apartment to ensure he didn’t need emergency medical assistance. A club source indicated Harvey answered the door and repeated that he had a migraine headache. According to a club source, Harvey had never previously skipped a game, but had been late arriving on a few occasions and fined $500 at least once. But Harvey missed a team workout  —      —   before the start of the NL Division Series in 2015 and later apologized to teammates. The source downplayed the idea Harvey’s suspension stemmed from a “compilation” of events, saying any player who skipped a game without being excused would have received the punishment.  Harvey was expected to file a grievance against the Mets, but as of Monday afternoon the team had received no indication such an action was imminent. Harvey has 45 days to file a grievance. But Mets officials are more concerned with getting Harvey on track than a possible legal battle. Harvey is   with a 5. 14 ERA this season in six starts since returning from July surgery for thoracic outlet syndrome. “He’s got to realize we’re here to help,” a team official said. “We’re not the enemy. ” Team brass had considered slotting in Harvey to start on Wednesday against the Giants, but decided waiting until Friday in Milwaukee would benefit the   on two counts: He would receive extra time to throw a side session and he would be shielded from the immediate wrath of the Citi Field fans. “I think we’ll get by, we’ll get through it,” Collins said. “He’s just a big guy, a big figure on our club. He’s a big figure in New York and that’s a big city to be a big figure in. All together with the help of his teammates and the help of his coaching staff we’ll move on and hopefully in two months we’re back to where we were with him pitching well. ”", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> Mets officials will take two aspirins and call on Matt Harvey for Friday.

{"article": "CHESTER, Vt.  —   The way A J Jackson tells it, he kept his head ducked down and pretended to fiddle with his cellphone as he walked into the boys’ bathroom and headed for a stall at Green Mountain Union High School here. But the way some of his classmates see it, A J was still Autumn Jackson, a girl in boys’ clothing, who had violated an intimate sanctum, while two boys were standing at a urinal, their private parts exposed. “It’s like me going into a girls’ bathroom wearing a wig,” Tanner Bischofberger, 15, a classmate of A J Jackson’s, who was not one of those in the bathroom, said this week. “It’s just weird. ” A complaint about Mr. Jackson’s using the boys’ bathroom set off a protest by students advocating the right of their transgender classmate to use the bathroom of his choice. On Thursday, the schools superintendent announced a new practice at the high school allowing transgender students to use the   bathroom of their choice, rather than being encouraged to use a   bathroom. The announcement came a day before the Obama  administration’s national directive was announced. But this week, there was a counterprotest by students like Mr. Bischofberger wearing   showing the male and female figures commonly used to label bathrooms, over the words “Straight Pride. ” Like much of the country, this rural school of 300 students in seventh through 12th grade, where everyone insists there were never any cliques, is divided over the bathroom issue, with the teenagers here carrying out a proxy culture war for their parents and the country. Still struggling to form opinions about what makes a civil society, they openly quote what they have heard their parents say about the merits or demerits of transgender bathrooms. And the dispute has driven apart young people who grew up together and were once friends. Some say the new rule opens the door to sexual predators disguised as someone they are not. Others say it just violates tradition. A society has rules for a reason, and this is one of those rules, that’s just the way it is, they say. But on a more basic level, students at Green Mountain are complaining that a small vocal minority of gay, lesbian and, as far as they know, one  —   or maybe two  —   transgender students among them are trampling on the rights of the majority to decide what the rules of conduct should be. That idea of a minority’s ruling unfairly is what motivated the father of one student to order the “Straight Pride”   online last week and send them to school with his daughter, who declined to be interviewed. The    students say gay people are being celebrated at the expense of straight people. “I just want to be clear: I accept everybody being proud,” said Daniel Baldwin, a    junior. Sitting at a table in the school hallway, a copy of “The Catcher in the Rye” open in front of him, he wore a “Straight Pride” shirt pulled over a shirt dedicated to Slayer, a   band. “Everybody has the right to be who they are. ” Mr. Baldwin said he thought people should use male or female bathrooms depending on what was written on their birth certificates. But he also said he would defend A J if someone tried to bully him for being transgender, or even for using the boys’ bathroom. “I would step up for A J,” he said. “We’re Americans. We’re supposed to be civil. ” Listening to him, Mr. Jackson said he was dismayed by how they had been torn apart. “Oh, my God, we used to talk for hours about music,” he said. More broadly, the issue here has pitted resident against resident, often along social and economic lines. This is a place where   transplants wearing Birkenstocks and artsy jewelry mingle with   people in   boots who know how to handle a shotgun and proudly inhabit the homes of their ancestors. Despite Vermont’s image as a place of bucolic egalitarianism, home of the avowedly socialist candidate for president, tensions over privilege and tradition simmer just under the surface, and the bathroom wars have brought them to the fore. “I go in and do my thing and leave, but I have a concern about child molesters and pedophiles,” Joe Kopacz, 48, who runs a   operation, said as he stopped into Lisai’s Chester Market. Society does not change on a dime, especially   society, said Deb Brown, a member of the Green Mountain Union High School board, speaking in MacLaomainn’s, a pub and popular gathering spot that she owns with her husband. For people like her daughter, who was on girls’ sports teams with A J when he was Autumn, this is intensely personal, not just philosophical. “As we move forward as a community, there has to be compassion on both sides,” Ms. Brown said. “He needs to understand that this has been 15 years that students have known him one way. It’s obviously his choice, but maybe he should have respect for his classmates right now. ” Mr. Jackson has gradually been making the transition from a vivacious girl with a big smile and long wavy locks to a husky boy with chopped hair dyed several shades of green, snakebite piercings in his lips and gauges embedded in his earlobes. His chest is visibly bound, and because he has not yet started taking male hormones  —   he plans to do that, and also to have “top surgery,” he says  —   his face is smooth and still has feminine contours. He once thought he was lesbian, and is still attracted to girls. His mother, Tracy, a case manager for children with developmental disabilities, and his father, Scott, a mechanical engineer, came to Vermont from Connecticut to try it out 20 years ago and stayed. They brought up A J and his older brother in a log cabin in the woods, where they raise chickens and ducks, including a duck named Bernie, for you know who. “A typical American family,” his mother said, smiling. He was in sixth grade when he realized he was meant to be a boy, he said, and came out to the school last year in ninth grade, sending emails to teachers. When he entered Green Mountain in seventh grade, “I was using the female bathroom because, I really don’t know, I was still kind of back and forth about my identity,” Mr. Jackson said. “This year is the year I started using the men’s bathroom, because I already felt like way more comfortable in who I was. ” There were practical issues. When he had his period, he wondered if he should revert to the girls’ bathroom, because there was no place to throw away his used tampons. But he had started feeling like an intruder in the girls’ bathroom, and the single bathrooms were so far out of the way it was hard to get to class on time. So he stuck with the boys’ bathroom. “I use a stall, and I wait till everybody’s gone to get up and leave,” Mr. Jackson said. “The guys, they look at me like I’m some kind of freak, or they’re concerned or scared. ” The only classmate who talks to him when he sees him in the bathroom is his childhood friend Connor Rose, a leader of the school’s   alliance. Mr. Jackson feels safe in the boys’ bathroom at school, he said, whereas in public places, like Dunkin’ Donuts, he is afraid to go to the men’s restroom for fear of being attacked by straight men. He said he understood the concerns of some of his classmates. “There probably are some transgender people that are bad people, just like there are probably a whole bunch of gay people or straight people that are bad,” he said. He had been using the boys’ bathrooms for less than a month  —   trying to go in during lunch or recess when he would not be noticed  —   when someone complained. No one knows for sure who complained, but a widespread rumor holds that it was a middle schooler. Hank Mauti, a school board member and retired sawmill worker from Andover, said he wondered why Mr. Jackson would feel compelled to use a boys’ bathroom when there were six     bathrooms in the school. “What about the little boy that reported it?” asked Mr. Mauti’s wife, Wanda, repeating the rumor, in an interview in their home, under a trophy of a moose that Mr. Mauti shot. “As far as I can tell, his discomfort hasn’t been addressed. ” Tom Ferenc, the principal, called Mr. Jackson’s mother the night of the complaint and told her that he was going to ask A J to use the   bathroom, she recalled. The next Monday, A J and about 30 supporters walked out of the school in protest. Three days later, the district announced the new policy. Mr. Ferenc was happy to get some “clarity” about the proper policy, as he put it, and proud of his school. “It reminded me of Rosa Parks, honestly,” he said. Besides the “Straight Pride”   counterprotest, the decision has set off a storm of discussion, sometimes nasty on both sides, on Facebook. Also, someone taped a sign to a trash can this week that said, “Reserved for Mariah and Tanner,” referring to Mariah Lique and Mr. Bischofberger, two student leaders of the counterprotest, who are dating. Ms. Lique said that she and Mr. Bischofberger were just saying what a lot of other students think but are afraid to say because if they did, “you’d get hated. ” “We’re considered more conservative,” she said. “Because we’re outspoken,” Mr. Bischofberger interjected, finishing her sentence. Two of their favorite teachers are openly gay, they said, and the students misunderstand where they are coming from. “They see us as   …    ” Mr. Bischofberger began, “hating their sexuality,” Ms. Lique finished. But that is not true, they said. Part of what troubles them is that Mr. Jackson is still anatomically female. “Autumn, A J, whatever you call them, hasn’t had any hormone or sex change yet,” Mr. Bischofberger said. “This opens up opportunities for other kids to do stuff they’re not supposed to. ” While everyone seems to sympathize with the gay students, they seem to have a license to make him feel ostracized and attacked, and it hurts, Mr. Bischofberger said: “They’re calling me a cisgendered, hypocritical homophobe. ”", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> CHESTER, Vt. — The way A J Jackson tells it, he kept his head ducked down and pretended to fiddle with his cellphone as he walked into the boys’ bathroom and headed for a stall at Green Mountain Union High School here.

{"article": "     Donald Trump and Paul Ryan had their   meeting on this morning, and while Ryan did not endorse Trump (yet) they issued a joint statement talking about their “many areas of common ground. ” Speaking afterward to reporters, Ryan said, “It was important that we discussed our differences that we have, but it was also important that we discuss the core principles that tie us together,” and that “Going forward we’re going to go a little deeper in the policy weeds to make sure we have a better understanding of one another. ” This is a fool’s errand, not just for Ryan but for us in the media as well. And it poses a profound challenge to democracy itself. Just in the last couple of days, something has changed. Perhaps it should have been evident to us before, but for whatever reason it was only partially clear. The pieces were there, but they didn’t fit together to show us how comprehensive Trump’s assault on the fundamentals of American politics truly is. And that has left the media  —   whose job it is to report what’s happening and describe it to the citizenry in a coherent way that enables them to make a reasonable decision  —   at loose ends. We simply don’t know how to cover a candidate like this. We need to figure it out, and quickly.    Donald Trump and Speaker Paul Ryan met on May 12. The result? A lot of cameras, and not much else. (Peter   Washington Post)   The foundation of democratic debate is policy, issues, the choices we make about what we as a nation should do. That’s what the government we create does on our behalf: it confronts problems, decides between alternatives, and pursues them. That’s also the foundation of how we in the press report on politics. Yes, we spend a lot of time talking about the personalities involved, but underneath that are competing ideas about what should be done. Should we raise taxes or lower them? Spend more or spend less? Make abortions easier or harder to get? Give more people health coverage or fewer? How do we combat ISIS? How should we address climate change? How can we improve the economy? How can we reduce crime? What sort of transportation system do we want? Which areas should government involve itself in, and which should it stay out of? We all presume that these questions (and a thousand more) are important, and that the people who run for office should take them seriously. We assume they’ll tell us where they stand, we’ll decide what we think of what they’ve said, and eventually we’ll be able to make an informed choice about who should be the leader of our country. Donald Trump has taken these presumptions and torn them to pieces, then spat on them and laughed. And so far we seem to have no idea what to do about it. Let me briefly give an illustration. On the question of the minimum wage, Trump has previously said he would not raise it. Then Sunday he said he did want to raise it. Then in a separate interview on the very same day he said there should be no federal minimum wage at all, that instead we should “Let the states decide. ” Then yesterday he said he does want to increase the federal minimum wage. So when you ask the question, “Where does Donald Trump stand on the minimum wage?” the answer is: everywhere and nowhere. He has nothing resembling a position, because what he said today has no relationship to what he said yesterday or what he’ll say tomorrow. And we’re seeing it again and again. Will he release his tax returns? Yes, but then no, but then yes and no. Does he want to cut taxes for the wealthy? His plan says yes, his mouth sort of says no, but who knows? What about his promise for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States” that so thrilled his supporters? Now he says it’s “only a suggestion. ” We assume that with an appropriately tough and smart interview, one or more of us in the media will eventually pin Trump down on any particular issue, and then we’ll have our answer and he can be judged accordingly. But that won’t happen. So because we don’t know what else to do, we’re trying to hold him to the standards we use for every other candidate: what does he propose, and how reasonable are those proposals? For instance, Politico attempted to take a serious look at Trump’s policy statements, and concluded that “Trump bounces across the political spectrum,” but “Many of his proposals are either unrealistic in terms of executive power or would run into a brick wall with Congress, making a Trump administration borderline impotent on the very issues that are driving his supporters to the polls. ” We should give them credit for trying, but the problem is that if you want to evaluate Trump’s positions, you can only do so based on what they’ve been up until the moment you’re making the judgment. But if he gets asked about the same issues tomorrow, the odds that he’ll take the same position are essentially random, like a coin flip. The problem isn’t that Trump’s positions don’t add up to a coherent ideology along the   spectrum, it’s that you can’t even call them “positions,” because you can never be sure which of them he’ll hold next week, much less if he eventually becomes president. And remember, that’s really the point of the campaign: to figure out what kind of president each of the contenders would be. There’s always some measure of uncertainty, since we don’t know exactly what crises the next president will confront or what kind of manager he or she would be. But with every other person who ran this year, an informed observer could tell you 90 percent of what they would do if they eventually became president. You might love or hate Hillary Clinton, but we can all come to at least a basic agreement about the policies she’ll pursue. At this point, can anybody say what Trump would do as president? About anything? It’s important to be clear that Trump isn’t just a “ . ” When that charge has been leveled in the past, whether against a Democrat or Republican, it was because they had one position (or set of positions) and then changed them. Even if the critique was animated by the concern that they might change again in the future, at any given moment you knew where they stood. You might judge them too opportunistic, or like their previous position more than their current one. But there was a progression and a logic to where they stood, and the assumption was that whatever their position was, they’d act on it. This is the way we’ve tried to explain Trump, assuming that there’s some kind of linear progression to what he says about issues: he was in one place appealing to primary voters, and there are things he might change to appeal to general election voters. But it’s clear now that that was a mistake, because that’s now how this works with him. That leaves us unable to talk about Trump and issues in the way we normally would. And this is a serious problem. The basic issue divides between the parties comprise one of the key foundations on which we build our explanations of politics. They structure the arguments and the contest for power, they give meaning to the whole game. They’re the reason all of this silliness matters, because at the end of it we’ll be choosing a new government, led by one individual who will make choices that affect all of us in profound ways. It’s clear now that Donald Trump may be unique in American history  —   not just in his inexperience, not just in his ignorance, not just in his bombast, and not just in his   appeal. He’s unique in that he doesn’t care in the least about the the things that politics and government are all about, and he won’t even bother to pretend he does. I’ll confess that I don’t know where this leaves us in the media, and how we should approach his candidacy from this point forward in order to help the public understand it. But that may be the most important question we need to answer right now.

{"article": " We’ll level with you: April 2017 is absolutely stacked with new streaming options, to the point where the committed viewer could get away with not leaving the house for the entire month. There’s a true bounty, featuring hotly anticipated original TV series, intriguing new documentaries, underseen recent classics, and some of the best films of last year.    We don’t recommend going quite so far as to forgo the outside world in favor of devouring the streaming riches on offer, but we’re attempting to make it a little easier to plan just how much of April you’ll need to devote to watching All of the Things. We’ve pulled the best options from a variety of services  —   Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, HBO, Showtime, and Starz  —   and arranged them by premiere date. There’s something promising debuting every few days, so bust out the calendar, cancel your social engagements, and start planning how you’re going to get through it all. Premiering April 1  The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (HBO  )  Andrew Dominik’s 2007 release was barely shown in theaters, due to the indifference of its distributor, Warner Bros. But its tale of the life and death of Jesse James  —   as seen through the eyes of his assassin  —   is one of the best movies released since 2000, with grandly poetic images and beautiful performances from Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck.  Godzilla, Mothra, and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters   Attack (Starz)  Godzilla, Mothra, and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters   Attack (GMK) is what   reboots Godzilla and Kong: Skull Island are building to: a gigantic   complete with laser beams, massive furry moths, and   dragons fighting one another. Granted, special effects have gotten a lot better since GMK came out in 2001, but there’s enough silly monster stuff here to keep you entertained and looking forward to 2019’s Godzilla: King of the Monsters.     The Kids Are All Right (Starz)   Midlife crises are collective in Lisa Cholodenko’s   comedy about a modern family thrown into upheaval by the arrival of the sperm donor to two lesbian parents (Annette Bening and Julianne Moore). Awkward as only a liberal dramedy can be, The Kids Are All Right features spotless performances by a veteran ensemble, including a breakout turn from Mia Wasikowska as the curious daughter determined to form a fledgling relationship with her biological dad. What’s great about The Kids Are All Right is that everyone is a mess, and that’s all right too. Plus, Mark Ruffalo gets to play the hot rebel  —   a rare treat.     Teen Witch (Starz)  1989’s Teen Witch is about the most important things in life: high school, magic, mean teachers, true love, and some really   dude named Brad. There’s also a makeover and Zelda Rubinstein, known for her work as the creepy medium Tangina in the Poltergeist franchise, as a slightly less creepy but still strange Madame Serena. Teen Witch is not to be confused with 2016’s The Witch, a horror story about a teenager who eventually becomes a witch  —   but who, unlike Teen Witch’s protagonist, does not have the ability to magically imbue others with rapping abilities.  Premiering April 4  Chewing Gum season 2 (Netflix)  One of Netflix’s recent British imports is the very funny    comedy Chewing Gum.    Michaela Coel is fantastic as the equally gawky and curious Tracey, who in the first season launched herself into the brand new world of sex with such reckless abandon that the results were both hilarious and horrifying. Season two promises more of the same.     Dimension 404 season 1 (Hulu)  Hulu’s answer to Black Mirror is this anthology series about the darkest corners of the internet, produced by the   online video kings at Rocket Jump. The series boasts an amazing cast  —   including everybody from Patton Oswalt to Lea Michele  —   and its vibe looks a little more overtly   than Black Mirror’s dystopian hues. Premiering April 5  Preacher season 1 (Hulu)  This 2016 adaptation of the acclaimed comic book of the same name lacks the kind of overarching storyline that would make it really compelling, but as a delivery mechanism for exciting moments, it’s a lot of fun. Like most   shows, it should play very well in a binge. Hang in there for some of the truly inventive fight scenes, and for the performances of Ruth Negga as the   Tulip and Dominic Cooper as the chaplain with strange powers who gives the series its title. Premiering April 6  The BFG (Netflix)  The most recent film by Steven Spielberg  —   released just last summer!  —   rather crashed and burned at the box office, despite its   premise and children’s literature pedigree. The gentle, lovely little film follows a young girl who meets the Big Friendly Giant of the title, and it’s sprinkled with just enough of the dark horrors of the Roald Dahl novel it’s based on to make it engaging.    Premiering April 7  The Get Down season 1, part 2 (Netflix)  The Get Down’s bizarre release strategy  —   the first season was released in two halves eight months apart  —   and a messy pilot seem to have gotten in the way of buzz for this energetic, enthralling tribute to the Bronx in the ’70s, the early days of   and the creative impulse. Here’s hoping the season’s final five episodes wrap up the storylines in satisfying fashion, because the series may be too expensive for Netflix to renew.  American Playboy (Amazon)  Does the world really need a   “docuseries” about the life of Playboy founder Hugh Hefner? Probably not, but Amazon is giving this one a big push anyway, and its promise of rarely seen footage from Hefner’s archive, alongside scripted scenes starring actors as the young Hef and pals, could make for something intriguing. Premiering April 8  Kubo and the Two Strings (Netflix)   With its gorgeous   design, a tale of adventure and fantasy in Japan, and the borrowed spirit of legendary filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, Kubo and the Two Strings was one of our favorite movies of 2016. Ostensibly about a boy searching for his lost family, Kubo knows what all good stories know  —   that a story reveals as much about the teller as the tale. Laika’s   animation turns every story into a feat, made even more epic by the herculean studio efforts that went into the film’s creation. Kubo features the largest   puppet ever created, and took five years of painstaking labor to finish. The result is pure cinema magic. Premiering April 13  Short Term 12 (Hulu)   Before she was tapped to play Captain Marvel, Brie Larson played a superhero of a more humble sort in Destin Daniel Cretton’s Short Term 12. The film follows the action at a residential group facility for troubled teens, where Larson’s Grace is a senior member of the support staff. Her difficult job takes a toll on her, though  —   particularly affecting her relationship with her boyfriend, who also works at the facility  —   which comes to a head with the introduction of a new resident who stirs up some buried trauma.   The Handmaiden (Amazon)  It’s just about impossible to describe Park  ’s stunning film without ruining the twists, but we’ll give it a shot. Though it was adapted from Sarah Waters’s book The Fingersmith, which takes place in Victorian England, The Handmaiden is set in 1930s   Korea, as an ambitious Korean handmaiden (Kim  ) plots against her charismatic Japanese mistress (Kim  ). But if that sounds straightforward, trust us: it’s not. The Handmaiden is a twisty, sexy thriller that never goes in the direction it’s telling you it is, which makes for one hell of a fun ride.  Premiering April 14  The Love Witch (Amazon)  The Love Witch is lit and shot to look like a 1960s Technicolor film, with costumes and sets designed by   Anna Biller to evoke a vaguely psychedelic fairy     horror   feminist psychosexual dramedy about a woman who’s hunting for a man (literally). If that bizarre combination appeals to you, you’re in luck  —   while The Love Witch leans heavily on its inspirations, it isn’t like anything you’ve seen before. It’s deliciously campy, sometimes shocking, and totally unconventional.     The Babadook (Hulu)   One of the best of a recent wave of outstanding horror films, The Babadook effectively made single motherhood into the ultimate nightmare while propelling its cast and crew into the   limelight. The Babadook delivers a star turn for Essie Davis as Amelia, the mother whose attempts to deal with her hyperactive, perpetually terrified son (Noah Wiseman) leave her exhausted, isolated, and open to the curse of the dreaded Babadook, a ghoulish children’s book monster. (Think Slender Man, but  .) This is already prime horror material, but   Jennifer Kent levels up by turning Amelia’s psychological breakdown into something so raw and scary that it becomes a form of primal feminist rage. If you think you’ve seen this one before, watch it again; it rewards repeat viewings like few films of its ilk.  Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return (Netflix)  Twelve seasons, one epic crowdfunding campaign, one successful offshoot cult website, and an infinite number of     later, Joel and the Bots are back! Longed for by fans of terrible   the world over, MST3K returns for an entire new season with an ensemble of geeky   including Jonah Ray as the host, and Felicia Day and Patton Oswalt as descendants of the original mad scientists who started this whole shebang. Keep an eye on the cult bad flick Reptilicus, which appears to be one of the movies riffed on, and enjoy the kitschy retro look of the comeback. Oh, and look out for MOVIE SIGN! Premiering April 16  Guerrilla (Showtime)  April is a crowded month for new TV, and Showtime’s big entry is this new   miniseries from 12 Years a Slave screenwriter and American Crime creator John Ridley. It follows 1970s political activists as they work to break cycles of police violence in the United Kingdom, and it stars Freida Pinto and Idris Elba, among others. The intersection of social justice and history is a place within which Ridley usually works well, so this is one to anticipate. Premiering April 21  Bill Nye Saves the World, season 1 (Netflix)  A science talk show isn’t the most natural idea in the world, but if there’s anybody who can make it work, it’s the inexhaustible Bill Nye. The first season of his new Netflix series unleashes a torrent of celebrity guests upon a variety of important science topics (climate change! GMOs! sex!) complete with   demonstrations.  Premiering April 22  The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks (HBO)   In 2010, a nonfiction book about the true story behind the world’s most commonly replicated “immortal” strain of lab cells became an unlikely    —   and HBO’s teaser trailer for its new adaptation of the book gives you a taste of how surprising and dramatic that story is. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a strange, harrowing, and deeply moving story of the way corporate greed often consumes and usurps individual identity, even after death. Throw in legendary Broadway director George C. Wolfe working with Oprah Winfrey and Hamilton’s Renée Elise Goldsberry, and this adaptation is a  . (You should probably have tissues ready.) Premiering April 25  Queen of Katwe (Netflix)  Mira Nair’s Queen of Katwe is based on the true story of Phiona Mutesi, an illiterate teenager from a slum outside the Ugandan capital of Kampala who discovers she has a knack for chess, thanks to a missionary (who also grew up in the slums) running a chess club for local kids. Starring Lupita Nyong’o, David Oyelowo, and newcomer Madina Nalwanga, it’s heartwarming and inspirational, but also the opposite of a white savior movie  —   and all the better for it. This is one for the whole family.    Premiering April 26  The Handmaid’s Tale (Hulu)  Margaret Atwood’s dystopian novel  —   about an America overtaken by a   movement that systemically deprives women of their rights  —   is 30 years old, but it has never felt more timely. Hulu’s highly anticipated new TV version is a smart, compelling adaptation that uses Atwood’s novel as a window into a terrifyingly plausible world. Mad Men’s Elisabeth Moss anchors the uniformly excellent cast (including Alexis Bledel, showing sides she never did on Gilmore Girls) but the real star here is the textured, detailed world building and the newfound urgency and immediacy of the story’s dystopian impulse. Premiering April 27  American Honey (Amazon)  British director Andrea Arnold takes a visually stunning, nearly   ramble through   America in this    road movie.   actor Sasha Lane plays Star, a   but naive teenager who falls in with a crowd of rowdy youths; the group  —   overseen by a   Shia LaBeouf  —   traverses the country in a van, selling magazine subscriptions to unsuspecting marks. A rambunctious movie with a lot on its mind, American Honey is a complicated evocation of the freedom that comes with having nothing, and what it means to define yourself outside of possessions. Premiering April 28  Casting JonBenet (Netflix)  In Casting JonBenet, a group of actors in Colorado audition to play characters in a movie about JonBenet Ramsey, the    beauty queen who was murdered in her family’s home the day after Christmas in 1996. Through the audition process, the actors start to reveal what they think about the case and how their own personal experiences shape what they believe. In the process, what we believe about the   case gets more complicated too. Casting JonBenet is a quiet and moving look at how we think about crime in America, and how not just media coverage but also our own lives mess with our sense of objectivity.  Dear White People season 1 (Netflix)  Director Justin Simien adapts his 2014 satirical film into a   TV season, a key part of Netflix’s attempts in 2017 to diversify its original series. The movie was pretty terrific (and funny) as it stood, but it’s not as if the intervening years haven’t given Simien more topics to tackle and issues to raise. And if early episodes are any indication, he’s done so with aplomb.  Catastrophe (Amazon)  The British comedy Catastrophe is a raunchy, delightfully unvarnished look at the challenges of marriage and parenthood, minus most of the clichéd trappings that usually accompany those topics. The painfully funny, eminently filthy series will tread some serious ground in season three, as central couple Sharon and Rob try to keep it together and manage their family of four in the aftermath of a drunken and devastating season two cliffhanger. While that may sound grim, it’s exactly the type of scenario that series creators and stars Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney excel at mining for comedy. The   season also features Carrie Fisher in the last role she filmed before her death on December 27, 2016; Fisher plays Rob’s overwhelmingly critical mother, Mia, and according to Delaney, she’s “a huge part” of the season three finale.  Premiering April 30  American Gods season 1, episode 1 (Starz)  In certain corners of the internet, this Starz adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s novel of the same name is the most anticipated TV series of the year, thanks to both a stunning cast (including old favorites such as Ian McShane and vibrant newcomers like Ricky Whittle) and showrunners like Bryan Fuller and Michael Green. Fuller, in particular, brought the seemingly unadaptable Hannibal Lecter books to TV, and the early episodes of American Gods suggest he might have done the same for this tale of old gods washing up on American shores.  Animal Kingdom season 1 (Amazon)  There’s no reason this TNT adaptation of the 2010 Australian crime drama film should be as good as it is. And indeed, the early episodes take some time to put all the pieces into place. But former Halt and Catch Fire showrunner Jonathan Lisco and his team finally turn the story of a crime boss mother and her fractious sons into a simmering family drama, filled with rage, regret, and secrets. If you liked Netflix’s Bloodline but wished it were 15 percent creepier, this is the show for you.

{"article": "A Los Angeles hospital has paid an anonymous hacker $17, 000 to free itself from a cyberattack that had crippled its computer system. The payment, made in bitcoin, an untraceable cryptocurrency, resulted in the hacker handing over the key to remove the “ransomware” planted in the computer system, Allen Stefanek, president and chief executive of Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, said in a letter released Wednesday. The hacker’s devious plan was first noticed on the evening of Feb. 5 when staffers had trouble logging onto their computers, Stefanek said. As a result, staffers could not communicate with each other, although the CEO said patient care wasn’t compromised. While it is unusual for businesses hit by hackers to pay ransoms, Stefanek reasoned it was best to do so in this case. “The malware locks systems by encrypting files and demanding ransom to obtain the decryption key,” the hospital boss wrote in the letter. “The quickest and most efficient way to restore our systems and administrative functions was to pay the ransom and obtain the decryption key. In the best interest of restoring normal operations, we did this. ” Phil Lieberman, a cybersecurity expert, said such attacks on hospitals are rare. “I have never heard of this kind of attack trying to shut down a hospital,” Lieberman told the LA Times. “This puts lives at risk and it is sickening to see such an act. ” HPMC immediately called law enforcement on Feb. 5, Stefanek said. It was not immediately known if the Los Angeles Police Department or the FBI agreed with the hospital in paying the ransom. The FBI has taken the lead in the probe. Ransomware is a specific type of malware downloaded and installed onto a computer system, often during a phishing attack. Once it attaches to a computer, it starts to encrypt crucial system files  —   locking out the rightful owner. The malware then tells the victim he or she needs to pay a ransom before a certain date or all the data will be erased. During the attack, nurses and doctors used pens and paper to take down patient information. The hack appeared to be aimed at getting ransom  —   not stealing patient information. “At this time, we have no evidence that any patient or employee information was the subject of unauthorized access or extraction by the attacker,” Stefanek told the local NBC station. However, patients at the hospital for   CT scans or others procedures that needed computers were transferred to other nearby hospitals, according to one report. There were reports earlier that HPMC has paid a ransom of $3. 4 million, or 9, 000 bitcoins, but Stefanek dubbed those reports false.", "sentence": {"content": "<div> A Los Angeles hospital has paid an anonymous hacker $17, 000 to free itself from a cyberattack that had crippled its computer system.

{"article": "    To some degree, I felt immense pride and joy as the president of the United States entered Cuba today, becoming the first to do so in 88 years. However, as I watched the live television feed from Havana, all joy was replaced with sadness. You would have thought, that for such a historic and significant event, the Cuban people would have been informed about the visit, and the various stops that President Obama was scheduled to make. All of that information was limited to the people, and most of them were not aware of timing or scheduling of today’s events. In other words, the Cuban people were not given the chance to express their gratitude to the American president by making themselves visible to welcome the American delegation to Cuba. They were never given the chance. You would have imagined that with the historical landing of the president’s motorcade, the streets of Havana would have been lined with hope. Instead, the live television feed of the motorcade was not shown on the island. The people instead watched a taped, delayed version. In another troubling turn of events, just hours before Obama arrived the civil rights group Ladies in White tried to stage a   protest on Palm Sunday, but they were arrested by Cuban security forces. These women represent the sons and daughters of Cuba that have been thrown in jail over their attempt to express the desire for basic human rights. And so, as I listened to the Cuban analyst talk about what the president’s visit may represent for human rights in Cuba, all that I could think about what the Cuban government itself wants, which is to stay exactly the way that it is. I do not believe that Obama has a true understanding of how unwilling the Cuban government is to change. If Obama believed that he was going to be able to preach about civil rights and open doors for the Cuban people during this visit, he is sorely mistaken. His message to Cuba’s government will fall on deaf ears. Let me remind you that the reason we broke diplomatic relations with Cuba in the first place was because of their totalitarian communist regime and what it implied for the developing island. At the time, our leaders believed that it was the only way to keep Fidel Castro in check. Now, I do agree with Obama that the strategy did not work, and as a result Cuba became more isolated and the people suffered tremendously. I believe that the Cuban government wants to form a   regime. They want open commerce but they don’t want any governmental change when it comes to the people. It is now up to Obama to prevent that from happening just 90 miles away from the U. S. coast. In doing so, he must approach this newfound relationship that we have with them as one of compromise, and not one made of victories and defeats. So while I am skeptical of what Obama’s visit to Cuba will mean for the people, I am in a way still hopeful that it marks the beginning of a very long process toward freedom for them. It will be a long time before they are able to exercise their own rights, but let us hope that this is the beginning of a path that leads to their democratic voice, their human rights, and their ability to become a self sustaining nation, which is what every Cuban wants.

{"article": "In an impassioned speech on Monday, Mayor Bill de Blasio sought to reassure New Yorkers fearful of Donald Trump’s incoming administration, by vowing to reject some of the  ’s most controversial policies and to address the multiple incidents of hate which have plagued the city since election night. Speaking to a packed auditorium in New York where people spilled into the hallway, New York’s mayor outlined how the city would resist some of the  ’s campaign promises. “We will use all the tools at our disposal to stand up for our people,” he vowed. “If all Muslims are required to register, we will take legal action to block it. If the federal government wants our police officers to tear immigrant families apart, we will refuse to do it. ” “If the justice department orders local police to resume    we will not comply. We won’t trade in neighborhood policing for racial profiling,” he continued to applause. “If there are threats to federal funding for Planned Parenthood of New York City, we will ensure women receive the healthcare they need. If Jews, or Muslims, or members of the LGBT community, or any community, are victimized and attacked, we will find their attackers, we will arrest them, we will prosecute them. ” De Blasio had an extended meeting with the   at Trump Tower last week. In his address, he recounted his visit, during which, he said, he had implored Trump to remember where he came from.  “I thought it was important to go to the   and let him hear what so many New Yorkers were feeling,” he said. “And my essential message to him was to remember where you come from. ” “There was a time when the values of New York City were under attack on the debate stage.   Trump at the time stood up for New York,” he continued, recalling Ted Cruz’s comments that Trump had New York values and was not a true conservative. “I hope he remembers every day what he saw, over all those years in the city, and doesn’t lose track of the very things that allowed him and countless others an opportunity. ” Following Trump’s electoral victory, there have been multiple reports of incidents of hate against a number of groups across the country. The Southern Poverty Law center has counted 701 incidents between 9 and 16 November. Despite its opposition to Trump, New York City has not been immune to the rising number of hate incidents since Trump’s victory. According to the SPLC, New York state had the third highest number of reported hateful incidents. Swastikas have been found   across the city since the election, including in university student dorms, the sidewalk in a predominantly Jewish neighborhood and the door of an elected official.  A rally was held in a park in a Brooklyn after a swastika with the words “Go Trump” was found   on to playground equipment. Hundreds attended the rally, where Beastie Boys member Adam “ ” Horovitz spoke as the park was named after his deceased bandmate, Adam Yauch, who was Jewish. Reports of Islamophobia have also been on the rise. On a bus in Queens, a couple allegedly told a    Muslim woman to remove her hijab. Also in Queens, an Arab Uber driver was reportedly told by another motorist he was a terrorist who would be deported now that Trump was president.  New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, said he had established a special unit of the state police to address rising hate crimes, as well as a number of other civil rights initiatives. New York City’s police commissioner, James O’Neill, said on Sunday that there had been a 31% uptick in hate crimes compared with the same time last year, increasing from 250 incidents to 328. Speaking to a talk radio show, he suggested that the rise was related to the campaign. “I have no scientific evidence as to why, but if you’ve been paying attention to what’s been going on in the country over the last year or so, that the rhetoric has increased, I think that might have something to do with it,” he said. Cuomo and De Blasio, both Democrats, were outspoken in their opposition to Trump during the presidential campaign. Trump called De Blasio “one of the most incompetent men” and the “single worst mayor in the history of New York City” while De Blasio said of Trump last month: “It’s impossible he could be a good president”. New York City faces the prospect of losing billions of dollars in federal funding due to Trump’s presidency as the   has vowed to cut funding for   sanctuary cities  —   cities that limit how much they cooperate with federal law enforcement officials in detaining undocumented immigrants. However, De Blasio is in a unique position as Trump owns properties in New York City, and the mayor still holds influence over decisions that could affect them. Despite the prospect of losing federal funding, the mayor struck a defiant tone on Monday, and vowed to protect undocumented immigrants. “This is New York. Nothing about who we are changed on election day. ”", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> In an impassioned speech on Monday, Mayor Bill de Blasio sought to reassure New Yorkers fearful of Donald Trump’s incoming administration, by vowing to reject some of the ’s most controversial policies and to address the multiple incidents of hate which have plagued the city since election night.

At Stanford, Teichman had   worked in Thrun’’s lab and was the perception lead on Stanford’’s     car. His summers were spent interning at famed   robotics research lab  ’ ”   Years before, Teichman had suffered from a nagging worry   that his house was going to get burglarized, according to a   . He had been receiving random phone calls, and   there had been a notice of an uptick of crime in the   neighborhood. So he rigged up his own security   camera and loaded it with the   technology that   he had been working on. He wanted to be able to tell the   difference between a tree branch in the wind or a burglar   entering the backyard. But nothing came of it since his house   wasn’t robbed. ” ’   At Stanford, Teichman met his   Dahlkamp,   who also specialized in seeing the world in different ways.   He had cofounded the technology behind Google Street View and   also went to Stanford to study under Thrun and work on its     car. ’ ’   The two were at a party together when Dahlkamp brought up the old   security system Teichman had built.

{"article": " The Trump administration announced plans to keep voter roll data it has requested from all 50 states and the District on White House computers under the direction of a member of Vice President Pence’s staff, it told a federal judge Thursday. The disclosure of the White House role came in a government filing required in a lawsuit by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a watchdog organization that has asked a federal judge in Washington to block the requests for voter data until the impact on Americans’ privacy can be fully assessed. A decision on the request for a temporary restraining order by U. S. District Judge Colleen   is expected as early as Friday afternoon. The commission’s request for voting information has caused a nationwide uproar. The states that won’t provide all of their voter data grew to a group of at least 44 by Wednesday, including some that said they would provide nothing. Others said that they will provide what information they can but that state laws control what can be made public.    Then U. S.   Donald Trump met with Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach in November 2016. (Mike  )  The vice president’s office said the commission’s letter asked only for publicly available data under state laws, stating that 20 states have agreed to share at least some data and 16 more are reviewing the request. President Trump has made claims widespread voter fraud cost him the popular vote in November, although critics say the claim is unsubstantiated and is a pretext for voter suppression.  [Why almost every state is partially or fully rebuffing Trump’s election commission]  In a court filing, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) vice chairman of the Trump panel and a leading conservative voice on concerns about voter fraud, said the data would be stored through the White House. The executive order in May creating the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity stated that the panel would be funded and staffed through the General Services Administration  —   a federal agency subject to privacy requirements. But that arrangement has shifted, according to Kobach’s filing. “At this time, there are no plans for the General Services Administration to collect or store any voter registration or other   data for the Commission,” Kobach said in response to questions from the court. “Commission staff will download the files   …     onto White House computers,” he wrote, adding that an employee of the vice president’s office will be responsible with White House information technology staff for collecting and storing any data.   a 1997 Clinton appointee, had pressed for details about committee membership and operations after the government asked her to toss out the EPIC lawsuit. The government defended its request for voter details saying the data was “publicly available” and that the commission planned to “ ” sensitive data before releasing documents. It also said the voter commission was a presidential advisory panel not subject to federal privacy review requirements. In its response, EPIC President Marc Rotenberg called the privacy implications of the demand for voter roll data from across the country “staggering,” and said the commission had no authority “to gather hundreds of millions of voter records from the states or to create a secret database stored in the White House. ” EPIC wrote to the court that the commissionsought data “at the heart of democratic institutions and protected under state law   …     without complying with any of the laws enacted to protect personal privacy. ” The privacy watchdog said the panel’s June 28 request to collect, store and publish personal voter information covered at least 157 million registered voters, or more than the 149 million individual tax returns received by the Internal Revenue Service. EPIC said the proposal would increase privacy risks to every registered voter, “including in particular military families whose home addresses would be revealed. ” In its letters to state officials, the commission invited them to submit state data by email, or by an   file exchange website, with an invalid security certification system, neither of which appear secured, EPIC said. It also highlighted the commission’s request for partial Social Security Numbers  —   often used as passwords for commercial services  —   and felony conviction data included in voter data, and said plans to make such information publicly available “is both without precedent and crazy. ” Trump formed the commission after repeatedly suggesting that voter fraud cost him the popular vote against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Studies and state officials of both parties have found no evidence of widespread voting fraud.

{"article": "Sanders’ supporters are alleging that foul play by casino managers helped Clinton out in Saturday’s contest, while Clinton’s camp has blasted   in at times vulgar terms   the Vermont senator’s assertion he took the state’s Latino vote. The tensions reflect the tight battle between the two heading into next Saturday’s South Carolina primary. Sanders, who had surged in recent months to challenge   Clinton, is trying to maintain momentum against her in a part of the United States where she wields an advantage among minority voters.     The angrier tone also marks a turn from what has been a mostly civil race on the Democratic side, in contrast with the noisy   that has characterized much of the Republican race. . While Sanders and the former first lady have publicly clashed on their approaches to healthcare and regulating Wall Street, they have frequently emphasized their common ground on social issues. Sanders has also refused so far to join in Republican attacks on Clinton’s record as secretary of state. ”Let’s talk about the real issues facing America,” he said during one televised debate. The tone soured after Nevada. Officials with National Nurses United, which endorsed Sanders, have said there were irregularities at casino caucus sites   such as casino managers wearing Clinton paraphernalia   which they said amounted to intimidation of casino employee voters. ”From what nurses observed in Nevada Sanders campaign should call for UN observers to protect democracy,” the union said in one Twitter post on Sunday. Neither Clinton nor Sanders’ campaigns immediately responded to requests for comment on the allegations. Meanwhile, both campaigns have argued about what the polling from the Nevada caucuses show. One set of entrance and exit poll results conducted by CBS News showed Sanders took 53 percent of Latino votes in the state. This is a critical group for Sanders as he seeks to broaden his support base after his early results   a very narrow loss and a decisive win   in Iowa and New Hampshire, which have overwhelmingly white voter populations. ”I don’t typically like to swear on Twitter, but by all accounts so far this is complete and utter bullshit,” Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill wrote on Twitter, referring to a Sanders’ campaign press release asserting he took the Latino bloc in Nevada. Clinton has been expected to find easier territory as  contests move into the south in the    battles to pick a party presidential nominee for the November general election. Her backers say minority voters are her ”firewall” against Sanders’ popularity among young voters who dislike establishment politics and are attracted by his vows to take on Wall Street excesses and high college fees. She won Nevada, which is nearly a quarter Latino, by just over 5 points. Sanders’ camp, meanwhile, has disputed Clinton camp assertions that she drew the lion’s share of the union votes in the Nevada contest, accusing her campaign of inventing figures.  ”They do have a tendency to make stuff up,” Sanders’ spokesman Michael Briggs said in an email. The American Federation of Teachers issued a press release on Monday listing 23 unions that back Clinton.

[Since the election, Rush Limbaugh has been hammering the point that the campaign has only continued  —   and extended the trend set in 2010, when Democrats lost the House.   Since then, Democrats have lost 1200 national and statewide seats. And earlier this week, Stewart Lawrence, writing in the Daily Caller, and picking up on a study by the centrist “Third Way” think tank, noted that the Democrats are now almost exclusively a coastal party, with a couple of lone interior outposts such as Chicago and Minneapolis.  According to the study, while Hillary Clinton beat Trump in California, New York and Massachusetts by 30% Trump won the rest of the states by  %.  Some 32 state legislatures are in Republican hands, but in only five states do Democrats control both houses of the legislature and the governor’s mansion. And, as many (including Lawrence) note, in 2018 the Democrats must defend 10 U. S. Senate seats in states that Trump won.  Meanwhile, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, once thought dead in the water, won   in 2016, as did John McCain in Arizona, despite the fact that many conservatives, sick of his antics, voted for the Democrat. If the left can’t win these seats  —   the most   of fruit  —   where can they win? The fact is, although we now know the polls were horribly wrong, Trump’s victory was quite small compared to what it might have been. Consider: Trump lost these seven states by a total of 510, 000 votes  —   shifting 51 electoral votes and narrowly denying him a massive landslide territory. The “flip factor”  —   what is needed to reverse the decision  —   was a mere 260, 000 votes. Trump gained 290, 000 votes more than Romney in Pennsylvania alone between 2012 and 2016. In short, the fake news media is missing a much larger story: that the Democrats are teetering on the edge of an abyss that could see them utterly wiped out in 2018 and 2020.

{"article": " An offshoot of the militant Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) claimed responsibility on Sunday for twin bombings that killed 38 people and wounded 155 outside an Istanbul soccer stadium, an attack for which the Turkish government vowed vengeance.  The Kurdistan Freedom Hawks (TAK) which has claimed several other deadly attacks in Turkey this year, said in a statement on its website that it was behind Saturday night’s blasts, which shook a nation still trying to recover from a failed military coup and a number of bombings this year..  Saturday’s attacks took place near the Vodafone Arena, home to Istanbul’s Besiktas soccer team, about two hours after a match at the stadium and appeared to target police officers. The first was a car bomb outside the stadium, followed within a minute by a suicide bomb attack in an adjacent park. TAK, which has claimed responsibility for an Ankara bombing that killed 37, is an offshoot of the PKK, which has carried out a violent,   insurgency, mainly in Turkey’s largely Kurdish southeast.  ”What we must focus on is this terror burden. Our people should have no doubt we will continue our battle against terror until the end,” Turkey President Tayyip Erdogan told reporters after meeting injured victims in an Istanbul hospital. ’WE WILL HAVE VENGEANCE’ Speaking at a funeral for five of the police officers at the Istanbul police headquarters, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said: ”Sooner or later we will have our vengeance. This blood will not be left on the ground, no matter what the price, what the cost.” Soylu also warned those who would offer support to the attackers on social media or elsewhere; comments aimed at   politicians the government accuses of having links to the PKK, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, Europe and Turkey. In recent months thousands of Kurdish politicians have been detained, including dozens of mayors and the leaders of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) parliament’s   opposition party, accused of having links to the PKK. The crackdown against Kurdish politicians has coincided with widespread purges of state institutions after July’s failed coup, which the government blames on followers of a U. S.  Muslim cleric.  Turkey says the measures are necessary to defend its security, while rights groups and some Western allies accuse it of skirting the rule of law and trampling on freedoms. In a statement, the   HDP condemned the attack and urged the government to end what it called the language and politics of ”polarization, hostility and conflict”. Soylu said that the first explosion was at an assembly point for riot police. The second came as police surrounded the suicide bomber in the nearby Macka park.   people died, including 30 police and seven civilians, he said. One person remained unidentified. Thirteen people have been detained in connection with the attacks, Soylu said. A total of 155 people were being treated in hospital, with 14 of them in intensive care and five in surgery, Health Minister Recep Akdag told a news conference.     Flags flew at   and Sunday was declared a day of national mourning.  Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said that Turkey’s allies should show solidarity with it in the fight against terrorism, a reference to disagreements with the United States over the fellow NATO member’s policy on Syria. Washington backs the Syrian Kurdish YPG in the fight against Islamic State. Turkey, meanwhile, says the militia is an extension of the PKK and a terrorist group. In addition to the Kurdish insurgency, Turkey is battling Islamic State as a member of the United   coalition against the jihadist group. Less than a week ago Islamic State urged its supporters to target Turkey’s ”security, military, economic and media establishment”. ’MY SON WAS MASSACRED’ Video purporting to show the father of one of the victims, a    medical student in Istanbul for a weekend visit, went viral on social media in Turkey. ”I don’t want my son to be a martyr, my son was massacred,” the footage showed the father saying. ”His goal was to be a doctor and help people like this, but now I am carrying him back in a funeral car.” Security remained tight in Istanbul, with police helicopters buzzing overhead in the Besiktas district near the stadium. NATO   Jens Stoltenberg condemned what he described as ”horrific acts of terror” while European leaders also sent messages of solidarity. German Chancellor Angela Merkel called Erdogan to convey her condolences, sources in his office said. The United States condemned the attack and said it stood with its NATO ally.

[As Breitbart Texas has been reporting, since last week, rival factions of the Gulf Cartel went to war in an effort to seize control of Reynosa. The fighting has led to convoys of gunmen riding in marked SUVs roaming the streets searching for their rivals. The border city of Reynosa is immediately south of McAllen, Texas.   As a response to the cartel violence, the Tamaulipas government has deployed police tactical teams and has called on the Mexican Army and the Mexican Navy to help suppress cartel activity. Military helicopters with snipers on board have been used contain cartel convoys. According to the Tamaulipas government, since the violence started there have been 20 individuals killed and six injured, however, local residents claim the death toll is higher. Mexican authorities have seized armored SUV’s, grenades, various automatic weapons and other weapons.  The fighting comes days after as Breitbart Texas reported, the Mexican government killed Juan Manuel “Comandante Toro” Loiza Salinas, the regional leader of the Gulf Cartel in Reynosa. The man known as El Toro had been linked not only to drug trafficking but also to human smuggling, kidnapping, extortion and other violent crimes that have terrorized this border city.  After El Toro’s death, various of his commanders have been fighting to keep control of Reynosa while rival commanders linked to the faction that controls the border city of Matamoros have been making a push for control. The border city of Matamoros is immediately south of Brownsville, Texas. Editor’s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, and Nuevo León to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.  The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.

{"article": " (CNN)[Breaking news update at 12:35 a. m.] Woodmore Elementary School bus driver Johnthony Walker has been arrested and charged with multiple counts of vehicular homicide, reckless endangerment and reckless driving, according to Chattanooga Police Chief Fred Fletcher.  [Previous story, published at 11:25 a. m.] A school bus slammed into a tree and split apart Monday, killing at least six children in Chattanooga, Tennessee, officials said. Frantic parents arrived at the scene, screaming and crying. A spokeswoman for the Hamilton County District Attorney’s Office confirmed the death toll. But Chattanooga Police Chief Fred Fletcher would only say ”multiple children” were killed, declining to specify how many died because the scene was still active. Fletcher said the bus, which was carrying 35 students in kindergarten through   from Woodmore Elementary School, turned over on its side and struck the tree. Authorities received a call about the crash just before 3:30 p. m. and emergency officials worked for ”many hours” to remove all the children from the bus, he said.  Fletcher said 23 victims were transported to Erlanger Hospital in Chattanooga.  Speed is a possible factor, ”Certainly, speed is being investigated very, very strongly as a factor in this crash,” Fletcher said, adding that the investigation was still at an early stage.  He added that driving conditions were clear and dry.  Fletcher said ”a warrant has been issued to remove the informational box on the school bus and review the video.” Police said the bus driver is cooperative and talking to investigators.  Fletcher said the families of the victims were still being notified Monday night.  ”Taking care of the children that are injured is our No. 1 priority. Taking care of the families who are looking for, caring for and grieving for children is our second priority,” Fletcher said. He added: ”Our thoughts, our prayers and all of our efforts are with the families of these children and others impacted by this tragedy.” The National Transportation Safety Board said it would send a team to Chattanooga early Tuesday, according to a tweet from the federal agency’s account.  ’That’s my baby’ At the scene, parents were heard crying and screaming ”that’s my baby” as they arrived,   WTVC reported. A woman who lives near the crash told CNN affiliate WDEF the impact was so powerful it knocked her power out. ”I just heard a big boom,” the woman said.  Fletcher, in a press conference, called the crash scene ”a complicated crime scene” that covered a large area.  ”What has happened today is every public safety official’s absolute worst nightmare, but that is nothing in comparison to the nightmare that families and friends and our community is going through with this tragic loss to children in our community,” Fletcher said.  Melydia Clewell, the spokeswoman from the district attorney’s office, said at least five children died on the scene, and one died at a hospital.  Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker called the crash ”heartbreaking” in a tweet.  A tweet from the Chattanooga Fire Department showed the bus on its side and up against a tree as emergency officials extricated the last patient through the back door. ’Hundreds and hundreds’ of donors giving blood, Blood Assurance, a blood bank in the Chattanooga area, extended its hours at three locations, as ”hundreds and hundreds” of donors flocked to give blood to treat crash victims, said Mindy Quinn of Blood Assurance.  ”We have had people who were refusing to leave until they give blood,” Quinn said. Quinn said they brought two bloodmobiles to one blood bank because of the huge response. She said they were     donors and trying to schedule donors for the days ahead and into next week.   ”The blood isn’t going to be needed for just tonight,” she said. Interim Hamilton County Department of Education Superintendent Kirk Kelly called the crash ”one of the worst days” the school community has experienced.   ”This has been a great tragedy for us. We have suffered a great loss today,” Kelly said in a news conference. He said district schools will be open Tuesday, and officials will offer support for students and staff, including guidance counselors, for as long as they are needed. ”We will do everything that we can to try to help the families involved in this tragedy,” Kelly said.

[Previous story, published at 11:25 a. m.] A school bus slammed into a tree and split apart Monday, killing at least six children in Chattanooga, Tennessee, officials said. Frantic parents arrived at the scene, screaming and crying. A spokeswoman for the Hamilton County District Attorney’s Office confirmed the death toll. But Chattanooga Police Chief Fred Fletcher would only say ”multiple children” were killed, declining to specify how many died because the scene was still active. Fletcher said the bus, which was carrying 35 students in kindergarten through from Woodmore Elementary School, turned over on its side and struck the tree. Authorities received a call about the crash just before 3:30 p. m. and emergency officials worked for ”many hours” </div>", "key": "8f08d7a4-49b9-11ec-96f3-6e0781bad58a", "sentence_propaganda":
