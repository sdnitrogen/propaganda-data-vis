During the brief part of the meeting that was open to reporters, Clinton referenced Dallas, where five police officers were shot and killed in July. She also talked about Baton Rouge, La. where police fatally shot Alton Sterling, a    black man, while he was on the ground. Clinton said there’s a lot of work to do to repair trust between communities and police. ”We need to work together to bridge our divides, not stoke even more divisiveness,” she said. Clinton struck a similar theme earlier this week in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. While campaigning before a largely white audience in Scranton on Monday, Clinton mentioned the protests in Milwaukee, which broke out after police shot and killed a black man there last weekend. ”Look at what’s happening in Milwaukee right now,” Clinton said. ”We’ve got urgent work to do to rebuild trust between police and communities and get back to the fundamental principle: Everyone should have respect for the law and be respected by the law.” Clinton’s Republican rival, Donald Trump, also talked about Milwaukee this week. During a campaign stop in the nearby suburb of West Bend, Trump accused Clinton of being   because of her calls for reform of the criminal justice system. ”She is against the police, believe me. You know it and I know it, and guess what: She knows it,” Trump told the crowd. Critics on the left, including groups like Black Lives Matter, have accused Clinton of being too slow to address concerns from   and their allies  —   a key part of the Democratic base  —   about aggressive policing. Clinton herself has acknowledged that tension. ”I know that just by saying all these things together, I may upset some people,” she said. Speaking to the African Methodist Episcopal Church General Conference on the day after the Dallas police shootings, Clinton called for national guidelines on the use of deadly force and better training for police. ”I’m talking about criminal justice reform the day after a horrific attack on police officers,” Clinton said. ”I’m talking about courageous honorable police officers just a few days after   killings in Louisiana and Minnesota.” While Hillary Clinton tries to navigate those conversations, Donald Trump is walking another line. This week, he’s been praising police while promising to bring ”law and order” to   neighborhoods.

They are afraid to do anything about it because they don’t want to be accused of profiling,” Trump said on Fox News on Monday. Trump pointed to how Israel used profiling and ”done an unbelievable job.” Trump did not say on what attributes he would encourage police to profile possible suspects, but It’s illegal for police to subject US persons to disparate treatment based on their race or other protected status.  ”They see somebody that’s suspicious, they will profile,” Trump said. ”Look what’s going on: Do we really have a choice? We’re trying to be so politically correct in our country, and this is only going to get worse.” RELATED: Trump labels Clinton ’weak and ineffective’ in wake of bombings, Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, disputed that Trump meant police should start ”racial” profiling. ”I mean if authorities are going to look the other way, then at least we have a presidential candidate who is telling the Americans who say, ’I’m are so tired of looking the other way’ we don’t have a vetting process, we don’t have borders,” she told CNN’s Erin Burnett on ”Outfront” Tuesday. ”We have people so worried about political correctness that look at what this did the other night, people were injured.” The man suspected in Saturday’s bombings in New York and New Jersey was captured Monday after a manhunt and shootout. Ahmad Khan Rahami is suspected of bombings Saturday in New York City and Seaside Park, New Jersey, and is believed to be connected to pipe bombs found Sunday night in Elizabeth, New Jersey, sources told CNN. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declined to comment on the issue of profiling Tuesday. But Trump’s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, defended Trump’s comments. ”I think it’s all about common sense,” Pence told MSNBC’s Kelly O’Donnell. ”Talking with law enforcement officers, they’ll tell you that today they feel like they operate in an environment of political correctness, where they can’t use common sense to be able to target resources and target their energies against individuals who would be the most likely potential threat to our families and to the safety of our communities.” Trump ’bets’ terror suspect not on a watch list, Pence acknowledged the difficult balance between smart policing and respecting civil liberties, but cited Rahami as an example of how political correctness can hinder law enforcement.

{"article": "After making it to the top, Barack Obama is looking down. In October, the outgoing president signaled that he will focus on   politics when he leaves office. This promise took on new urgency after the election, which left Republicans in control of 32 statehouses and 33 governor’s mansions, not to mention both chambers of Congress and the White House. “One of the big suggestions that I have for Democrats as I leave   …     is how do we do more of that   building?” the president told NPR in December. “What I’m interested in is just developing a whole new generation of talent. ” Obama seems to be taking part in the larger process of soul searching among Democrats. “I wonder, sometimes, whether the Democratic Party has contributed to [a decline in local politics] by making the president and the federal government the fulcrum of so much, and suggesting that we can solve these problems from the top down,” said David Axelrod, the former senior Obama administration advisor, during a recent panel discussion at the University of Chicago. “Democrats have ceded a lot of statehouses and legislatures. Congress has been gridlocked. And the notion has been: What can the president do with the power that he has to try and create some progressive action? It just puts a lot of weight on the presidency, when maybe we have to be a bit more innovative. ” The Atlantic  Politics  Policy Daily: Congress Clocks In, These explanations are not primarily philosophical. They’re about winning. In the face of painful electoral losses, Democrats are rediscovering the strategic case for activism at the state and local level. Yet there are deep historical and ideological reasons why the party has tended to focus on the federal government as a means of making policy. An ideological shift would be much more important, and is more unlikely, than a strategic one. As Democrats move to focus on state and local politics in 2017, this distinction between ideology and strategy will be important to watch. The party, and progressives more broadly, could take up a friendly posture toward state and local governance on the grounds that Americans should directly influence the laws that constrain them and the policies that supposedly benefit them. Alternatively, this sudden impulse toward state and local organizing could prove instrumental and temporary, doomed to reversal whenever the party wins back the U. S. Senate or the White House. Democrats’ approach to federalism will matter for the future of the party and the permanence of its policies. But ultimately, it will show what Democratic leaders really believe about people’s proper role in their government. For some progressives, a renewed focus on state and local politics is primarily about obstructing Washington Republicans. Heather Gerken, a Yale law professor, wrote a piece for Vox about why the left should embrace federalism in the coming years —  essentially, she argued, it offers ways to counteract federal policies. “Progressives at the state and local level can influence policy simply by refusing to partner with the federal government,” she wrote. “If blue states and cities refuse to implement Trump’s agenda, Republicans will sometimes be forced to compromise rather than pay a political and fiscal price. ” For others, local politics are more important in their own right. “We think there’s a lot of importance in protecting local democracy,” said Nikki Fortunato Bas, the executive director of the Partnership for Working Families, a network of regional advocacy organizations that work on economic and environmental issues. “It’s in the communities [where] we live [that] we’re most connected to the need of our neighbors, and lawmakers are most connected to the needs of their constituents. ” Regardless of their reasons for wanting to focus on state and local politics, Democrats will be limited by the enormous imbalances of party power in governors’ mansions, state legislatures, and city halls. Especially during Obama’s second term in office, the party lost control and influence in a number of statehouses. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, the party controls roughly half as many state legislatures as it did in 2010, and roughly half as many states will enter 2017 with a partisan split compared to the same year. Similarly, Democrats have been losing governships steadily since Obama took office in 2008: Compared to the 29 states held by Democrats that year, the party now holds 16. The only place where Democrats still dominate across the country is in large cities, where they control many city halls. The unevenness is partly a reflection of progressives’ reluctance to push their policy agendas through states. Historically, arguments against federalism —  or the principle that power should be robustly shared between state and national governments —  have centered on race. “Progressives are deeply skeptical of federalism, and with good reason,” Gerken wrote in a 2012 essay in Democracy. “States’ rights have been invoked to defend some of the most despicable institutions in American history, most notably slavery and Jim Crow. ” Others see the decentralization of governing power as a way of stifling dissent, she argued. This is one reason why the national Democratic Party has often looked to Washington to make and enforce policy. But there’s another ideological explanation, argued Ernest Young, a professor of law at Duke University, in an interview: The progressive project is ultimately about working toward a society built on one unified vision of policy and culture, rather than a diverse array of policies and cultures. “If you’re confident that you can get the right answer to something, like   policy, or welfare, or any number of very difficult social problems, it’s hard not to say that right answer should be equally available to everyone,” Young said, meaning that progressives believe their “right answers” should be legislated through federal policy. “If you’re a more Burkean type of conservative, and you’re skeptical that we’re ever going to find out right answers to these questions, you might favor different solutions in different jurisdictions, and see from experience what works out. That tends to lend itself to a commitment to federalism, and local governments, too,” he said. Not all progressives believe that most policymaking should happen at the federal level. Especially in recent years, some policymakers have looked to cities and municipalities to lead reform efforts. “Cities were the original sites of disruption: They disrupt class orders they disrupt social practices they disrupt businesses,” said Jennifer Bradley, the director of the Center for Urban Innovation at the Aspen Institute. No matter what Obama and other national Democrats may say, this work has already been in progress, she added. “This notion that Democrats were relying too heavily on the federal government is belied by eight years of what actually happened,” she said. In part because Washington is so dysfunctional, “cities and states have learned to rely less and less on the federal government, and I think that trend will sharply accelerate. ” Practically speaking, the narrative that progressives favor federal policymaking while conservatives favor state and local action is far too simplistic. Both parties tend to use federal power when they have it. “George W. Bush, as a matter of ideology, cared a lot about states,” Young pointed out. “But the first thing he did as president was to shift power to the federal government in the area of education, which had been a terribly important area of state predominance. ” Conversely, both parties have used   litigation to intervene in federal policymaking when they’ve been out of power. Take Massachusetts vs. Environmental Protection Agency, the   Supreme Court case in which 12 states, several cities, and advocacy groups sued to force the EPA to begin regulating greenhouse gases. During the Obama years, other states pulled a similar move —  Texas sued the administration over deferred immigration enforcement for people in the country illegally, for example. “Broadly, I think federalism is not a conservative or liberal thing, or a Republican or Democrat thing,” Young said. “It offers a way of not having all your eggs in one basket when changes in who controls various institutions occur. ” It’s also a way of making sure one party doesn’t force the other permanently out of power at the national level: As Democrats are now discovering, it’s hard to get elected in districts that   state legislatures have gerrymandered to favor their own party. But there’s a reason why the United States is not a constellation of    . Federalism is a political orientation, not a body of   policy prescriptions. The negotiation of power between national and state governments —  and, relatedly, between state and local governments —  is complicated and partisan. Larger bodies of government, led by Democrats and Republicans alike, often threaten smaller bodies with litigation or funding cuts if they don’t follow certain policies. During the Reagan years, the federal government famously used this method to get states to comply with its policy on the legal drinking age. And in 2016, the Obama administration used a similar method when it sent a letter to school districts instructing them to comply with federal guidance on accommodations for transgender students. States often write laws limiting cities from legislating certain issues as well. North Carolina’s H. B. 2 may have been the most notorious of these kinds of prohibitions in 2016: Among other things, the statute prohibited cities from passing   ordinances to protect LGBT residents. Preemption on LGBT issues is fairly new, according to the Partnership for Working Families. States preempt cities and municipalities most frequently on issues like transportation regulations,   standards, labor agreements, and policies on earned sick days, the organization reports. If national Democrats are truly interested in revitalizing state and local governance, perhaps they’ll push to repeal these kinds of preemption laws, which force policy decisions into the realm of larger and larger legislative bodies. Or maybe they’ll swear off executive orders, on which the Obama administration heavily relied, whenever they eventually regain federal power. It’s not like voters are big fans of the federal government, anyways: According to Pew Research Center, Americans’ trust in bodies like Congress has been declining for at least the last decade, while their belief in state and local bodies is much higher and has remained relatively constant over the years. This might be the most compelling of all arguments for a new era of federalism: Voters simply don’t like or trust the federal government. As a new administration prepares to take office, “The one thing I really hope states and locals can do is model a different kind of political behavior,” Bradley said. “What I would hope is that the actions of state and local lawmakers can restore people’s faith and trust, honestly, in democracy. ”", "prop": 0.4300031514785346},
{"article": " Brazil’s government has sharply increased spending in local infrastructure projects proposed by lawmakers, according to budget data reviewed by Reuters on Tuesday, as a graft scandal threatens to topple President Michel Temer. Federal spending on infrastructure works and other projects this year sponsored by congressman for their constituencies jumped to 1. 49 billion reais ($451 million) in June, up from 959 million reais the month before, the data showed.  As Brazil grapples with   budget deficits, the recent splurge illustrates Temer’s efforts to keep his fragmented coalition united despite growing calls for his resignation more than one year before general elections.   Temer’s office declined to comment on the increase in spending in the past month. Brazilian legislators can earmark the federal budget for local works, but the federal government must authorize that spending.  Brazil’s budget deficit before interest payments soared to 30. 736 billion reais ($9. 30 billion) in May, the   for the month. The gap in the 12 months through May reached 157. 7 billion reais, above the official target for a deficit of 143. 1 billion reais for this year. The increase in spending comes at a time when Temer is facing charges with taking millions of dollars in bribes in connection with a graft scheme involving the world’s largest meatpacker, JBS SA. Company executives said in   testimony that the president took bribes for resolving tax matters, freeing up loans from   banks and other matters. According to the testimony, Temer also allegedly arranged to receive a total of 38 million reais from JBS.  The president has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.   VOTE ON TEMER’S FATE Under Brazilian law, it is now up to the lower house of Congress to decide if the president will be tried by the Supreme Court.   of the lower house must vote to approve the charge for that to happen. Temer’s charge will first be voted on by the   Constitution and Justice Committee, which on Tuesday evening chose deputy Sergio Zveiter, from the president’s own Brazilian Social Democracy Party, to be the rapporteur for the case. Zveiter vowed to be independent and beholden ”only to the country.” The commission’s vote is expected by July 13.  Regardless of the commission’s decision, the full house must still vote on the charge against Temer. That full vote is expected to take place on July 14.             Rodrigo Janot last week said he would likely level new charges of racketeering and obstruction of justice against Temer in the coming weeks. Each charge would require lawmakers to vote on whether to defend the deeply unpopular president from being tried. Lawmakers within Temer’s coalition are confident they have the votes to block the   majority required to proceed with a trial. But they also acknowledge that if forced to vote on repeated charges against the president, support for the leader could unravel as lawmakers worry about their own   next year.

{"article": " U. S. President Barack Obama’s foreign policy legacy rests in part on a foundation of unilateral actions that his successor Donald Trump could reverse with the stroke of a pen. Due to take office on Jan. 20, Trump, the winner in Tuesday’s election, campaigned at times to dismantle Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran and to reimpose sanctions Obama eased on Cuba. Trump also disagreed with foreign policy decisions that included the way Obama has deployed troops abroad to combat Islamist militant groups. In his most notable foreign policy achievements, Obama, a Democrat, used executive authorities that offered a convenient legal path around a   Congress committed to blocking his agenda. The U. S. Constitution gives a president broad executive powers to enact foreign policy. Both Republican and Democratic presidents have sought to exercise those powers by issuing executive orders, presidential memoranda and what are called findings. ”He (Obama) relied on executive authority to build a foreign policy legacy,” said Thomas Wright, director of the Project on International Order and Strategy at the Brookings Institution.  ”That is all vulnerable to countervailing executive authority by a Trump administration,” Wright said. Obama had hoped to pass his legacy on to Democrat Hillary Clinton, his former secretary of state, but she lost the presidential election to Trump, a Republican businessman who has never held public office or served in the military.  TRUMP PLANS UNCLEAR Often contradicting himself during the campaign, Trump made it difficult to know for sure what policies he would pursue. Major constraints include budget caps, laws he cannot reverse without Congress, and the pressure that will emerge to replace policies he chooses to abandon. Trump said in an October speech that he would ”cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama” on his first day in office, without saying who would determine their constitutionality. A Trump spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday on his latest plans. EXECUTIVE ORDERS, ENACTED & RESCINDED Perhaps nowhere has Obama faced more congressional opposition than in his pursuit of the 2015 deal with Iran, which Republicans and some Democrats said put too few restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program in return for too much sanctions relief. Trump has vowed to dismantle it, although his statements on the deal have been contradictory. A president may tighten and relax economic sanctions by executive order. ”Anything enacted by executive order can be rescinded by executive order,” said Zachary Goldman, a former U. S. Treasury official now at New York University. Obama drew enough support from Democrats to block a   resolution rejecting the Iran deal, achieving a political victory but falling short of a consensus.  Trump will have the added advantage of working with a U. S. Senate and a House of Representatives controlled by fellow Republicans. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said on Wednesday he hoped Trump would ”see how much he can undo the unilateral actions the president took all by himself, which would not require us.” CUBA, DRONES Breaking with longstanding U. S. policy on another issue, Obama restored diplomatic ties with Cuba in 2015. But facing opposition in Congress to lifting a broad economic embargo, especially from Republicans, he used executive actions to ease some U. S. sanctions. Obama capped his Cuba efforts last month with a sweeping  ”presidential policy directive,” which also is reversible and sets forth mandates for government engagement,    exchanges, and greater U. S. business ties. Trump has taken contradictory positions on whether he supports the embargo or not. Obama’s aides said the easing of restrictions was aimed at securing enough benefits for U. S. businesses and travelers that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for any Republican president to reverse the opening to Cuba. Trump could roll back Obama’s efforts to create greater transparency about drone strikes. Obama issued an executive order in July requiring annual disclosures about such strikes. MILITARY POWER As    Trump will wield the power to mobilize the U. S. military on short notice and without first seeking approval from Congress. Obama deployed U. S. troops to Iraq, Syria and Libya to help fight the Islamic State militant group by relying on the authority Congress granted President George W. Bush to battle al Qaeda. That same authority would allow Trump to ramp up U. S. deployments in fights against Islamist militants if he chose to do so. One former U. S. intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the president can approve covert action and needs only to brief relevant leaders in Congress once the operation is under way. Trump’s powers, however, are limited. He pledged to expand the Army, grow the Marine Corps, boost the Navy from 276 to 350 ships and submarines, and raise the number of Air Force tactical aircraft from 1, 100 to 1, 200. For starters, that would require that Congress scrap government spending caps under the Budget Control Act. Trump’s support for   an interrogation technique that simulates drowning, also would meet opposition. Congress last year passed legislation barring the use of waterboarding and other ”extreme interrogation techniques” widely considered torture. Obama signed the measure into law last November.

{"article": "Here’s a surprise news flash: Millennials are getting more of their news on cable TV. In the first quarter, Fox News attracted the highest number of millennials  —   famously addicted to their smartphones  —   with 67, 700 of those aged between 18 and 34 tuning in. That’s up 250 percent from the same period two years ago, when just 27, 100 millennial viewers were glued to Fox News, according to Nielsen data obtained by The Post. CNN isn’t far behind. It grew millennial viewership to 62, 900 from 34, 800 in 2015, while MSNBC just notched 35, 900 in the first quarter versus 20, 400 in the comparable period two years earlier. To be sure, millennials are the first generation to grow up attached to their digital devices, and the latest   figures aren’t big numbers when compared with the hundreds of millions of   that social networks like Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat notch each month. Still, data show a surprising trend  —   namely, that all three news networks grew the number of young adults watching their broadcasts on both a   and   basis. “It’s really the political climate,” says Billie Gold, director of programming research at Amplifi, a division of ad agency Dentsu Aegis Network. Millennials are “very socially conscious. They care about the environment and all the protests  —   they’re very concerned. ” Nonstop chaos in Washington, an investigation into Russian interference in the elections, wiretapping claims and allegations of fake news have made watching the news a nonstop reality show of epic proportions. Ratings typically fall off a cliff after an election, but this year, the audiences have held up, Gold notes. With the TV “upfronts” looming  —   a seasonal confab in which advertisers look to allocate $70 billion in annual budgets around the dial  —   growth in the ranks of young viewers is a welcome data point for news networks that typically skew older. Millennials are a   demographic for advertisers, even though they’re more likely to still live with their parents than at any time since 1880, according to Pew Research. There are now 75. 4 million millennials, who overtook baby boomers last year as the biggest segment of the US population. The news segment is on fire. Fox News, CNN and MSNBC have been hitting record ratings at a time when both general cable and broadcast networks are struggling to hold on to their viewers. In February, broadcast networks lost 11 percent of the commercial ratings in prime time while cable networks were off 10 percent, according to a study dubbed “Winter Is Here,” from independent research firm MoffettNathanson released on Wednesday. Just six networks of the top 25 cable outlets could boast of growth in viewership. Anecdotally, several industry executives told The Post their   kids are sitting down to watch the news with them in the evenings. Digital destinations in the news category are gaining too, according to comScore. “Millennials’ news consumption is heavier than the average digital news consumer” said Andrew Lipsman, comScore’s vice president of corporate marketing.", "prop": 0.053159738662689755},
{"article": "Liberals are ecstatic that a judge in Hawaii is writing immigration policy for the entire country, and that policy is: We have no right to tell anyone that he can’t live in America. (Unless they’re Christians  —   those guys we can keep out. )[As subtly alluded to in the subtitle of Adios, America: The Left’s Plan to Turn Our Country into a Third World Hellhole, the goal of liberals is for the poor of the world to have a constitutional right to come here whenever they want.  I can’t help but notice that the Third Worlders aren’t moving to liberals’ neighborhoods. After nearly 1 million Rwandans were murdered by other Rwandans in 1994, our government asked itself: Why not bring more of this fascinating Rwandan culture to America? Ten thousand of them poured in. So far, nearly 400 have been convicted in the United States of lying on visa applications about their role in the genocide. And that’s why we have to tighten our belt, America! Massive international investigations don’t come cheap. Almost every immigration case is a con, something we find out every time there’s a San Bernardino shooting and half the familyturns out to have scammed our immigration officials. One hundred percent of the “humanitarian” cases are frauds. Earlier this month, Rwanda’s Gervais Ngombwa was convicted for lying on his immigration application by claiming to have been a victim of the 1994 genocide. In fact, he was a   perpetrator  —   even featured in Rwandan newspaper articles as a leader of the genocide. For most of the last two decades, Ngombwa has been living in Iowa with his wife and eight children in a house built by Habitat for Humanity  —   because no Americans need houses. He came to the authorities’ attention a couple years ago by setting that house on fire after a domestic dispute, then filing a fraudulent $75, 000 insurance claim. Another Rwandan genocidalist living in America was featured in Adios, America: Beatrice Munyenyezi, granted refugee status as an alleged victim of the genocide, even though she, too, had helped orchestrate it. Munyenyezi was living safely living in Kenya when she applied for a refugee visa to America. The welfare is way better here. And, luckily for us, she had a “chronic medical condition” that required constant attention from a New Hampshire hospital. Hesham Mohamed Hadayet arrived in the U. S. on a tourist visa, then immediately applied for “asylum” on the grounds that he was persecuted in Egypt  —   for being a member of an Islamic terrorist group. Being a member of a noted terrorist group cannot be used to block you from coming to America, thanks to Barney Frank’s 1989 amendment to the Immigration and Naturalization Act, because liberals love this country so very, very much. Being a talented neurosurgeon from Switzerland, however, is disqualifying. Hadayet’s refugee application wasn’t denied until he’d already been living here for three years. When he was called in for a visa overstay hearing, he didn’t show up, and the INS didn’t bother looking for him. After allowing Hadayet to mill about America for another year, our government granted him permanent residency and a work permit. On the Fourth of July following the   attack, Hadayet shot up the El Al ticket counter at the Los Angeles International Airport. I guess the Egyptians were right! As bodies were being cleared away from the ticket counter, including Hadayet’s, his wife blamed America for the attack, denying her husband had anything to do with it. “He is a victim of injustice,” she explained. “In America, they hate Islam and Arabs after Sept. 11. ” At least immigrants are grateful. Immigration bureaucrats are so determined to transform America without anyone seeing what they’re doing that the INS initially refused to release Hadayet’s file to congressional investigators, in order to protect his “privacy. ” Of course, anybody could miss Egypt’s designating someone a terrorist. And maybe the INS’s test for Rwandan “refugees” is: Would this person be able to convince Rolling Stone magazine that “Haven Monahan” raped her? How about Rasmea Yousef Odeh? She waltzed into America after having been convicted and imprisoned in Israel for a supermarket bombing that left two Hebrew University students dead, and also for the attempted bombing of the British consulate in Israel. She was released in a prisoner exchange  —   whereupon Odeh made a beeline for the U. S. True, Odeh wasn’t subjected to the   vetting accorded the humanitarian cases, like the Boston Marathon bombers (we were warned by Russia) Hadayet (we were warned by Egypt) or the Blind Sheik (same). But how did our immigration authorities miss a CONVICTION FOR BOMBING IN ISRAEL? Apart from the terrorism, welfare, and fraud, what great things did any of them do for our country? Ngombwa was a custodian at the Cedar Rapids Community School District in Iowa, a job that, evidently, no American would do. Munyenyezi had a job as an advocate for refugees  —   just one of the many jobs being created by immigrants. Hadayet ran a failing limousine company and was $10, 000 in debt. Odeh was an unemployed waitress and a Palestinian grievance activist. Recently, she’s been heavily involved in     male protests, because who doesn’t like incessant Third World unrest? In 1960, 75 percent of the   in America were from Europe. Today only about 10 percent are.

How is it making America better? Improving the schools? The job market? Crime? The likelihood of terrorism?

{"article": "’  ’ ’     In Britain, McDonald’s fries have four ingredients: potatoes,     vegetable oil, dextrose, and salt.   ’ ’     In the U. S. McDonald’s fries have a whopping 19     ingredients —  including sodium acid pyrophosphate, which keeps     the fries’ color from getting dull. This is strange since you’d     think that all we really expect of French fries is for them to     at least vaguely mimic the color of a potato.   ’ ’     Then there’s McDonald’s strawberry sundae. In Britain’s     version, all the color comes from real strawberries. In the     U. S. we use Red No. 40. This plays out beyond the fast food     chain: For example, Starburst fruit chews are colored with     carotenes and chlorophylls across the Atlantic but with Red No.     40 and Yellow No. 6 in the U. S. Many major food companies in     the U. S. use artificial food dyes in America —  while selling     naturally colored or   versions in Europe.   ’ ’   Chemicals like Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5, and Blue No. 1 make   American food look better. These additives are the culinary   equivalents of lipstick and mascara, and they are often made from   the same pigments. Making food pretty has become the status   quo in the U. S. but it’s not doing us any good: Not only does it   trick us into thinking some foods are healthier than they are,   but the dyes themselves may be harmful. So why do we use   keep using these dyes when so many other countries manage without   them? ’ ’   It wasn’t always this way. Until the     century, natural food dyes from   plants, animals, and minerals were used to color food in the U. S.   Things changed when companies discovered artificial dyes which   were cheaper, brighter, and more stable than their natural   counterparts. Artificial dyes made food look more attractive,   which made them popular with consumers. America is a relatively   young and expansive country, and a major historical concern   involved feeding a growing population while moving food large   distances. Food was treated like a commodity, with market forces   shaping what were most valued: cost, convenience, and appearance.   For decades, there was little push to fret —  as Europeans did —  about   what was actually in our food. We just wanted it to look good. ’ ’      Lancet  ’ ’  ’ ’   After the Lancet study was published, some   academic skeptics who had doubted parental claims that food dyes   affected the behavior of healthy children admitted they might   have been wrong. In 2010, the European Parliament passed a law   requiring warning labels on products with any of the six tested   food dyes, and banned the use of food dyes for infants and young   children, effectively ridding much of the European food   supply —  which had low amounts of artificial food dyes to begin   with —  of artificial food coloring. The doses used for some of the   kids in this study, 20 to 30 milligrams of artificial food   coloring, were not as high as those typically ingested by   American children —  in fact, kids often consume far higher doses   than what was found to be harmful in clinical trials. ’ ’   The Food and Drug Administration reacted differently to the same   evidence. A  stated   that a causal relationship between dyes and hyperactivity was not   conclusively established based on available research, though the   report conceded that dyes made symptoms worse in children with   ADHD and other preexisting behavioral problems. Since this report   was published, evidence that food dyes cause problems has   continued to mount.  stated that   the negative effects of food dyes on children’s behavior weren’t   confined to those with ADHD. The latest  from the Center for Science in the   Public Interest, released in January, lamented the FDA’s inaction   and cautioned, “the harm to children and the costs to society   from dyes are needless and preventable. ” ’ ’   It is true that pulling conclusive, universal findings from   scientific research is a difficult task. Sure, there may be   evidence suggesting harm from food additives, but some of the   research was performed in animals and may not apply to humans.   More   research is needed to determine what happens   when healthy people ingest typical doses of common food   additives. We still don’t understand exactly what could be   causing the negative effects food coloring seems to have on kids   with certain conditions. All of these caveats are important to   recognize. ’ ’   But when it comes to food coloring, why should we have to prove   just   exactly how and why the   substance causes a negative effect on the people who consume it   before we can ban it? If this were a necessary or meaningful food   ingredient in any way, sure, that would be a reasonable standard.   But food coloring has no nutritional value. Why are we risking   it? ’ ’     ’ ’  ’ ’   Most likely because it helps companies sell products. Pretty food   pays off because aesthetics in food do matter. We have relied on   visual cues for thousands of years to help us determine what is   edible, nutritious, and safe to eat. Man has adapted to   appreciate natural colors, including a variety of green, red,   pink, orange, yellow, and purple produce: Colors signal that food   is ripe or that it contains healthy compounds. Because of that   evolutionary background, color is money for food manufacturers.   Children are especially attracted to a variety of bright, vibrant   colors and succumb to targeted marketing. Food dyes make   processed food more appealing. For example, margarine was   originally white —  manufacturers wanted to tint it yellow to appeal   to the public. Butter producers objected, saying this would   deceive the public. (In fact, butter is also naturally pale and   dyed yellow.) ’ ’   Food aesthetics can also affect how we perceive   taste.  when subjects   were given sugar water in different shades of red, they reported   that the deep red drinks tasted sweeter than the light red ones.   We’ve been primed to expect certain things from certain   colors:  showed   people had a harder time identifying drink flavors when the   drinks didn’t have the expected colors (an   drink   that was really   tasted like an orange). We expect   what nature has taught us, and even though our food system has   changed radically in the past several decades, our expectations   have yet to catch up. Food companies can instead use this   knowledge to trick us and make their processed products appear   more palatable. ’ ’   The reason why food coloring is still allowed is wrapped up in   the different approach the U. S. takes to food regulation. A key   element of the European Union’s public health protection policy   is the “precautionary principle,” under which credible evidence   of danger to human health merits protective action despite   scientific uncertainty. Unlike the EU, the U. S. government sets   high standards for proof of harm before regulatory action is   taken. In fact, the FDA’s “Generally Recognized as Safe” (GRAS)   designation, introduced in 1958, allows companies to evaluate   their own substances and deem them acceptable themselves, after   which the FDA can review the evaluation —  if it wants to. While   this makes sense for ingredients like salt and pepper, GRAS lets   producers take new food additives to the market without even   informing the FDA. Trans fat was classified as GRAS until the   label was withdrawn in 2015. ’ ’   As ingredient lists in other parts of the world show us, it’s   possible to still get basically the same experience without the   potentially negative consequences. Consumer demand can drive   change. Parents and activists have been petitioning food   companies to remove dyes for years, and some are   obliging: In February, candy giant Mars agreed to remove   artificial food coloring in all of its human food products over   the next five years. Mars’ recent decision echoes those made by   other food industry behemoths including Kraft, Nestle, and   General Mills. We’re lucky to have producers take this action,   but we shouldn’t have to wait for their benevolence. ’ ’     Last month, six former commissioners of the FDA met in Aspen,     Colorado, to critique the agency. They pointed out that     thousands of food additives are a part of our food system     because of the GRAS loophole, one that leaves safety decisions     to the producers rather than the FDA. We should tell the FDA     that we demand more: It is their job to keep us safe from these     unnecessary chemicals. In the quandary over brighter mac and     cheese and the risk of hyperactivity, the answer is easy —  let’s     tone down our food.   ’", "prop": 0.0031145084751921224},
{"article": " (CNN) Well, I’ll be the first to admit, I got caught off guard on this one. If indeed the assessment of the cockpit voice recording of Germanwings Flight 9525’s final moments is an accurate one, it is shocking. It is inconceivable to me that a fellow pilot would use an airplane for his demise and the demise of his passengers. It is my hope that there is more to this uncanny, horrific tragedy than just an extraordinary suicide event. Although a report of normal breathing from the   in the moments before the crash indicates that he was not incapacitated, how can one really tell? A farfetched idea, but could he have suffered a fit of schizophrenia never diagnosed, or suffered some other mental disorder, perhaps brought on by medication? I know, it’s not likely. As an airline pilot, I’m taking this incident personally. Why? A pilot betrayed the public trust. With all the other fears    terrorism, disappearances of planes, aircraft malfunctions    how do I reassure my passengers that they should not add medical illness, mental or otherwise, of the pilot to the list? For the moment, I’ll have to believe that my customers are intelligent enough to realize that the Germanwings   is an anomaly. Sure, as with any profession, pilots have isolated cases of   troubles. But we have mechanisms to deal with such problems. One mechanism is very simple: Don’t fly. It is incumbent upon us to determine our own fitness for duty. As a matter of fact, on every trip, I have to confirm that status before I electronically sign the flight plan. Whether it’s as simple as suffering from the common cold or suffering from the distraction of a nasty divorce, airline pilots can just say ”no” to flying. As part of the hiring process, we completed a psychological evaluation. With my airline, one part of the evaluation involved a written test that asked obscure questions in different ways. Another part of the test involved pilots listening to an air traffic control recording made during the angst of a thunderstorm event while at the same time completing a battery of math and   problems. We were then asked questions specific to the conversations between the air traffic controllers and pilots we’d heard in the recording. The test was a measure of our multitasking abilities and our abilities to deal with stress. In addition, the airline’s doctor conducted an individual mental evaluation. Airline pilots in the United States are required by the Federal Aviation Administration to take a medical examination once every six months. The examination is mostly physical, but the doctor is expected to ask some basic mental health questions, most of them about depression or alcohol consumption. In addition to requiring pilots to indicate any prior health issues during the previous six months, the application for the exam also compels us to   the use of medications, specifically for the treatment of depression.  If we have consulted a therapist, that also has to be disclosed. Yes, all bets are off if we deceive the system by hiding things from it, but by every indication, this rarely occurs. The consequence for deception is having your FAA pilot’s license suspended. When it comes to experiencing stress, airline pilots are no different than anyone else. But we tend to deal with stress internally. I have been trained as a peer support volunteer in   stress management, a joint program between the pilots union and my airline uses as a debriefing method to talk pilots through any serious event experienced in flight.  The idea is to mitigate any   stress associated with such an event, and occasionally the process would uncover personal issues that would be referred to other support providers, like mental health professionals. I have found that my colleagues demonstrate an   ability to compartmentalize their problems and not let personal issues affect their job performance . .. most of the time, of course.  If personal issues invade the cockpit, mechanisms are in place to assist. What mechanisms? At my airline, both the company and the pilot’s union work in unison. Programs to assist a pilot experiencing problems are just a phone call away. And if there is concern about a colleague’s mental health, we can contact one of these programs on the other pilot’s behalf, anonymously if necessary. In some circumstances a pilot can be removed from duty. At every recurrent training period, the curriculum includes a presentation reminding us of these mechanisms. No system is perfect. Yes, as with all human systems, somebody will fall through the cracks. Even a good psychiatrist can miss an impending suicide. Redesigning an airplane cockpit based on the infinitesimal chance that another Germanwings   is out there seems like an overreaction.  If passengers require reassurance of my sanity, then it would be best to more actively promote the mechanisms already in place. We can start with education.

{"article": "       You can see the exact moment last week that Donald Trump made up his mind on whether women would face criminal punishment once he signed new restrictions into law. He is at a town hall with MSNBC’s Chris Matthews, and, after Matthews badgers him for a while, he finally answers the question. “The answer is . .. that,” Trump says, eyes looking to the side in thought, “there has to be some form of punishment. ” He punctuates “has” with a hand gesture. Done. Final.     But as it turns out  —   and as it has turned out repeatedly over the course of his life  —   that was not, in fact, Trump’s final position on the subject. This past week alone, he has held multiple contradicting positions, including that one. So we figured that a timeline was in order, so that you could see the date and time and know, concretely, what Trump’s abortion position was at that moment. Though he might deny it. April 1989 Trump   a dinner at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan (which he then owned) honoring Robin Chandler Duke, a former president of NARAL. He chose not to attend, the New York Times reported, after his family was threatened by   activists. Oct. 24, 1999 Ten years later, Trump appeared on NBC in an interview with Tim Russert. In a clip that has received newfound life during this election cycle, Trump defends his broadly liberal positions by explaining that he grew up in Manhattan, not Iowa. Asked about abortion, he’s clear.  “I’m very ” Trump says. “I hate the concept of abortion. I hate it. I hate everything it stands for. I cringe when I listen to people debating the subject. But you still  —   I just believe in choice. ” Russert clarifies his original point: Would you ban   abortion? “No,” Trump replies. Between 1999 and 2011 At some point between 1999 and 2011, Trump’s position on abortion changed. He explained the reason for his switch during the first debate of 2015. [W]hat happened is friends of mine years ago were going to have a child, and it was going to be aborted. And it wasn’t aborted. And that child today is a total superstar, a great, great child. And I saw that. And I saw other instances. In 2011, as he was toying with running, he told activists at the Conservative Political Action Conference that, among other conservative positions, “I am   [and] against gun control. ” June 28, 2015 Shortly after announcing his candidacy, Trump appeared on CNN in an interview with Jake Tapper. He got a little tripped up. TAPPER: Let me ask you about a few social issues because they haven’t been issues you have been talking about for several years. I know you’re opposed to abortion. TRUMP: Right. I’m  . TAPPER: You’re   or  ? TRUMP: I’m  . I’m sorry. March 30, 2016, 2:30 p. m. The interview with Matthews is taped, and Trump asserts that women who receive abortions once the procedure is illegal will face punishment. The men are involved will not, he adds. News of the comments quickly leaks. March 30, 2016, 3:30 p. m. Before the MSNBC town hall even airs, a spokesperson for Trump releases a statement changing what he told Matthews.   . @realDonaldTrump statement on abortion: says it should be put back to the states and he’s pro life, like Reagan. pic. twitter.   —   Ali Vitali (@alivitali) March 30, 2016  March 30, 2016, 5 p. m. About an hour later, Trump’s campaign releases a more formal “statement regarding abortion. ” It’s different than what he said to Matthews and his initial statement. “If Congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts upheld this legislation, or any state were permitted to ban abortion under state and federal law,” the statement says, “the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman. ” (It’s worth noting that this is in line with the   movement’s position.) The statement includes a snippet written in the first person: “My position has not changed  —   like Ronald Reagan, I am   with exceptions. ” April 1, 2016, 6:30 p. m. CBS releases an excerpt of its interview with Trump that aired Sunday morning. Asked again about abortion, Trump’s position seems to change yet again. “The laws are set now on abortion and that’s the way they’re going to remain until they’re changed,” he said, according to CBS’s transcript. “I would’ve preferred states’ rights. I think it would’ve been better if it were up to the states. But right now, the laws are set. ... At this moment, the laws are set. And I think we have to leave it that way. ” Understandably, this is not  . The   group Susan B. Anthony List replies that he had “disqualified himself as the GOP nominee” if this were his position. Trump also offered a reason for his initial comments to Matthews: “I’ve been told by some people that was an older line answer and that was an answer that was given on a, you know, basis of an older line from years ago on a very conservative basis. ” April 1, 2016, 9 p. m. Again before the program airs, the Trump campaign   what the candidate said. “Mr. Trump gave an accurate account of the law as it is today and made clear it must stay that way now  —   until he is president,” it read. “Then he will change the law through his judicial appointments and allow the states to protect the unborn. There is nothing new or different here. ” Should Mr. Trump’s position on abortion not be anything new or different again in the future, this article will be updated.

{"article": " (CNN) There’s a pioneering education nonprofit in Boston that uses stories of past bigotry to teach young people about tolerance. It’s called ”Facing History and Ourselves.” Which pretty much sums up our national challenge for the foreseeable future. Last week, when the Rachel Dolezal media circus was in full swing, the subtext of the coverage and debate was that ”this is all so fascinatingly 21st century.” Coming so soon after Caitlyn Jenner’s transgender declaration, Dolezal’s masquerade raised convoluted, sometimes comical questions about whether it is possible or permissible now to claim race as a matter of mere personal preference. The shooting in Charleston ended that   reverie.  The vicious killings at the Emanuel AME Church on Wednesday reminds us brutally that race in 2015 isn’t only about fluid boundaries, elective minority status, or a postmodern sense of identity in transition. Race    for   especially    is still often a hard social marker. In this case, a target.  There is a sickness in our society, as Senator Rand Paul said, that is about violence and mental illness. But there is a deeper sickness    race hatred    which is ”weaponized” by such easy access to guns. And underlying that is a deeper sickness still: the American penchant for avoiding the past and its meaning. Today    Thursday, June 18    the United States Supreme Court, with Justice Clarence Thomas as the pivotal vote, ruled that Texas is within its rights to ban Confederate flag license plates. Today, the    continues to fly at a Confederate Soldiers Monument in South Carolina. Today, images of Dylann Roof posing with that flag or the flags of   South Africa and Rhodesia went viral. Today is not, as the cliché goes, the first day of the rest of your life. Today is the most recent day of the many lives that came before yours. Rachel Dolezal’s ”race, lies, and videotape” farce was the product of her desire to escape her own history, to claim another group’s history. She could not. She should not have tried.  The Charleston shooting, rooted in a deep tradition of   violence, is also part of an inescapable history. There are too many anguished echoes to tally. There are the church bombings of the civil rights era just half a century ago. There are the lynchings, murders, bombings, riots, and rapes that were the enforcement arm of the unwritten codes of segregation. There is the violence, physical and legal, done to slaves since before there was a Constitution or a United States. This racialized violence was used to make and enforce boundaries of race    and let’s be clear, to define race in terms of blackness versus  . It was not an incidental aspect of the American republic, the Confederate rebellion, or   revivalism today. It is at the very core of our nation’s history and contemporary civic life. We have to reckon with it much more openly. Not ”without judgment,” as people are prone to say in this time of fragile feelings, but with quite strong judgment of history and ourselves: with a   sense that it is possible and necessary both to damn racism and to admit how much of it exists in our own hearts. Except we shouldn’t wait for another Lincoln. We should each, in our own little domains, be another Lincoln. We should open conversations, public and private, about the real history of   racialism as well as racism in our institutions    our churches, our colleges, our companies, our town squares and public buildings.  And not just in the Deep South. That’s too easy. Not even just in a city like Spokane, Washington, which has few  . But also in every part of the North and West where the Great Migration of nearly a century ago changed the face of the big cities. In every part of New England, where so many great arts and education institutions were built on the labor of slaves. You might ask what good all this excavation of the past will do. It won’t equalize educational or economic opportunity for  . It won’t guarantee the voting rights of   citizens. It won’t protect   from police brutality or common criminality. But it will remind us why those tasks matter morally and urgently    and why the hashtag #AllLivesMatter is a defensive and   response to #BlackLivesMatter. It will make us all appreciate the responsibility we share as inheritors of all that is good    and bad    about America.  It’s the American way to blissfully forget history, to think only about tomorrow. But for the slain in Charleston there is no tomorrow. Those of us who are here today must face yesterday squarely, and commit to making a ”new American way ”    of reckoning, reconciliation, and true reconstruction.  Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

{"article": "Thursday night’s   from which the barbaric Assad regime’s   attack against its own people was launched was both   and modest. It was modest because it was focused, targeted and limited. Its specific purpose was to degrade the regime’s ability to work its evil again. In his brief statement, President Trump did not make broad claims or suggest further action was in the offing. He expressed appropriate outrage at the murder of children with gruesome banned weapons, but based his action in   terms  —   as punishment for Bashir   violating the terms of the Chemical Weapons Convention of which Syria is a signatory. The use of sarin, he said, is a threat to the “US and its allies. ” The president is right. Chemical weapons need not, after all, be delivered by plane. They can be carried by individuals and released in confined spaces like the Toyko subway system, where a 1995 sarin attack by terrorists resulted in death and horrible injury to dozens and incidental injuries to more than 5, 000 people. Over the past four years, Assad has been making commonplace what was once all but unthinkable  —   the deployment of a weapon of mass destruction against a civilian population. And he has been able to make it commonplace because the United States under Barack Obama repeatedly refused to respond to these acts of savage barbarity. And this is why I say the military strike was   as well as modest. In the first major test of Trump’s mettle as president, he has just put the world on notice: He is charting his own course in response to   events. This response seems to contradict many things he has said over the past four years about what the United States should do in Syria, and to overrun the words his own secretary of state spoke about Syria last week. That makes this militarily modest action even more geopolitically meaningful. Trump is signaling that his   tweets and his campaign’s naked appeals to isolationism may now be past their   date. Indeed, he sounded less like a cynical realist than a  —   dare I say it?  —   neoconservative. The rhetoric of his brief statement was striking for its moralism: “We ask for God’s wisdom as we face the challenge of our very troubled world,” he said. “We hope that as long as America stands for justice, then peace and harmony will in the end prevail. ” Contrast this with two months ago, when he responded to Bill O’Reilly asking him about Vladimir Putin’s record of killing people with shocking insouciance: “What,” Trump said, “do you think our country’s so innocent?” What a difference a sarin gas attack makes. And North Korean missile tests. Trump approved the strike with the prime minister of China in his company. Xi Jinping and Trump are meeting this weekend with the key subject now being the increasingly belligerent and provocative regime in North Korea. For more than a decade, we have been looking to China to act to end the nuclear ambitions of North Korea by threatening to cut off that regime’s economic lifeline. China has basically refused to act.

{"article": "Donald Trump faces a   presidential debate on Sunday night after a torrid 10 days left him trailing Hillary Clinton in opinion polls in key battleground states. With early voting already under way, the Republican candidate has seen his September polling gains wiped out and is fast running out of time to shift momentum back his way in the race for the White House. A live debate always raises the prospect of the   Trump allowing Clinton to get under his skin and making a gaffe that could throw his campaign into disarray. The bombastic billionaire stirred fresh controversy on Friday when, in a meeting with a union representing border patrol agents, he floated a new conspiracy theory, saying that immigration officials were trying to expand the pool of American voters. Trump directly challenged the media to report his remarks, which followed comments by union   Art Del Cueto in a meeting in Trump Tower in New York. Del Cueto told the celebrity businessman: “Immigration is so tied up with trying to get the people who are on the waiting list to hurry up and get them their immigration status corrected . .. so they can go ahead and vote before the election. ” “Big statement, fellas,” Trump said, motioning to reporters. “You’re not going to write it. That’s huge. But they’re letting people pour into the country so they can go and vote. ” Clinton was widely judged the winner of the first debate. Both candidates face a test of stagecraft on Sunday in what has become popularly known as a “town hall” format for their second showdown in St Louis, Missouri, moving around a stage with handheld microphones as they field questions from voters. The first town hall debate was held during the 1992 election. As a voter stood to ask George H W Bush about the national debt, the president glanced down at his watch, an image that seemed to reinforce criticism that he lacked empathy. Clinton’s husband Bill won the election. In 2000 George W Bush was answering a question on leadership during such a forum when   Al Gore rose from his chair and walked peculiarly close to his Republican rival. Bush turned and gave Gore a nod and a smile, prompting audience laughter.  Rick Tyler, a political analyst and former spokesperson for Republican primary candidate Ted Cruz, said of Trump: “From what I can tell from the polls, his prospects in the election are bleak. He’s going to need a   win in the debate if he’s going to stand any chance in November. ”  But the town hall format will not necessarily suit him. “He’s just not an impressive performer when it comes to answering people’s questions,” Tyler added. “He’s not grounded in policy, foreign or domestic. He doesn’t give a lot of thought to issues. He’s missing empathy when someone asks a question, he has trouble connecting at their level. “I think she’ll win it. She has so much more experience at this. She comes across as cold, but she has more skills than he does. ” According to the Real Clear Politics polling average, Clinton is currently 4. 5 points ahead of her Republican opponent in a   race, a poll position that would translate to at least 237 of the 270 electoral college votes she needs to win firmly in the bag, with 165 for Trump and 136 to play for.  There is a glimmer of hope for Trump, however, in polls that show him down but not out in the key swing states that are likely to determine the election outcome, and that suggest his dismal showing in the first debate had only a marginal impact. A survey by Quinnipiac University on 8 September, taking smaller parties into account, gave Clinton a  % lead over Trump in Florida,  % in North Carolina and  % in Pennsylvania. It had Trump up by  % in Ohio. Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, told a conference call on Friday: “Debates are obviously the kind of events that make it possible to have   influence. Right now it’s a pretty fair consensus of our polls and other people’s polls that Secretary Clinton seems to have a small lead, maybe three, four, five points nationally. “In some of the swing states, there’s some results that are just plain different. So we enter the next debate with Mrs Clinton slightly ahead but not gigantically ahead. The other interesting question is how the debates will affect the presidential race. ” The Quinnipiac survey found that likely voters said by margins of more than    that Clinton won the first debate. Brown added: “The poll taken right after that debate happened found there had been a relatively small increase in support for Mrs Clinton, not nearly as large as one might expected given the overwhelming consensus that Mrs Clinton won that debate. ” Brown noted that a large percentage of the electorate in states such as Florida and Ohio will have voted by election day due to   provisions in those states. This is likely to intensify pressure on Trump to arrest Clinton’s momentum. Ahead of Sunday, Trump has reportedly reviewed video of the first presidential debate, and his aides have stressed a need to stay calm and not get riled. He limbered up at a real town hall on Thursday night in New Hampshire but did not interact directly with the audience, taking questions only from a moderator. Trump told the small crowd: “This isn’t practice this has nothing to do with Sunday. This isn’t practice, we just wanted to be here. ” And he made fun of Clinton for preparing in depth. “I said, ‘Forget debate prep.’ I mean, give me a break. She’s resting. She wants to build up her energy for Sunday night. And you know what? That’s fine. But the narrative is so foolish. ” Trump was joined by New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who performed well in the town hall format during his failed presidential campaign and is helping the nominee get ready. The Clinton camp has said it expects Trump to have done more homework this time. “But even if he does show up a little more disciplined than last time, I don’t think he’ll get a second chance to make a first impression,” Clinton spokesperson Brian Fallon said.", "prop": 0.09908682157204787},
{"article": " The EPA on Tuesday named its first 10 hazardous chemicals  —   most notably asbestos  —   to a new roster of workplace or home health hazards that may result in some of the chemicals being banned. Largely composed of industrial solvents, flame retardants, and workplace cleaners, the announcement of the new list kicks off a   overhaul of how the environmental agency regulates dangerous chemicals. “We now have the power to require safety reviews of all chemicals in the marketplace,” EPA official Jim Jones said in a statement. A June law had required the first 10 chemicals to be named by Dec. 19. Asbestos, a   material that causes mesothelioma cancer, was widely expected to be on the list. Naming the chemicals to the list begins a   review that might lead to their ban. According to the American Chemistry Council, “a chemical’s inclusion in this first group of ten chemicals does not in and of itself indicate anything about the safety of the chemical. ” The industry group said they expected the EPA to conduct detailed risk evaluations before making any decisions on the use of the chemicals. “In order to help ensure the most credible results, it is imperative that EPA engage stakeholders early and often throughout the risk evaluation process, including through peer review and public comment,” the ACC said in a statement. The 10 chemicals on the list are: Asbestos, Carbon Tetrachloride, Cyclic Aliphatic Bromide Cluster, Methylene Chloride,   Pigment Violet 29, Tetrachloroethylene (also known as PERC or dry cleaning fluid)    and  . “While this is an important milestone, this list is just the first 10 of 1, 000 chemicals in need of urgent EPA review,” Scott Faber of the Environmental Working Group said in a statement. He noted the June law also doesn’t cover cosmetics and similar consumer chemicals. One disappointment for environmental groups was the new list did not include lead, known to be a health hazard for decades. Lead was most recently the cause of a public health disaster in Flint, Michigan, where water pipe corrosion led to its widespread diffusion in drinking water. “It is tragic that while children continue to be exposed to ongoing, unnecessary uses of lead in consumer products, EPA is not even starting the process of phasing out these uses with its new authority to regulate toxic substances,” attorney Eve Gartner of the environmental group, Earthjustice told BuzzFeed News by email.

Trump for president because: “He gets it. ”[“You got a businessman, who knows how to run things, knows how to get things done —  he’s going to have the aggressiveness America needs to have,” said John “Tig” Tiegen, a Marine veteran. Along with Mark “Oz” Geist, a Marine veteran Kris “Tanto” Paronto, an Army Ranger veteran and Dave “Boon” Benton, a Marine veteran and trained sniper, Tiegen contributed to the book 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi.  The book chronicles their fight to beat back repeated attacks along with former Navy SEALs Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, who were killed along with Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and State Department IT specialist Sean Smith on Sept. 11, 2012. Another former Navy SEAL fighting with them is given the cover name of Jack DaSilva. Tiegen said he endorsed Trump for president and was thrilled to have a Monday night slot addressing the Republican National Convention. The Marine said he and his comrades have met Trump and came away impressed by his sincere interest in their story and its lessons for American leaders. “We got to ask him questions and to see if he would give us the political answer or the straight up answer,” he said. “You know? He gave us the straight up answer. Didn’t try to   anything or answer our question with a question. ” Although he and Geist are stepping up to help Trump win the White House, he said the book and their story was not meant to be political, it was meant to be a testimony to the bravery of the four men killed that night. “We just wanted to make sure the four guys were being honored correctly,” he said. “To bring politics into the story of that night would be a dishonor to them. We weren’t fighting for our political parties, you know? We were fighting for each other —  to get out of there alive. ” The Marine said there is still a question about why the Pentagon did not send help that night. It could be something about former President Bill Clinton and his wife,   of State Hillary Clinton, Tiegen said. As president, Clinton abandoned the Army Rangers fighting in Mogadishu and the secretary of state abandoned the 30 personnel  in Benghazi, he said. “You don’t have to be in uniform, to me, the average American always thinks: ‘Hey, if Americans are in trouble, the troops are going to come for you.’ It seems like under the Clintons, they don’t do that. ” When the House Select Committee on Benghazi came out with its final report, Tiegen said he stopped reading it when he got to the part about how the Air Force was unable to send fighter jets because their planes were all broken down for a parts inventory. “Every one in the military knows they are lying when they say a whole entire Air Force base overseas was shut down all the planes were down for maintenance or for training,” he said. “For me that was the red flag, I knew I didn’t have to read their report no more, because I knew they were lying —  that never happens. It doesn’t happen in the U. S. so you know it doesn’t happen overseas on   —  they’re covering somebody’s behind —  maybe they were offered a job with the Clinton Foundation? I don’t know. ” There were military units and assets available to help, such as the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, he said. “The 24th MEU, they were about four hours away from Benghazi. An MEU is a battalion of Marines. They have aircraft that could get there. They have jets that can get there. ” USS Jason Dunham, an   destroyer, was six miles off the coast, he said. “If that ship is there, then there have to be other ships close by, too. ” Privately, people have reached out to Tiegen and his comrades from the Benghazi raid with stories from the inside, such as inside U. S. Africa Command, about what really happened, he said. “We had guys contact us, who were in AfriCom, and they said: ‘Yes, the State Department told us to stand down. ’” Tiegen said, “If I was getting ready to join the military right now, I wouldn’t do it. I’d wait to see who is getting elected —  if it is another Clinton, you don’t know if they have your back if something happens. They will just leave you to hang out to dry. ” With a Clinton in charge, it is hard to make military decisions, he said. “Either a bunch of your guys get blown up or shoot a guy on a motorcycle —  it’s happening all the time over there  —  they don’t know who they can shoot, so that everybody comes home —  because if they shoot the wrong guy, they go to prison. ” Similarly, President Barack Obama has stymied military   and execution because of his emphasis on political loyalty, he said. Generals and admirals who spoke up against the president were fired and relieved, creating a collection of flag officers who place career advancement before duty, he said. “It is really disheartening to know that the generals care more about the politics than what is actually is going on,” he said. “Now, you got all these pansies up in the Joint Chiefs of Staff,” he said. “They have no cojones. They’re going to leave 30 Americans out to die because they have a brunch they have to go to —  like I keep saying: ‘If Pearl Harbor’ was held today, we’d be screwed. We’d all be speaking Japanese. ’”", "prop": 0.07483910714674873},

{"article": " Cauliflower had become Lauren Hetrick’s   vegetable. “We have it as often as possible,” says the Rockville mother of three. “Once we roasted it, my kids really liked it  —   and they’ll eat anything if you put cheese on it. ”  But for weeks, Hetrick was unable to find any cauliflower, anywhere. Her quest for it “became a joke,” she says. “I went from grocery to grocery,” futilely stalking the elusive object of her family’s desire. “If I found cauliflower, it was $6 and a really little head, like the size of your hand. That’s not going to feed anyone. Well, maybe the guinea pig. ” These are heady times for cauliflower. High demand, unseasonably cool temperatures in farming regions and limited supply are resulting in scarcity or absurd prices for the latest “it” food. How absurd? You may want to sit down for this: $7. 99 for an organic head at the Takoma Park Silver Spring  . In Philadelphia, Weavers Way Food   suspended stocking the vegetable for three weeks out of concern that the lofty price tag would discourage buyers. But demand persisted. Produce Alliance, a consultant to produce distributors, reported in the Christmas week edition of its market review that cauliflower, the veggie that uprooted king kale, was  —   not to get too technical  —   in “ACT OF GOD” status.   Chefs are using cauliflower in various ways, including on pizza. (Stacy Zarin   The Washington Post)  In layman’s terms, this means “high prices and NONEXISTENT supply. ” (The   alarm is the Alliance’s doing. Vegetable shortages apparently make some people extremely anxious.) Long the bland steamed side dish routinely raked around the dinner plate, surreptitiously fed to pets and plants (not that we speak from experience) or cloaked in   cheese sauce in a (mostly failed) effort to fool the family, cauliflower has become beyond cool. It’s as though the kid you ignored through elementary and middle school, to say nothing of excluding from basement   parties, grew up to become the Jennifer Lawrence of cruciferous vegetables. “Cauliflower is getting its time in the limelight and finally getting some love,” confirms Lorri Koster, a   vegetable supplier in California’s Salinas Valley. It’s certainly a favorite of chefs, who are serving   pizza, cauliflower rice, cauliflower cupcakes, General Tso’s cauliflower,   cauliflower, cauliflower patties and cauliflower mash. Chef Dan Barber of New York’s Blue Hill has a celebrated cauliflower steak with cauliflower puree, a timely dish now that cauliflower costs almost as much as steak. And, yes, cauliflower ice cream is a thing.  [D. C. chefs are making cauliflower a star]  A     veggie that can behave like a carb, cauliflower is a monster in the popular Paleo diet, because “it substitutes for rice,” says Paleo blogger Russ Crandall, who runs the Domestic Man website. His readers frequently request cauliflower recipes. CrossFit fanatics, too, are deeply enamored of the   member of the Brassica family. “I’ve been eating more of it than I have in my entire life,” says Bryant Boucher, a CrossFit instructor in Frisco, Colo. who follows recipes on Paleoplan. com. “I fool myself that it’s rice or mashed potatoes. ” Add to these cravings unseasonably cool weather at California and Arizona farms, and you have the makings of a major shortage. Koster says that her firm normally ships 60, 000 cartons a week, each box containing a dozen to 15 heads, but the frost has zapped shipments to 5, 000. “The way demand escalated really caught us off guard,” she says. Which makes for some desperate shoppers, who’ll pay any price to get their hands on the coveted crucifer. “People get crazy about it,” said Robert Cahill, filling orders earlier this week at the Whole Foods in Plymouth Meeting, Pa. for Instacart, an online grocery shopping service. “They’re not happy about the prices, but they’re buying. ” For some, half a head is better than none. When the price spiked to $7, “I split the cost with a friend,” said resourceful shopper MirnaWay of Philadelphia. “We cut the cauliflower right in half. ” Chefs are feeling the pinch, too. Cauliflower is a “huge staple” in Mike Isabella’s collection of Washington restaurants. The   item at his G on 14th Street and at Nationals Park  —   bigger than chicken parm! bigger than the Italian sub!  —   is the $9 roasted cauliflower hero with pickled vegetables, paprika and romesco sauce. Washington has gone from a    town to a     town. “It probably costs me $8 to make it right now,” says Isabella of the sandwich, as the price of cauliflower “has doubled over the past few weeks. ” “It’s kind of scary,” he says, again demonstrating that produce can produce fear, “but we’re not going to change the prices. ” Whew!  [Mike Isabella is a (grand) mama’s boy]  Cauliflower’s time was long in coming. For decades, it was “in broccoli’s shadow. Now it’s the star of the show,” says Christine Keller of CCD Innovation, a food industry trend analyst that pronounced cauliflower the kale of 2015. This year, the firm is crushing on kelp, the vegetable formerly known as seaweed. But Keller says there’s also another    a vegetable so cool it has yet to make the trend report: kohlrabi. “Have you tried it?” she swoons about the turnip cabbage. “Delicious. ” Meanwhile, cauliflower relief may be in sight. Hetrick finally found   heads at the Safeway last weekend for $6, a relative bargain. Another cold snap, though, and those dollar signs could multiply again. In which case, you may have to help yourself to a dollop of kelp. ", "prop": 0.029786026037744034},
{"article": "Washington (CNN) Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump could announce his running mate pick before the party’s convention to help drum up excitement heading into Cleveland, a source familiar with the process told CNN.  Trump, who has repeatedly said his choice for vice president was down to as few as four candidates though sources tell CNN the list is closer to seven, and his aides had previously said the pick would likely be announced at the convention. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich are among the finalists, sources confirmed to CNN on Thursday. Christie    a former Trump rival turned top defender    has received the official paperwork for the vetting process, according to a source with knowledge of events. And Gingrich is being ”seriously considered” for the job, a Trump adviser said. In choosing either Christie and Gingrich, Trump would satisfy his desire for someone with political experience who could help him advance his legislative agenda through Congress. The New York Times was first to report Christie’s vetting. The Washington Post reported Thursday evening that Gingrich was also being vetted, with Sens. Jeff Sessions,   and Bob Corker,   also emerging as final contenders, but a source very close to the campaign said the Post’s report was inaccurate. The source added, however, that a surprise choice could also be in store. Trump is also meeting with Indiana Gov. Mike Pence Saturday at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, a source with knowledge of the meeting told CNN. Pence spokesman Marc Lotter told CNN on Friday that the meeting is ”consistent with the meetings that Mr. Trump is scheduling with many key party leaders.” A Trump adviser told CNN Pence is being considered for VP. Trump’s campaign chairman Paul Manafort has been pushing the idea of Pence as his running mate, according to another source.  A top Trump surrogate, Though Christie ran against Trump in the GOP primary, the two have been   friends and Christie quickly endorsed Trump and became a reliable presence at his events after dropping out of the race. The New Jersey governor has not only been one of Trump’s   surrogates, continually defending him against critics, but also one of his closest behind the scenes advisers, according to sources familiar with the relationship.  Road to 270: The 2016 Electoral Map, Trump, speaking with Concord, New   CNN affiliate   on Thursday demurred when he was asked whether Christie or former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown were on his running mate shortlist. ”Well, they’re both good guys. I don’t want to say shortlist but certainly they’re great people,” Trump said. ”Scott was a very early supporter and Chris was very early after he got out. And they’re certainly people I want involved.” For Christie, it has been quite a departure from what he initially sought out to do in 2016: win the GOP nomination. Blunt, with a big personality and a history of electoral success in a reliably blue state, Christie was once seen as a    or perhaps the      for the GOP nomination. Wounded by the fallout from revelations related to top aides deliberately closing lanes on George Washington Bridge as a form of political retribution, Christie still mounted a 2016 bid. In it, he wasn’t afraid to take a few shots at Trump, though he was always quick to point out that he and his wife, Mary Pat, were long time friends of the New York billionaire. ”Showtime is over, everybody,” Christie said while campaigning in New Hampshire in January. ”We are not electing an   . Showmanship is fun but it is not the kind of leadership that will truly change America.” GOP senator says endorsement could hinge on Trump’s running mate, For a brief period at the end of 2015, Christie appeared to have righted his campaign, only to see it come apart under withering attack ads in the lead up to the New Hampshire primary. A disappointing finish in the state led to the end of his run, and, a few weeks later, to the endorsement of Trump. It was a move surprised    and even angered    many of the players inside his presidential campaign, sources say. One said the move was ”such clear careerism    this wasn’t the man I signed up to work for.” Yet Christie has carved out an integral role inside Trump’s orbit. He’s operated, aides and advisers say, as a sort of   counselor of sorts to Trump in recent months    part strategist, part sounding board, part friend, and often (perhaps to the surprise of many in his home state of New Jersey) a calming voice of reason. ”It’s fascinating that I’m now the person that can speak my mind without offending anyone,” Christie told reporters earlier this month. When Trump was getting chastised by others in the GOP for his criticism of a federal judge over seeing a Trump University lawsuit, Christie said the billionaire was perfectly justified. ”In the end, there are always going to be conflicts regarding civil lawsuits. People are always going to express their opinions. Those are Donald’s opinions, and he has a right to express them,” he said. ”I can guarantee you that, you know, people who are going to vote today in (New Jersey) and people who are going to vote in November are not going to make their decision based upon this kerfuffle.” He added: ”I’ve known him for 14 years and Donald Trump is not a racist.” RELATED: Trump vs. the GOP (redux) Behind the scenes his role was more robust    he spent hours that day at Trump Tower, helping Trump craft a statement designed to put the issue behind the campaign, and sticking around to help him craft a subsequent speech. Christie has also been a top recruiter for Trump    both on the endorsement and fundraising side of the campaign. He’s been a regular caller to top GOP donors and activated his own network to try and bolster Trump’s moribund fundraising operation. The former head of the Republican Governor’s Association, he’s also regularly been in contact with GOP governors on the fence    or off it on the side of #NeverTrump    regarding Trump’s candidacy. The calls and meetings are described as cordial, even in cases where the answers are no. But one message has been clear: Trump is going to win    get on board now. It’s advice Christie himself took and could now benefit from more than anyone. He was Trump’s biggest endorsement at a crucial moment in the campaign and that has sparked talk about any number of possible positions inside a Trump administration. He has been the focus of vice presidential speculation for some time, leaving the possibility open when asked by reporters. That has led to no shortage of questions about Christie’s intentions with that endorsement, both among unaffiliated GOP officials, but also former aides. And it hasn’t always been a smooth process. There was the press conference where an entire Twittersphere jokingly wondered whether Christie had been taken hostage. (”I want everyone to know for those who were concerned: I wasn’t being held hostage,” Christie told reporters afterward.) There was the moment it appeared his wife    one of Christie’s top political advisers    appeared to roll her eyes at a Trump attack on Clinton during another press conference. Then Trump, during an event scheduled to help Christie retire his campaign debt, appeared to jab the New Jersey governor about his weight, saying: ”You’re not eating Oreos anymore, are you? No more Oreos for either of us, Chris. Don’t feel bad.” There’s also been Christie’s own political standing    by May, his approval numbers were down nearly 40 points from their high in November 2013. Christie for his part, has brushed all of those issues aside and maintained his endorsement was contingent on one thing: Trump represents the party’s best chance to defeat presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Whatever his reasons, this much is clear: Christie is all in. One adviser who spoke with CNN described Christie as a consigliere of sorts. Late night phone calls aren’t rare    Trump bouncing ideas and strategies off of Christie, complaints as well. But he also listens, this adviser added. That, the adviser said, may be the most important takeaway: Donald Trump, as much as Donald Trump can, listens to Chris Christie. An early Trump ally, Gingrich emerged early in the 2016 cycle as one of Trump’s most vociferous defenders, especially on cable television, where the former speaker has become one of the more colorful pundits. A longtime Washington fixture, Gingrich has deep ties to the nation’s leading lobbyists and has long fashioned himself as a political historian. Gingrich   his political touch during his 2012 presidential run, when he ran a spirited, at times   campaign against eventual nominee Mitt Romney. Gingrich won plaudits in the primary for excoriating the media, most prominently at a number of Republican debates. Yet despite his unmistakable position as a Washington insider, Gingrich was one of the earlier DC elites to repeatedly defend Trump. And his work as a surrogate has long earned him a place on handicappers’ list of those who might serve as Trump’s No. 2. But he said as recently as Sunday that he had not been formally asked to be considered. ”Nobody’s called me. Nobody has said, ’Would you like to be? ’’’ Gingrich said on ”Fox News Sunday.” ”Nobody has said anything.” And some thought his positioning in the Trump veepstakes was weakened by his criticism over Trump’s recent attacks on a federal judge with Mexican heritage who is overseeing a lawsuit against Trump University. Gingrich called Trump’s language ”completely unacceptable.” ”I thought it was inappropriate what he said,” Trump said of Gingrich at one point, adding that he was ”surprised” he would say so.

{"article": "It takes a few episodes of Better Things, the new FX comedy about an actor raising her three daughters in LA, to realize that there aren’t really any men in the series. Something similar dawns on you watching Atlanta, another new FX comedy about two cousins trying to make it in the southern entertainment Mecca’s   scene  —   except instead of men being absent it is white characters. Once you notice that these mainstays of traditional TV sitcoms aren’t here  —   as extinct as the dodo or Ryan Lochte’s endorsement deals  —   you also realize that you don’t much miss them. There are some men in Better Things, of course, but they are relegated to the minor roles usually reserved for women in comedy’s boys’ club: romantic interests and   shopkeepers and other such functionaries. To make the contrast even starker, the main character, Sam (Pamela Adlon) and her three daughters, Max (Mikey Madison) Frankie (Hannah Alligood) and Duke (Olivia Edward) all have dudes’ names.  The white people in Atlanta  —   and there are even fewer of them than there are men in Better Things  —   serve the same purpose that black actors do on other comedies. That is, they serve to make a point about race in America, before disappearing. For instance, a white colleague is seen to use the   around the main character, Earnest (Donald Glover) but not around his much more physically imposing cousin Paper Boi (Brian Tyree Henry) or their gonzo friend Darius (Keith Stanfield). The lack of such characters allows these new, fresh voices to be heard  —   and in both shows, they’re vibrant and engrossing. Better Things is a product of the partnership between Adlon and Louis CK  —   Adlon served as both a writer and   on Louie for several seasons and as CK’s wife on the   HBO comedy Lucky Louie. They created this show together (both serve as either writer or director of many of the episodes) and it shares lots in its DNA with CK’s signature creation. Not only is Better Things about an entertainer trying to raise a group of daughters it’s also an occasionally meandering, philosophical series of vignettes. Adlon’s character, Sam, is much more sympathetic and    than the Pamela we met on Louie. Just as CK is famous for his riff about how his kids are assholes, Sam has the same sort of antagonistic relationship with her children, scoffing at her oldest daughter when she asks her to score pot but then stealing the condom she finds under her daughter’s nightstand for an assignation with a married man.  While there are some   moments of feminism, like Sam’s speech at a women and girls’ empowerment seminar at her daughter’s school, Better Things is searching for a deeper meaning in how to navigate the world as a woman at all stages of life, both the good and the bad. Imagine Inside Amy Schumer were it half as didactic and twice as melancholy. While it sometimes can veer into familiar territories of sitcom schmaltz, Better Things offers essential fresh takes on motherhood, Hollywood and the vagaries of teenage life. Atlanta is as concerned with race as Better Things is about gender. In the show’s second episode, when Earnest finds himself in jail (not to be confused with Ernest Goes to Jail) he sees an inmate who is clearly mentally ill. When the cops say the inmate is imprisoned every week, Earnest wonders why they keep locking him up instead of getting him help. The cops treat him gently until he drinks toilet water and spits it at them then they viciously beat him. It’s comical, harrowing, audacious and sobering all at the same time.  That is what makes Atlanta an even better show than Better Things  —   in fact, one of the best new shows on television in quite some time. Glover is the star and creator of what feels a little bit like a   Girls. Earnest is barely employed, broke, and “technically homeless” as he pursues his dreams of being a rap manager while trying to raise his daughter. Like Lena Dunham, Glover is obviously playing a much less successful and ambitious version of himself.  While Atlanta’s observations are as keen as those in Better Things, the show is much more consistent in its laughs and tone. Atlanta also tackles a variety of subjects almost effortlessly, whether it’s homophobia and transphobia, the cycle of poverty, or the fraught relationship between law enforcement and the black community. Just as in real life, these issues can creep up anywhere and at any time, and Atlanta always has smart things to say about them.  Everything about this program seems new and vital, stylishly shot in hues that make the projects of Atlanta look like they were washed over with honeycomb and steeped in sunlight. The same is true of Better Things. This is a great step for FX, whose recent comedy duds, such as Baskets and SexDrugsRockRoll, deliver the same angsty   schtick that is pervasive in the world of     comedy. Though these new shows share little more than a network, they are also united in their desire to lend a voice to stories that are often ignored or marginalized. They’re both so darn good, audiences might start demanding fewer white guys in just about everything.", "prop": 0.04372521688201022},

{"article": "Michael Novak loved the Catholic Church and the United States passionately. And with his death at 83, both Church and nation have lost one of their most imaginative and accomplished sons: a groundbreaking theorist in philosophy, social ethics, religious studies, ethnic studies, and economics a brilliant teacher a winsome journalist and apologist a great defender of freedom, as both ambassador and polemicist a man of striking energy and creativity, some of whose books will be read for a very long time to come, and in multiple languages. In his last weeks, however, my thoughts turned, not to Michael’s scholarly and literary accomplishments, which others will celebrate, I’m sure. Rather, I thought of the man I knew for almost three and a half decades, and with whom I shared various adventures. Some of them, recollected here, may shed light on aspects of his character that might have escaped the attention of his admirers, as they certainly escaped the attention of his detractors. When I moved to Washington, D. C. the following year, I quickly came to see how Michael Novak and his good friend James Billington, then the director of the Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars, were making the nation’s capital an environment in which religiously informed moral reason was in play as in no other great world center. Jim Billington did this by quietly ensuring that the Wilson Center’s fellows included theologians and religious philosophers with a feel for applying their craft to the contingencies of political life, and then putting them in touch with the town’s movers and shakers. Michael did it by being himself in conversation with a wide range of Washingtonians, and by helping make the American Enterprise Institute a think tank where the software side of the democratic project was scrutinized for its weaknesses, and where possible improvements, informed by the biblical view of the human person, were imagined. There was nothing like that, then, in London or Paris and there isn’t today. But there is in Washington, and that is in no small part due to the work and the personal example of Michael Novak. Sweating it out in Naples. In the early 1990s, Michael, Richard John Neuhaus, and I all had books published in Italian editions by Mondadori, and the firm’s chief, the estimable Leonardo Mondadori (whose ardent Catholicism coincided with a social circle that included Bianca Jagger) insisted that we all come to Italy for presentations of our books in various forums. Even worse awaited us in Naples, where Leonardo Mondadori had arranged for a more academically focused session at which three Italian professors would discuss our books with us. Or so we thought. The event was held in a reconditioned monastery in the hills above the city, but despite the altitude the room was infernally hot and the Italian colleagues were infernally  . An hour and a half into the program, neither Michael, nor Richard, nor I had said a word, and Richard’s patience was wearing thin. When the Italian academics finally quieted down, Richard began by saying that, given the hour and the temperature, he would follow the dominical injunction to “Be merciful as your heavenly Father is merciful” (Luke 6. 36) and confine his remarks to five minutes I followed suit. But Michael, sensing that something more was expected of us, saved the evening by talking with great clarity and precision about the contributions John Paul II had made to Catholic social doctrine, explaining how these ought to be of interest to even the most   Italians. It was a bravura performance, and a lesson in patience and perseverance that I tried to follow in the years ahead. Take me out to the ballgame. It must have been in the mid 1980s when I took Michael to old Memorial Stadium in Baltimore for an Orioles game on a glorious spring evening. There was one feature of that old    horseshow that never failed to move me: As you came up one of the cement ramps to the upper deck, you caught a glimpse of the infield and a part of the outfield beneath the overhanging mezzanine section of the ballpark. That first sight of the greensward each season was always redolent of renewal, and as Michael and I shared that sense of vernal reawakening, the sharp crack of a   ball leaving an ash bat and heading for the bleachers rang through the stadium. “Greatest sound in sports,” I said. “Except for ‘swish,’” Michael immediately replied, thus revealing himself as a hoops man at heart. I’ve watched countless hours of games with a vast number of people over the past six decades, on site or on television: but I have never met anyone, anywhere, who got such intense pleasure out of sports as Michael Novak did. And not “intense” in the Bill Belichick sense of the   scowl, but “intense” as in sheer pleasure. Michael being Michael, that passion for our games overflowed into his writing, including the book he wanted to call “Balls” until an antsy editor talked him into something a little more, er, delicate: The Joy of Sports. But whatever the title, it was a book replete with insights that could come from only a passionate fan who had played the games and then thought seriously about them: baseball’s freedom from clock time as a signal of transcendence and its unique combination of individual achievement and team play as the embodiment of the “communitarian individual” football as “the liturgy of the bureaucratic state. ” The thought of never having the opportunity to watch another game with him, swapping stories and   managers and coaches, is not a happy one. But if heaven is the perfection of earthly goods, we’ll pick up the conversation in a place without instant replay, because the umps and refs always get it right. Teacher par excellence. In 1992, Michael started a summer seminar in Catholic social thought that I took over in 1999, and that will have its 26th session in Cracow in July. As various ailments began to wear away at his physical capacities, Michael stopped coming, Cracow not being a city very friendly to people with difficulties getting about. But several years ago he asked if he could participate again, if just for a few days, and I readily agreed. The economics section of the program, of which he was once the star, was being covered by others, so Michael spoke about his first love, philosophy, and the modern experience of nothingness. He was not a histrionic lecturer, but his soft and rather high voice, surprising when you first heard it coming from such a big man, had a mesmerizing quality, and my colleagues on the faculty began to understand why Michael was voted teacher of the year two of the three years he taught at Stanford. But it was less his lectures than his interactions with our students  —   young North Americans and central Europeans, all doing graduate studies  —   that I found most striking. They vied to push his wheelchair along the cobblestoned sidewalks of the city and jammed small restaurants to have lunch with him. He always had time for any number of questions. And in addition to what he brought to our work intellectually, he offered a model of patient counseling and courteous listening that our students will long remember. And it was only then, more than 30 years after we had first begun to collaborate, that I came to understand that Michael  —   author, intellectual, diplomat, counselor to presidents and friend of a pope  —   was, in terms of his professional life, first and foremost a teacher. What gave him the greatest satisfaction was seeing others get the light of understanding in their eyes and the joy of discovery on their faces. He would, I think, be willing to be judged by the world on that, his vocation as a teacher: and the judgment would, if just, be a very favorable one.,", "prop": 0.2566921727052584},
{"article": "Readers and staffers, primarily from Portland, Oregon, discuss and debate the various issues surrounding race, ethnicity, and class in the city. (The ongoing conversation was spurred by Alana Semuels’s article “The Racist History of Portland, the Whitest City in America. ”) If you have something to add, especially as a Portland native, please send us a note: hello@theatlantic. com. Alana’s recent piece on the racist history of Portland, Oregon, my hometown, cites a controversy that I remember: One incident captures how residents are failing to hear one another or have any sympathy for one another: In 2014, Trader Joe’s was in negotiations to open a new store in Albina. The Portland Development Commission, the city’s   agency, offered the company a steep discount on a patch of land to entice them to seal the deal. But the Portland African American Leadership Forum wrote a letter protesting the development, arguing that the Trader Joe’s was the latest attempt to profit from the displacement of African Americans in the city. By spending money incentivizing Trader Joe’s to locate in the area, the city was creating further gentrification without working to help locals stay in the neighborhood, the group argued. Trader Joe’s pulled out of the plan, and people in Portland and across the country scorned the black community for opposing the retailer. [Local historians] say that during that incident, critics of the African American community failed to take into account the history of Albina, which saw black families and businesses displaced again and again when whites wanted to move in.  A reader pushes back with a little more background: In this particular case that was a local black developer who had long been very active in the Albina neighborhood community who had gone through a quite lengthy negotiating process to develop that piece of land. [RIS note: The developer, Majestic Realty, was in fact based in California, but had hired a local   company, Colas Construction, as general contractor.] That piece of land, by the way, was a large, undeveloped brownfield that sits along a primary commercial corridor that had been vacant for over a decade, and it STILL sits there fenced off and growing weeds. There was no notable “neighborhood opposition” to the Trader Joe’s development UNTIL The Portland African American Leadership Forum [PAALF] a group virtually unheard of in the community until they challenged the TJ’s development. I wasn’t living in Portland when the Trader Joe’s deal fell through, but I remember the vacant lot. It’s located at Alberta Street and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, a busy thoroughfare that in the 2000s used to be lined with   restaurants, parking lots,   buildings, roadside bars —  more of a street to funnel people through than one to build community over, and one where my parents were skeptical of a teenage girl waiting for the bus. In 2013, according to an interactive map by The Oregonian, that intersection (represented by a green dot below) was in the heart of a food desert, with a significant number of   residents living more than half a mile from the nearest supermarket: That   data makes this particular case —  of a supermarket being shut out —  feel like a loss. Whatever the problems in the process of opening this lot for development, Trader Joe’s could have brought affordable groceries to the area. From The Oregonian: Grayson Dempsey, an   King resident who can see the vacant lot from her window, said she tried offering her support at neighborhood association meetings, but her voice was drowned out by the opposition. “I moved here when there were gunshots out the window,” Dempsey said. “I appreciate that (PAALF) is trying to talk about the origins of gentrification. That’s really essential, but they can’t stand up and say, ‘As residents of the King neighborhood, this is what we want.’ The residents of the King neighborhood want this to happen. ”   …      “We shouldn’t leave lots empty in the name of preserving the neighborhood,” she said. “Are we preserving the vacant lot history or do we want to bring it back to a vibrant neighborhood where people know their neighbors and feel safe walking around?” Fortunately, it’s looking now like the controversy will have a happy ending.  Last year, city officials announced that a different store, Natural Grocers, would be built on the vacant lot —  and that the development plan would also include building affordable housing on another   lot nearby, addressing activists’ concerns about local residents’ displacement. Meanwhile, St. Johns, the North Portland neighborhood where I grew up —  historically   and racially diverse, though seemingly segregated from street to street —  has been gentrifying rapidly too. The change is signified by the New Seasons, a regional, more affordable version of Whole Foods, that just opened up a few blocks from my parents’ house, replacing the   shuttered diner that had replaced a   McDonald’s. My mom, who’s been waiting for years for the stores nearby to carry more organic meat and produce, is thrilled. Yet she’s noticed the Fred Meyer supermarket around the corner has phased out its fish sauce and canned coconut milk, and drastically reduced its   selection. What used to be a full aisle of affordable Asian and Hispanic foods has been cut down to about six feet of shelf space. To compete with New Seasons, a clerk told her, Fred Meyer has changed its stock —  getting rid of brands targeted at local minority populations, while expanding its range of pricier,   products favored by young white professionals. “It’s like they’ve segregated us,” my mom says, half laughing, about the shrinking shelf space. Of course, it’s complicated: She hasn’t made a habit of buying her soy sauce at Fred Meyer for years. Instead, she drives out to East Portland or Beaverton to stock up at the Asian stores, where the soy sauce and patis —  Filipino fish sauce —  comes cheaper and in bulk. Still, Fred Meyer, where the cashiers know her face and remember her   son as a toddler, is where she goes every week for convenience, when she wants to stay close to home. It’s where she used to shop when she had young children and no time to drive out to the suburbs, and where she’d have to shop now if she didn’t have a car or an artist’s flexible work schedule. It’s a neighborhood store, and that’s the point: Beyond the question of soy sauce, what cutting back on Latino brands means in an area with a growing Latino population is that this supermarket is failing to reflect its neighborhood, which makes my mom —  and me —  worry that it may be failing to serve those neighbors. Where do you shop for food? Does your grocery store help you feel connected to your neighborhood? Do you prioritize convenience or cost? Foods that fit your culture or lifestyle? When a supermarket opens up in a food desert, how should it work to serve the existing community? We’d like to hear your thoughts at hello@theatlantic. com. Alana Semuels wrote a popular piece last month called “The Racist History of Portland, the Whitest City in America. ” Towards the end of it, she writes: Yet as the city became more progressive and “weird,” full of artists and techies and bikers, it did not have a conversation about its racist past. It still tends not to, even as gentrification and displacement continue in Albina and other neighborhoods. “If you were living here and you decided you wanted to have a conversation about race, you’d get the shock of your life,” Ed Washington, the longtime Portland resident, told me. “Because people in Oregon just don’t like to talk about it. ” Scores of Atlantic readers in Portland have been talking about Alana’s piece and emailing their views, so we’ve decided to convene a conversation about race in the city (via hello@theatlantic. com). To start things off, we’re focusing on Albina, the northeast area of Portland that historically housed the vast majority of the city’s African American residents. Albina now comprises the neighborhoods of Eliot, Boise, Humboldt, Irvington, King, Overlook, and Piedmont, plotted on this map: Here’s how Alana introduces Albina in her piece: As the city becomes more popular and   prices rise, it is Portland’s tiny African American population [6. 3 percent] that is being displaced to the   fringes of the city, leading to even less diversity in the city’s center. There are around 38, 000 African Americans in the city in Portland, according to Lisa K. Bates of Portland State University in recent years, 10, 000 of those 38, 000 have had to move from the center city to its fringes because of rising prices. The gentrification of the historically black neighborhood in central Portland, Albina, has led to conflicts between white Portlanders and   black residents over things like widening bicycle lanes and the construction of a new Trader Joe’s. Rosa Inocencio Smith, our new assistant editor for Notes (and writer of our Daily newsletter) will be posting a note soon about that Trader Joe’s controversy. Her hometown is Portland, so she will have a lot of great insight to share during our ongoing reader discussion. For my part, Portland has become an adopted hometown since my family moved there more than a decade ago, next to Albina, so I’m especially interested in this topic as well. But for a much closer firsthand perspective, here’s one of many readers who grew up in Albina: I lived in this neighborhood in the late ’80s. I still do. The first thing this article (and Kamau Bell’s CNN show [United Shades of America —  relevant clip here]) gets wrong is that this was a “black” neighborhood. Even when it was the center of black culture in Portland, it was still 40 percent white. Here’s a breakdown of that demographic over the decades: Back to our reader: The second thing is that blacks some how have a “historical claim” to Albina because they as a majority occupied it from roughly  . Hell, you could make the claim that neighboring Overlook is a “Polish” neighborhood if you want to go back far enough, and that the city should implement policies to promote Polish ownership, but nobody ever does. The third thing is over just how much safer (though in some respects less fun) this neighborhood is now. I too have had suspects pursued through my backyard, blocks cordoned off, gun fights in front of the house, I had to dive behind a car because of a   [reported examples here and here] been witness to and a victim of arson, and I can attest to this sad fact: More white people = less crime of all varieties, from littering to murder. As a homeowner here, amen to that. That “sad fact” seems very dubious. Gun crimes, for one, are dispersed throughout Portland, not just the Albina area: Residential burglary is similarly dispersed, while street robbery and   assaults are mostly concentrated downtown, across the river from Albina. Overall, according to an April 2015 news report that featured the crime statistics cited above, crime in Portland has “plummeted since the 1990s,” much like the rest of the country: Portland State Professor Kris Henning said many residents don’t realize that crime has declined considerably over the past 20 years. Henning said they devour so much crime news they think the city is more dangerous than it is. “Of the 13 crimes we looked at, the only one that increased significantly was bike theft,” [PSU student Kelsey] Baleilevuka said. Overall,   crimes in Portland have dropped 84%. Residential burglaries are down 61% motor vehicle thefts dropped 70% home robberies are down 76% and street robberies are down 70%.   …     Excluding homicides, crimes involving guns have moved from inner Northeast Portland toward Gresham. Another reader who lived in Albina makes a distinction between renters and homeowners in the neighborhood: Per the claim that 10, 000 African Americans were “forced out” of inner   I lived in the neighborhood starting in the late ’80s. Yes, it was   dangerous, and full of abandoned houses. Yes, I witnessed quite a few  . But many of my neighbors who were black and owned their homes were ready and willing, as prices increased throughout the ’90s, to sell out and move without being forced out. If you are a renter who can’t afford the rising rents, then you are forced to move. And this has happened to quite a few of my renting friends who have lived in the neighborhood for over 20 years, and yes, they are white. This next reader also attests to the crime in Albina in the ’80s, and the exodus of both black and white neighbors as development and higher prices arrived: It’s weird to read an Atlantic article about something I personally experienced. It’s a bit of a trip down memory lane. I’m white, and my parents moved to the Albina area in the late ’80s. They purchased and refurbished a 1920s bungalow as part of an urban renewal program. This made them the tip of the spear for gentrification, and the breakup of a historically black neighborhood. Like all people who kick off gentrification, they soon complained bitterly about the later newcomers who shoved property prices into the stratosphere. We moved from the area before I hit middle school, but I can confirm many of the points in the article. Rentals proliferated through the neighborhood. The area was still rough when we lived there. Police presence was constant, and it wasn’t until we moved that I realized constant police presence isn’t a thing in all neighborhoods. Once in a blue moon there were gunshots at night. My parents gave me lectures about not picking up trash and avoiding the used needles that littered public spaces. I vividly remember an incident when the police sealed off our entire block and ended up pursuing a fleeing man directly through our backyard. But there was definitely a community there. It was a mix of black and   white people who seemed to get along in a    sense. I often wonder what became of our old neighbors. Several adjacent properties were owned by black people who seemed to be just holding steady. With property prices in that area increasing about 10x since then, I wonder if they could even afford the taxes for their places if they stayed. Honestly, though, I don’t know if the breakup of the Albina black enclaves in Portland could have been prevented in any way. Portland in general is increasingly hostile to native populations from a financial standpoint. It’s overrun with wealthy tech money that dwarfs what used to be there. I recently visited part of my old neighborhood, and it’s a romping ground for Audis, Teslas, and people who buy $200 bottles of wine for dinner. Myself and my extended family were long ago shoved out into the suburbs. Race aside, nobody with a “normal” job can afford to buy property in many locations mentioned in the article. I don’t know exactly what people think could have been done to “preserve” the neighborhood, other than making some sort of bizarre   law that only allowed people of a certain race to live there. The real problem in Portland for   people of all colors is a lack of affordable housing. And the city’s response to that has been typically bureaucratic and inept. Here’s one more reader emphasizing class: I lived in Portland in the 1970s and have a child who lives there now. Urban renewal was not motivated by race it was motivated by money. If you lived in a cute or interesting neighborhood and someone with more money came along and wanted to live there too, they got to stay and you had to go. I had to leave Portland because I did not have the money or the job to stay. I had lived there for four years. The first year I lived within six blocks of the medical school, but by my last year of living in “Portland,” I lived in Tigard. I could have either lived in Tigard or I could have lived in Gresham. I was not pushed out of the downtown area because of my race I was pushed out because of money. If you have also lived in Albina and want to provide any contrasting views and experiences, please drop us a note. *** One question that arises from Alana’s article: Does gentrification ever increase opportunity for poor residents? Definitely, according to Lance Freeman, the director of the Urban Planning program at Columbia. In an email he sent me last summer for a piece on gentrification, Freeman described some of the upsides: Gentrification brings new amenities and services that benefit not only the newcomers but long term residents too.   supermarkets that carry fresh produce, restaurants where residents could dine in, and   parks are often lacking in poor neighborhoods prior to gentrification. For   residents who are able to stay, either due to housing subsidies, owning their home, or their own earning capacity improving, these changes are often appreciated. And most residents are able to stay, at least according to a 2004 study that Freeman conducted with economist Frank Braconi they found that   African Americans in New York City were more likely to remain in gentrifying neighborhoods than stagnant ones. They noted similar findings in Boston. And here’s how my colleague Yoni Appelbaum, in a post by   Coates, summarized another study, from the University of  : “In plain English, they’re arguing that gentrification isn’t forcing people out it’s bringing in yuppies and hipsters, and hanging on to   minority households that would otherwise have decamped for the suburbs. ” In the case of Portland, whose black residents were historically confined to one area, wouldn’t the displacement of many Albina renters out to “The Numbers” —  the city’s   outer neighborhoods, which are historically white —  have, at minimum, a silver lining of more racial integration? And   African Americans who own their homes in Albina are likely to remain, thus blending with the   newcomers of all backgrounds. (More than 26 percent of Portland residents are not classified “white” or “black. ”) That sort of gentrification —  black neighborhoods becoming more white and white neighborhoods becoming more black, with at least more investment in Albina, if not The Numbers —  seems like the least bad outcome. The risk, in my mind, is if the movement of people and money occurs too quickly, without reasonable measures in place to mitigate mass displacement (e. g. rent control,   housing, Section 8 vouchers). A 2015 report by Governing magazine determined that Portland is, in fact, the   city in the U. S. —  something that should give everyone pause. Do you have any strong views about gentrification, especially as it relates to Portland? Let us know. *** For continued reading on Albina, a reader recommends a history published in 1993 by the Portland Bureau of Planning: As someone who lived in Portland for years, and now lives elsewhere in Oregon, I was glad to read the article by Alana Semuels. One book I would recommend to anyone who wants to read about this history at greater length would be Portland’s Albina Community, available online from Multnomah County.  Despite the provenance, it’s unvarnished. It dates from the ’90s, though, before gentrification, when Albina was still   black and had a different set of problems. Another reader points to a much older chapter in Portland’s history: I’ve been an Oregonian my whole life, and can attest to Semuels’s article. I’ve been doing some work on local history, and something that may be worth bringing up is the foundation of the Portland Police, largely by James H. Lappeus. Lappeus was a former soldier that, after the   War, helped form other veterans in 1849 into the Hounds. To quote a 1920 article by Rockwell Hunt, “In short, the Hounds were a band of desperadoes, or public robbers, who committed repeated aggressions and offenses upon the people of San Francisco under the flimsy pretense of opposition to foreigners, given colors by General Persifer Smith’s declared intention of driving off all foreigners. The gang paralyzed the town with terror. ” Hunt gives too much credit to the Committee of Vigilance that expelled the Hounds, but several of the Hounds —  Lappeus included —  went to Portland. Lappeus, as noted, started the Portland Police. The distant infrastructure in a relatively unpopulated part of the nation ended up continuing to be a    infrastructure with more than a little splash of white criminal activity (see [crime boss] Jim Elkins, for instance). The perception that the police, and general infrastructure, in Portland is racist is a historic fact. The only way to really change it is to recognize and address it. There has been movement to that direction, but it has —  and will be —  slow going.         For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.

{"article": "  Americans who voted for Donald J. Trump continue to approve of him as president, even though he supported a health care bill that would disproportionately hurt them. Highly educated professionals tend to lean Democratic, even though Republican tax policies would probably leave more money in their pockets. Why do people vote against their economic interests? The answer, experts say, is partisanship. Party affiliation has become an   identity that outweighs the details of specific policies. “Partisan identification is bigger than anything the party does,” said Frances Lee, a professor at the University of Maryland who wrote a book on partisan polarization. Rather, it stems from something much more fundamental: people’s idea of who they are. For American voters, party affiliation is a way to express a bundle of identities. “It more or less boils down to how you see the conflicts in American society, and which groups you see as representing you,” Ms. Lee said. “That often means race, and religion, and ethnicity  —   those are the social groups that underlie party identification. ” That process is not necessarily conscious. “There’s sort of an embarrassment about being a partisan,” Ms. Lee said. “It’s seen as admitting to a bias. ” That often leads people to say that they are independent, she said, but in fact most voters consistently lean toward one of the parties. As partisanship grows, switching parties has become rare for voters. So has   in which voters support different parties in presidential and   races. But when people do switch, it is often because they feel that the other party has become a better representative of the groups that they identify with. Preliminary data suggests that is what happened with the Democratic voters who voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, said Lilliana Mason, a professor at the University of Maryland who studies partisanship. “Older voters who scored high on racial resentment were much more likely to switch from Obama to Trump,” Ms. Mason said. She believes that he successfully made a pitch to what she calls “white male identity politics,” convincing older,   white voters that he would represent their interests. Economic status, it turns out, is not so important in partisanship. “Class in American politics, rich vs. poor, is just not a very good predictor of party identification,” Ms. Lee said. For both rich and poor Americans, other identities take precedence. “There are plenty of rich Democrats,” Ms. Lee pointed out. “There are plenty of Republican politicians who represent poor districts. ” That’s not to say that the parties don’t have major differences on economic matters. But, experts say, those differences matter more to elites than to    voters. That is why, for instance, Mr. Trump was able to win the G. O. P. nomination even though he broke with Republican ideology on economic matters like trade protectionism. His arguments played to white   voter identity, and that turned out to be a successful strategy even though it alienated many of the party’s leaders. But how voters choose their party is only one element of the story. The overlapping identities that underlie partisanship are also driving a form of polarization so strong that it is now essentially impossible for politicians, or the public, to avoid its influence. In 2009, when Ms. Mason was still a graduate student, she had a “eureka” moment about American politics. “I stumbled across this social psychology article from 2002 that talked about what happens when multiple identities line up together,” she said in an interview. “There was all this social psychology literature about how it increases bias. ” The same, she realized, was true of partisan identity. Everyone has multiple identities: racial, religious, professional, ideological and more. But while those multiple identities might once have pushed people in different partisan directions  —   think of the conservative Democrats of old in the South or all the liberal Republicans in the Northeast  —   today it’s more common to line up behind one party. A white conservative who lives in a rural area and is an evangelical Christian is likely to feel that the Republican Party is the best representative of all of those separate identities, for instance. An   liberal who lives in a city and works in a professional job is likely to feel the same way about the Democratic Party. Can this explain why American politics have become so polarized over the last several decades? Starting in 1980, the National Election Study, a   survey that tracks Americans’ political preferences, showed that Republicans and Democrats were growing apart: Each reported increasingly negative opinions of the opposing party. And other data showed that polarization was seeping into nonpolitical arenas, making Republicans and Democrats less likely to marry or be friends. Ms. Mason decided to make that the focus of her doctoral thesis, and found much to support her hypothesis: Americans’ overlapping political identities were driving extreme polarization. When multiple identities line up together, all pushing people toward the same party, partisan identity becomes a kind of umbrella for many different characteristics that people feel are important to them. That magnifies people’s attachment to their team. And that, in turn, raises the stakes of conflict with the opposing “team,” Ms. Mason found. In every electoral contest or partisan disagreement, she explained, people now feel that they are fighting for many elements of who they are: their racial identity, professional identity, religious identity, even geographical identity. “The way I think of it is, imagine that the World Series also affected the N. C. A. A. and the Super Bowl and every other team you care about,” she said. “So as our identities line up with party identity, politics becomes more and more consequential. ” That may have been the key to Mr. Trump’s success in the 2016 election, she believes. “With Trump, if you can point to one brilliant thing he did, it’s that he as a politician, kind of for the first time, said ‘we’re losers.’ ” Social psychology research has shown that the best way to get people to defend their identity is to threaten it. By saying “we don’t win anymore  —   we’re losers  —   and I’m going to make us win again,” Ms. Mason said, Mr. Trump’s pitch to voters both created the sense of threat and promised a defense: a winning political strategy for the age of identity politics. The result of those overlapping, powerful identities is that Americans have become more willing to defend their party against any perceived threat, and to demand that their politicians take uncompromisingly partisan stands. But while those demands can affect policy, they are rooted in emotional attachments, not policy goals. “When we talk about being a sports fan, there’s no policy content related to that,” Ms. Mason said. “It’s just this sense of connection. And that’s powerful! It makes people cry. It makes people riot. There doesn’t really have to be any policy content for people to get riled up, and to be extremely committed. ” Ms. Mason, along with Leonie Huddy, a professor at Stony Brook University, and Lene Aaroe of Aarhus University in Denmark, conducted an experiment to test the importance of policy. They found that people responded much more strongly to threats or support to their party than to particular issues. They became angry at perceived threats to their party, and enthusiastic about its perceived successes. Their responses to policy gains and losses, by contrast, were much more muted. That helps explain why Mr. Trump’s support among Republican voters remains quite high, even though the first few months of his presidency have been plagued by scandals and political setbacks, and even though his overall national approval ratings are now very low. He has been careful to recast every potential scandal and policy struggle as a battle against the Democrats and other outside groups. Mr. Trump has insisted, for instance, that the F. B. I. investigation into his campaign staffers’ contacts with Russia is meaningless “fake news,” and that the real issue is whether President Obama wiretapped him before the election. (There is no evidence thus far that any such wiretapping took place.) And when the Republican health care bill failed despite Mr. Trump’s support, he at first blamed Democrats. Republican voters may not be happy with everything the president does  —   many, for instance, have told reporters that they would prefer him to tweet less often, and others worry about how his health care plans will affect their families  —   but he is still the captain of their “team. ” Abandoning him would mean betraying tribal allegiance, and all of the identities that underlie it.", "prop": 0.4501085048914494},

But in the meantime he’s borrowed from the banks, he’s personally guaranteed, and he didn’t put them on his personal financial disclosure form, which is a tremendous sin,” Trump said, inaccurately describing the forms the loans were omitted from. “I mean, that’s a horrible thing he did. And he didn’t disclose all of this information. ” According to the The New York Times, which first reported the omission of the loans last week, Cruz did report the loans in personal financial disclosures filed with the Senate, but did not report them as a source of income for his Senate campaign. Cruz has called the failure to disclose the loans a “technical and inadvertent filing error. ” In the interview on The Howie Carr Show, Trump reiterated his case that Cruz, who was born in Canada, should seek to clarify that he is eligible for the presidency, saying “He’s got to go to court to take out the doubt, Howie. ” And at various points in the conversation the real estate magnate set his sights on Jeb Bush, panning him for his campaign expenditures, calling him a “child,” and saying “he’s ashamed to use the last name Bush. ” “He should give it to the Wounded Warriors and stop wasting his money,” Trump said. “And much of it was spent on negative ads on me and then he wonders why I treat him badly. But he’s a child. He’s a child. And this is the problem. We can’t have people like this running our country. China would walk all over Jeb Bush. ISIS would walk all over Jeb Bush. ” Trump added later, “He’s like a child, he’s like a child. And he ought to try using his last name. He’s not even proud of his last name. He says Jeb. And he oughta use his last name. ” Trump also appeared to defend South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, who criticized the former reality TV star in her rebuttal to President Obama’s State of the Union address, calling on Americans to “resist the siren call of the angriest voices,” a comment that led Trump supporters and Trump himself to hit back at her, saying she is “weak” on immigration. But on Wednesday, Trump, who called himself an “angry person” who is “very happy in my life, but I’m very angry about the way our country is being run,” said Haley said she understood his anger. “She understood it and she actually, you know, came out and said, I fully understand it,” Trump said. “I’ve been a supporter of hers and she understood that I’m angry, but it’s not just me.

Trump’s idea is to institute a “   ” rule  —   that for every new regulation, two must be removed. Britain instituted a similar protocol in 2010 to cull unnecessary regulation and recently expanded it to “one in, three out. ” This is part of a broader British effort to control regulatory creep, and it has achieved modest success. Imposing similar discipline on new U. S. regulations is long overdue. For the past 50 years, Washington’s approach has been like the Roach Motel  —   regulations check in, but they never check out. But incremental reform is not enough.    reformers have failed because they assume the problem is a matter of degree  —   that there are just too many rules. Liberals stride into the   jungle with pruning shears, and find themselves entangled in the internal logic of the rules. Conservatives get cheers for demanding deregulation, but when push comes to shove, voters don’t want to drink polluted water, eat spoiled food or entrust loved ones to the unsupervised care of strangers in   centers and nursing homes. That’s why the regulatory state grew, not shrank, in the 20 years of Reagan and two Bush presidencies.  What reformers have missed is that regulatory failure is not merely a matter of too much regulation but is caused by a flawed philosophy on how to regulate. Both sides assume that human responsibility should be replaced by what is called “clear law. ” By striving to prescribe every possible good choice, and proscribe every possible evil, U. S. regulation became an obsessive exercise in micromanagement. That’s why rulebooks are often 1, 000 pages, while the Constitution is 15. The evil to be exorcised by all these legal dictates is human authority. Only by lashing each other tightly with detailed law can liberal and conservative politicians be sure that the other side won’t do something bad. But ordinary citizens in our free society are also lashed to these mindless dictates  —   complying with rules that often make no difference, filling out forms no one reads and stymied by bureaucrats whose response to every idiocy is always “The rule made me do it. ” In the name of better freedom, detailed regulations have made everyone powerless. The solution  —   the only solution  —   is to retool regulation to focus on results, not inputs. Find any good school, any good agency, and you will find people who take responsibility for getting the job done. Experts at the Federal Aviation Administration certify planes as “airworthy” based on their expert judgment, not compliance with detailed specs on, say, how many rivets per square foot. Teachers at good schools typically say that the principal encourages them to do what they think is best and not worry about complying with many forms and metrics. The activating mechanism for every public choice must be human responsibility. What’s good is what works. Yes, it’s a good idea to review environmental impacts, but it’s idiotic to spend a decade creating   tomes that double the cost of projects and cause environmental harm by prolonging polluting bottlenecks.  The opportunity here is to move from paralysis to practicality. Focusing on results, with clear lines of authority and accountability, is a   strategy: Regulation is more effective, and less costly, when regulators and citizens are not preoccupied with compliance. Australia replaced dense nursing home regulation with 31 general principles  —   for example, to provide “a   setting. ” Within a short period, nursing homes across Australia markedly improved because, studies showed, the caregivers felt free to focus on what residents needed instead of trudging through the day with their noses in a rulebook.  Regulation by results would radically simplify law  —   in some areas, more like “   . ” Hundreds of federal safety specifications for factory equipment could be encompassed within one general principle: “Tools and equipment shall be reasonably suited for the use intended, in accordance with industry standards. ” Is there room for disagreement? Yes, but only at the margins. Instead of wasting regulatory resources on foot faults that don’t matter, the safety agency could redeploy its resources to finding workplaces that are actually unsafe. Specificity would still be needed for, say, pollution discharge limits, but the litmus test should be whatever achieves the desired results. Rebuilding the federal behemoth is an ambitious goal, fraught with perceived peril as well as opportunity. But do we have a choice? No one serious defends the inefficiencies in the current system. Americans are tired of being pushed around by headless bureaucracy.   by the past six presidents have all failed. The upside here is transformational. Virtually every federal program is broken, with the only open question how much. Should   compliance costs drive small banks into the arms of larger banks? Should safety laws prohibit children from normal play activities? All these stupidities can be cured, but only if people with responsibility are given the freedom to use common sense. Giving permits for infrastructure in two years, not 10, would add 1. 5 million jobs and create a greener footprint.  The downside is low. Rigid bureaucracy prevents officials and citizens alike from adapting to rapid changes in global forces. Regulation by results doesn’t guarantee success, but it gives us the freedom to try.

{"article": "With the media frantically hiding the content of Donald Trump’s terrorism speech from last week, he should respond to every question with the central point of that speech: How does this kind of immigration make our country better? How does it make the country safer? [Media: Show us your tax returns!  Trump: Show me how our immigration policies are good for the people who already live here. Media: Tell us why you fired Corey Lewandowski! Trump: Tell me how our immigration policies are making the country safer for the people who already live here. Media: How are you going to match Hillary’s corporate fundraising? Trump: How are our immigration policies helping the people who already live here? Sooner or later people will say, “That’s a good question  —   why is this necessary?” When the Third World immigrants admitted under Sen. Teddy Kennedy’s 1965 Immigration Act  —   as well as their children  —   commit mass murder, the government and media tell us it’s a gun problem. Or it’s “our” culture. Or it’s “homophobia. ” Or we have to keep admitting millions of Muslims because otherwise the ones already here will REALLY hate us. Isn’t that extortion? We’ve already admitted millions of Muslim immigrants, but if we don’t take in millions more, the ones we’ve admitted will go on killing sprees? How did we get in the position where we’re screwed if we’re not in the good graces of the Muslim community? Maybe we should stop doing that. As any competent health professional will tell you, prevention is always better than a cure. No one says, Go ahead and have sex with that syphilitic whore  —   we’ve got a cure! You don’t need to worry about a leaky roof  —   we’ve got mops! They know that’s not a good argument, which is why the media refuse to tell you what Trump actually said in his terrorism speech. Like defendants with a losing case being forced to cough up bits of discovery, it took the FBI a week to release a redacted transcript of the Orlando shooter’s 911 call pledging allegiance to ISIS. Even then, the first version came from George Orwell’s Ministry of Truth: “I pledge allegiance to (omitted) may God protect him (in Arabic) on behalf of (omitted). ” That was too much even for Speaker Paul “That’s Not Who We Are” Ryan, prompting the FBI to produce the full version of at least one of Omar’s calls. (It turns out, he wasn’t pledging allegiance to Wayne LaPierre or Phyllis Schlafly.) To hide the epidemic of immigrant mass murders, all the lists have to include massacres from a time when there weren’t many immigrants here  —   before Kennedy’s Immigration Act had fully kicked in and overwhelmed our country with the Third World. Fox News ran a chart compiled by Mother Jones magazine that includes mass shootings from the 1980s. Why not the 1960s? Why not include Bonnie and Clyde? Could we look at mass murders from the last decade? Those include: 2016: Orlando, Florida,   Afghan immigrant Omar Mateen  —   49 dead, 2015: San Bernardino, California,   and   Pakistani immigrants Tashfeen Malik and Syed Farook  —   14 dead, 2015: Chattanooga, Tennessee, Kuwaiti immigrant Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez  —   5 dead, 2014: Isla Vista, California,   immigrant from England, Elliot Rodger  —   6 dead, 2013: The Boston Marathon, Chechen immigrants Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev  —   4 dead, 2009: Fort Hood, Texas, Palestinian   immigrant Nidal Hasan  —   13 dead, 2009: Binghamton, New York, Vietnamese immigrant Jiverly Wong  —   13 dead, 2007: Virginia Tech, South Korean immigrant   Cho  —   32 dead. In the same time period, about a   mass murders were committed by American white men in their own country, where  —   despite Teddy Kennedy’s best efforts  —   they far outnumber Vietnamese, Pakistanis and Afghans. All the American shooters were visible nut cases, who never should have been let out of a  . Their psychotic episodes wouldn’t even count as mass shootings if committed by immigrants. Pakistani Naveed Haq’s 2006 mass shooting at the Seattle Jewish Federation, for example, isn’t generally included on lists of terrorist attacks because, according to his parents, he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was on lithium. Why do we need this? How are our current immigration policies helping the people who already live here? How are they making our country better, stronger, safer? The operation to remake our country began with lies and has been sustained with lies ever since. Teddy Kennedy swore up and down that his 1965 Immigration Act would preserve America’s traditional “ethnic mix” and would not “inundate” our country with people from “deprived nations. ” In fact, his law brought in the poorest of the poor, from the most dysfunctional cultures in the world, and effected the most dramatic demographic transformation of any nation in all of human history.

About a year after her body was found, police arrested Johnson, the  ’s  .  Johnson was convicted of second degree murder in January 2013. But his attorneys successfully argued that he should have a new trial because the prosecution withheld evidence about a witness who linked Johnson to the killing, according to the judge’s order that summarized the case. Last month, the second trial ended in a mistrial because the jury was allowed to hear information in recordings that should have been redacted, the court order stated.  Defense lawyers filed a motion for acquittal. The judge’s order said there was plenty of circumstantial evidence against Johnson, including that he was the last person known to see Barnes and that a witness watched him sweating as he carried an object in a tote down the apartment stairs on the day she disappeared.  However, the judge wrote, ”there was insufficient evidence when taken as a whole” to convict Johnson on a charge of   murder.

{"article": " With Bernie Sanders now leading in both Iowa and New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton’s been trying to blunt his economic populist appeal by showing that she, too, is serious about taxing rich people. First she proposed a new 4 percent surcharge on all income above $5 million (including capital gains and investment income) and now she’s proposing a hike in the estate tax. Clinton would increase the maximum rate to 45 percent from the current maximum of 40, and decrease the lifetime exemption from estate and gift taxes to $3. 5 million from $5. 45 million.    But it’s important to put this proposal in context. Not only does the 45 percent figure pale in comparison to Sanders’s proposed 65 percent top rate, but a 45 percent top rate is actually quite low by historical standards. The current 40 percent rate, and the 35 percent rate that preceded it, are the lowest since 1932. The rate peaked at 77 percent, and stayed there from 1940 to 1976. When President Clinton left office, it was 55 percent. It was only after the Bush tax cuts ratcheted the tax back, ultimately eliminating them in 2010, that President Obama and   Minority Leader Mitch McConnell reached a deal to retroactively bring the tax back at 35 percent for that year. The 2012 tax deal raised the rate again to 40 percent, where it’s been ever since:              The $3. 5 million exemption is also very high by historical standards:              In fairness, Sanders’s plan is more tepid than it initially appears. The 65 percent rate only applies to estates worth $1 billion or more. His exemption would also be $3. 5 million for individuals, just like Clinton’s. They’d even share the 45 percent rate for estates between $3. 5 million and $10 million; Sanders adds a 50 percent bracket for estates between $10 million and $50 million, and then a 55 percent bracket for estates larger than that, plus a 10 percent surtax for billionaires (hence the 65 percent figure). It’s a significantly bigger tax hike than Clinton’s, but it still doesn’t get the estate tax back up to its 1999 or 2000 levels.    Clinton and Sanders are also both declining to pursue more fundamental reforms to the   ”death tax.” A number of tax analysts, notably NYU Law’s Lily Batchelder, have proposed moving to an inheritance tax, where the living beneficiaries of an estate, rather than the deceased person’s estate itself, would include inheritance money in their taxable income and perhaps pay an additional surtax on it. This ensures that the most affluent inheritors pay the most, and giving each beneficiary a lifetime exclusion of $1 million to $2 million would encourage estates to distribute to more people, breaking themselves up into smaller pieces and more effectively combating entrenched dynamic wealth than the current tax. Inheritance taxation also has a political benefit, in that it would mean the government is not technically taxing dead people. ", "prop": 0.4329310094136267},
{"article": "In the last installment, we examined some positive historical precedents for a new president’s foreign policy.  In this installment, we will consider positive precedents for a new president’s domestic policy. [Next in a series,    1.  The Democrats’ Struggle to Remember Their Roots  For the Forgotten Man, and the Forgotten Woman, it’s nice to be remembered.  During the campaign, Donald Trump revived the phrase, “Forgotten Man,” which echoes back to the Depression years of the 1930s. Specifically, it harkens to Franklin D. Roosevelt, the great   champion of   Americans. As FDR said during the 1932 presidential campaign, while challenging incumbent Herbert Hoover —  who had presided over an   increase in unemployment during his single miserable term —  the crisis of the age was akin to 1917, when the US was forced to enter World War One: These unhappy times call for the building of plans that rest upon the forgotten, the unorganized but indispensable units of economic power for plans like those of 1917 that build from the bottom up and not from the top down, that put their faith once more in the forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid.  [emphasis added] The American people appreciated FDR’s sense of urgency, which stood in stark contrast with Hoover’s        .  So in November 1932, FDR won a massive victory, carrying 42 of 48 states.  Thus we can see: The Forgotten People didn’t like being forgotten, and they were grateful to the candidate who cared about them.  Eight decades later, we were reminded of this same point: During the campaign, Donald Trump had plenty to say about the economy, and his message most hit home in the forgotten areas of the country.  For example, on October 21, in   Johnstown, PA, Trump said: Your government betrayed you, and I’m going to make it right.  Your jobs will come back under a Trump administration.  Your steel will come back. We’re putting your miners back to work.  In addition, Trump was respectful to, and attentive of, the industrial heritage of the region:  The iron and steel forged in your mills formed the backbone of our nation.  . . . This was the town that people flocked to from around the world to make their American Dreams come true. And so on Election Night, the victorious Trump, having Pennsylvania and other afflicted states, emphatically revived the Rooseveltian trope of yore, proclaiming, “The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. ” Remember my forgotten manYou put a rifle in his handYou sent him far awayYou shouted: “ ! ”But look at him today, Yes, it’s sad that the folks who have played by the rules, paid their taxes, and fought in the wars were forgotten —  as the forces of globalism, mostly cheered by the elites of both parties —  took their terrible toll. Then came Trump.   As we all know, he talked a different language, with a different set of issues, than the other 16 Republicans in the presidential race —  and he was richly rewarded.  And then came Trump vs. Clinton.    Hillary, Obama’s anointed successor, ran a campaign that could only be described as snobbish, curiously hostile to “deplorable” Middle America.  In the tart words of liberal novelist Mark Lilla, she thought she could win by ignoring America as a whole, and instead   favored blocs:  She tended on the campaign trail to lose that large vision and slip into the rhetoric of diversity, calling out explicitly to   Latino, LGBT and women voters at every stop. This was a strategic mistake.  If you are going to mention groups in America, you had better mention all of them.  If you don’t, those left out will notice and feel excluded.  Which, as the data show, was exactly what happened with the white working class and those with strong religious convictions.  Fully   of white voters without college degrees voted for Donald Trump, as did over 80 percent of white evangelicals. Indeed, the whole 2016 election can be seen as a battle between   insiders and   outsiders.  In the   words of Peggy Noonan, the voting was reflective of the distinction between the “protected” and the “unprotected”:  The unprotected people of America, who have to live with Washington’s policies, rebelled against the protected, who make and defend those policies and who care little if at all about the unprotected.  That broke bonds of loyalty and allegiance.  Tuesday was in effect an uprising of the unprotected.  It was part of the   against detached elites that is sweeping the West and was seen most recently in the Brexit vote. Hence the November 18 headline in Politico: “House Democrats lament     Some fear that the party’s move toward urban and suburban voters will eventually shut Democrats out of former white   strongholds. ”  In the words of Rep. Collin Peterson ( .) an increasingly lonely rural Democrat, “We’ve become an urban party. ” Indeed, for Democrats, a grimmer, and more realistic, mood seems to be settling in about not only geography, but also, ideology.  Thus this November 20 headline, also in Politico: “How the Left Created Trump: Nov. 8 represented an explosion of anger on the right at years of smugness and disdain by liberals. ”  In the words of writer Rob Hoffman:  As a bemused aside: Wasn’t it just yesterday that the Democrats, and their handmaidens in the MSM, were telling Republicans that they were doomed if they didn’t embrace multiculturalism and “comprehensive immigration reform”?  Yet as always, as James Carville famously said, “It’s the economy, stupid. ”  And so where were the Democrats on that issue?  Here’s where they were this year: busy dreaming up schemes to decrease growth. ", "prop": 0.8699525895947352},

{"article": " The Arab world’s biggest powers cut ties with Qatar on Monday, accusing it of support for Islamist militants and Iran, and reopening a festering wound two weeks after U. S. President Donald Trump’s demand for Muslim states to fight terrorism. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain severed diplomatic relations with Qatar in a coordinated move. Yemen, Libya’s   government and the Maldives joined later. Transport links shut down, triggering supply shortages. Qatar, a small peninsular nation of 2. 5 million people that has a large U. S. military base, denounced the action as predicated on lies about it supporting militants. It has often been accused of being a funding source for Islamists, as has Saudi Arabia. Iran, long at odds with Saudi Arabia and a    target of the move, blamed Trump’s visit last month to Riyadh and called for the sides to overcome their differences. ”What is happening is the preliminary result of the sword dance,” tweeted Hamid Aboutalebi, deputy chief of staff to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, referring to Trump’s joining in a traditional dance with the Saudi king at the meeting. Closing all transport links with Qatar, the three Gulf states gave Qatari visitors and residents two weeks to leave, and Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt banned Qatari planes from  landing and forbade them from crossing their air space. Qatar’s stock market index sank 7. 3 percent, with some of the market’s top blue chips hardest hit, and some Egyptian banks said they were suspending dealing with Qatari banks. The UAE and Saudi Arabia stopped exports of white sugar to Qatar, a potential hit to consumers during the holy month of Ramadan, when demand is high. Some residents in Qatar began stockpiling food and supplies, an expatriate said. ”People have stormed into the supermarket hoarding food, especially imported ones. . .. It’s chaos   I’ve never seen anything like this before,” said Eva Tobaji, an expatriate resident in Doha, told Reuters after returning from shopping. Supply difficulties quickly developed. Two Middle East trade sources spoke of thousands of trucks carrying food stuck at the Saudi border, unable make the sole overland frontier crossing into Qatar. About 80 percent of Qatar’s food requirements are sourced via bigger Gulf Arab neighbors. Trade sources pointed to the likelihood of shortages growing in Qatar until the crisis eased.  Along with Egypt, however, the UAE and Saudi Arabia could be vulnerable to retaliation, being highly dependent on Qatar for liquefied natural gas. ’WORRISOME’ The hawkish tone on Tehran and on terrorism that Trump brought in his visit to Muslim leaders in Riyadh is seen as having laid the groundwork for the diplomatic crisis. ”You have a shift in the balance of power in the Gulf now because of the new presidency: Trump is strongly opposed to political Islam and Iran,” said   Rickli, head of global risk and resilience at the Geneva Centre for Security Policy. ”He is totally aligned with Abu Dhabi and Riyadh, who also want no compromise with either Iran or the political Islam promoted by the Muslim Brotherhood.” The United States called for a quick resolution of the dispute, and does not want to see a ”permanent rift,” a senior U. S. administration official said. ”There’s an acknowledgement that a lot of Qatari behavior is quite worrisome not just to our Gulf neighbors but to the U. S.,” the official said. ”We want to bring them in the right direction.” A State Department official said all U. S. partnerships with Gulf nations were vital and called on all parties to quickly resolve their differences. The U. S. military said it had seen no impact to its   operations, intended mainly as a bulwark against Iran, and added it was grateful for Qatar’s   support of a U. S. presence and commitment to regional security. The diplomatic   threatens the international prestige of Qatar, which is set to host the 2022 soccer World Cup. Soccer’s governing body, FIFA, said on Monday it was in ”regular contact” with Qatar’s 2022 organizing committee, but did not comment directly on the diplomatic situation.  MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD Qatar’s backing of Islamists dates to a decision by the current emir’s father to end a tradition of automatic deference to Saudi Arabia, the dominant Gulf Arab power, and forge the widest possible array of allies. Doha subsequently cultivated not only Islamists like America’s foes Iran, Hamas and the Taliban in pursuit of leverage, but also Washington itself, hosting the largest U. S. air base in the Middle East. Qatar has for years presented itself as a mediator and power broker for the region’s many disputes. But Egypt and the Gulf Arab states resent Qatar’s support for Islamists, especially the Muslim Brotherhood, which they see as a political enemy. Muslim Brotherhood groups allied to Doha are now mostly on retreat in the region, especially after a 2013 military takeover in Egypt ousted the elected Islamist president. The former army chief and now president, Abdel Fattah   along with Cairo’s allies in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, blacklist the Brotherhood as a terrorist organization. The Brotherhood says it supports only peaceful politics. Saudi Arabia accused Qatar on Monday of backing militant groups and broadcasting their ideology, an apparent reference to Qatar’s influential   satellite channel al Jazeera. Later in the day, the kingdom shut the Saudi bureau of al Jazeera. Al Jazeera says it is an independent news service giving a voice to everyone in the region. Riyadh also accused Qatar of supporting what it described as   militants in the restive, largely Shi’ite   eastern Saudi region of Qatif, as well as in Bahrain. Qatar denied it was interfering in the affairs of others. ”The campaign of incitement is based on lies that had reached the level of complete fabrications,” the Qatari foreign ministry said in a statement. Turkey also called for dialogue to settle the dispute and a government spokesman said President Tayyip Erdogan was working for a diplomatic solution to the rift. Sudan expressed its concern over the row and offered to mediate between all sides. FALLOUT A split between Doha and its closest allies could have  repercussions around the Middle East, where Gulf states have used their financial and political power to influence events in Libya, Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Yemen. The economic fallout was already hitting home as Abu Dhabi’s   Etihad Airways, Dubai’s Emirates Airline and budget carriers Flydubai and Air Arabia said they would suspend all flights to and from Doha indefinitely from Tuesday morning. Qatar Airways said on its official website it had suspended all flights to Saudi Arabia. Many Gulf airports, including in Qatar, are major hubs for international connecting flights. The measures are more severe than during a previous   rift in 2014, when Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE withdrew their ambassadors from Doha, again alleging Qatari support for militant groups. At that time, travel links were maintained and Qataris were not expelled. Neighboring Kuwait has been mediating in the dispute, and its emir, Sheikh Sabah       urged Qatar’s ruler to calm tensions and refrain from escalating the rift, Kuwait state news agency Kuna said.   called on Qatar’s Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa   to give efforts at mediation a chance to contain differences, a few hours after Khalid   an adviser to the Saudi king, visited Kuwait.

{"article": "In his testimony today before the Senate Judiciary Committee (on which I’ll have more to say in an upcoming column) FBI director James Comey has stuck by his claim that declining to bring charges against Hillary Clinton for mishandling classified information was the right call because proof of intent was lacking. This is unsurprising. The director has repeated this analysis many times. It hasn’t gotten better with age, but given his insistence that “no reasonable prosecutor” could possibly disagree with him, I’m not holding my breath waiting for him to reverse himself. \tIn my column over the weekend, discussing a lengthy New York Times report about the Clinton   investigation, I briefly rehashed why Comey is wrong about this: \t\tThis is a convoluted part of the story, stemming from the Justice Department’s effective rewriting of the applicable statute to avoid charging Clinton. As the Times tells it, the Justice Department and the FBI knew that to charge Clinton with a crime, it would not be enough to prove she had been “sloppy or careless” instead, “they needed evidence showing that she knowingly received classified information or set up her server for that purpose. ” As I have contended before, this claim is specious on multiple levels. Subsection (f) of the pertinent statute (the Espionage Act, codified at Section 793 of Title 18, U. S. Code) makes it a felony to mishandle classified information “through gross negligence”  —   i. e. proving Clinton was sloppy or careless (or “extremely careless,” to use Comey’s own description) could have been sufficient. But beyond that, Clinton willfully set up a private network for the systematic handling of her State   communications, in violation of federal   requirements of which she was well aware, and under circumstances in which she (a former senator who served for years on the intelligence Armed Services committee) was a sophisticated longtime consumer of classified information. She was keenly aware that her responsibilities as secretary of state would heavily involve classified information  —   whether it was “marked” classified or “born classified” because of the subject matter. \t\tIt is irrelevant whether Clinton’s purpose was to transmit or store classified information on the private,   server prosecutors are not required to prove motive. The question is whether she knew classified information would end up on the server, and her   made that inevitable. \t\tThat is, Clinton could have been prosecuted either for willfully mishandling classified information or for doing so through gross negligence. \tAs I elaborate in the column, the Times did not address the controlling statute in its   article. Instead, the story was that Clinton could not be charged because of the purported Petraeus precedent. We are to believe that the evidence of former CIA director David Petreaus’s criminal intent was far stronger than Clinton’s, yet he was not charged with the felony mishandling of classified information (he was permitted to plead guilty to a misdemeanor) ergo, it would have been an abuse of prosecutorial discretion to charge Clinton with the felony. \tI addressed this in the column as well: \t\tThis line of reasoning is fatuous  —   and it’s another instance of the Justice Department adopting Clinton campaign cant. Petreaus shared his classified diaries with a single person, a paramour who actually had a security clearance (albeit not one high enough to view what she was shown). Clinton’s offense was more extensive in duration and seriousness. \t\tAssuming the accuracy of the Times’s account, Comey is quite right that Petraeus should have been indicted on much more serious charges (as I have contended). But the Justice Department’s dereliction in Petraeus’s case was hardly a justification for giving Clinton a pass on a more egregious offense that, unlike Petraeus’s, (a) almost certainly caused the compromise of government secrets to foreign intelligence services and (b) resulted in the destruction of tens of thousands of government records  —   a separate felony. Clinton’s misconduct should have been prosecuted under the governing law, not excused based on the sweetheart plea deal Petraeus got. \t\tAll that said, we’re told the FBI thought it might be able to get over the purported Petraeus hurdle if it could find   to and from Clinton’s old BlackBerry. Because she was using this device right before she switched to the homebrew server, the theory was that those lost   might contain some   declaration of her criminal intent in setting up the server system. It’s as if, in a drug case, it’s not enough for agents to have the bag of heroin they found in the suspected trafficker’s house to prove intent, you apparently also need an   in which the trafficker says, “Gee, I hope there’s enough heroin in that bag I was planning to sell. ” \tHillary Clinton is a   lawyer who worked in government for many years. She was a very active first lady during her husband’s   presidency  —   mainly in the White House, where the handling of classified information is a major issue, even for   staffers. I mistakenly said in the weekend column that she had served on the Intelligence Committee in the Senate but my memory lapse was due to having previously said, correctly and on many occasions, that her assignment to the Armed Services Committee during years when the nation was at war made her a heavy consumer of highly classified   information. \tWhen she became secretary of state, she was briefed on the rules governing the handling of classified information, which she well knew would feature prominently and persistently in her duties. In her memoir, Hard Choices, Mrs. Clinton goes on at length about the exacting security procedures she knew she had to follow in handling classified information (e. g. she needed to read classified documents under an “opaque tent” in her hotel rooms while on travel and it was foremost in her mind that State Department officials are “frequently the target of cyberattacks”). \tWhen she was interviewed by the FBI at the close of its investigation, Clinton made laughably false statements regarding her familiarity with   protocols, including the whopper that she did not know what “(C)” meant  —   even though it is the designation for information classified at the “confidential” level, ubiquitous in classified documents. Prosecutors routinely use false exculpatory statements to prove mens rea in a criminal case. (Relatedly, Clinton also told the FBI she could not recall being briefed about retaining government records and handling classified information even though she signed a form acknowledging that she had been so briefed on January 22, 2009.) Moreover, in newly released book Shattered, about the 2016 Clinton campaign, authors Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes relate the story of how Clinton directed a trusted aide to download the server from her failed 2008 campaign in order to peruse stored staff   so she could figure out who leaked to the press. \tPatently, Hillary Clinton was well aware of (a) the highly classified subject matter of communications that would inevitably be passing through the private   system she set up for State Department business, in violation of statutes and government rules (b) the fact that   are stored on servers (c) the fact that the communications facilities and devices used by State Department officials are routinely targeted in cyberattacks by foreign intelligence services and other hostile actors and (d) the rules for the proper handling of classified information (and potential penalties for mishandling it). Consequently, her mishandling of classified information was knowing and intentional, as well as grossly negligent. Many reasonable prosecutors would salivate at the prospect of taking such a case to court, especially if they knew that Clinton was going to run with a “lack of intent” defense.

{"article": "During the buildup to the AFC championship game in the Mile High City, the spotlight was fixed on Manning and Brady, the two future Hall of Fame quarterbacks who were meeting for the 17th, and perhaps final time on the gridiron. But it was the Denver defense that stole the show, intercepting Brady twice in the opening half and making two crucial fourth down stops late in the fourth quarter to snuff out potentially game tying scoring drives, including one with just 2:18 on the clock. The Patriots, however, would not quit and with 12 seconds left Brady hit Rob Gronkowski with a   touchdown pass. Needing a   convert to force overtime, the Denver defense again dug in, with Bradley Roby stepping in front of Brady’s pass attempt to preserve the victory and a spot in their   eighth Super Bowl. Manning, who had been plagued by injury and questionable form all season, turned in a performance worthy of a   NFL Most valuable player, tossing a pair of first half touchdowns to Owen Daniels. ”To be going to our second Super Bowl in four years is very special and just an awesome effort by our entire team,” Manning, who will become the oldest quarterback to play in a Super Bowl, told the Denver crowd. ”And what an incredible effort by the Patriots, for us to beat that team today, a very special win.” ”It’s been a special rivalry (with Brady) over the course of our career . .. I just wanted to take the time to share with Tom (Brady) and Bill (Belichick) how much respect I have for them and just what special coaches and players they are.” Added Denver coach Gary Kubiak: ”Defensively we played our tails off all year long and found a way to win another close one.” Denver’s pass rush that led the league in sacks kept Brady under pressure the entire game, forcing the Patriots quarterback to hurry passes and miss targets. Brady completed 27 of 56 pass attempts for 310 yards but was sacked four times, intercepted twice and picked off again on a   attempt as New England’s Super Bowl defense ended. ”For it to come down to a   conversion obviously is a tough way to finish the season,” offered a dejected Brady after the game.  ”You make some, you’re not going to make them all.” ”It was a tough day. Hard fought football game. (The Broncos) put a lot of pressure on you. ”We had some tough plays we just didn’t make them. Just came up one play short.” Denver got the game off to a flying start, as Manning marched the Broncos 83 yards on their opening possession, completing the drive with a   dart to Daniels. Brady, meanwhile, was unable to do much against Denver’s top ranked defense until Jonathan Freeny alertly scooped up a Manning backward pass giving New England the ball on the Broncos 22. Two plays later Steven Jackson powered over from the one. Denver, however, maintained a   lead when Stephen Gostkowski missed his first extra point in 10 years. The Broncos also capitalized on a turnover, Von Miller intercepting Brady at the New England 20 and Manning quickly arching a   touchdown strike to Daniels. The half ended with the Broncos and Patriots hitting on long field goals to send Denver into the break up  . The Patriots began the second half chipping away at the Denver lead with Gostkowski connecting on a   field for the only score of the quarter. Denver’s Brandon McManus answered with a   field goal in the fourth quarter to restore the Broncos’ eight point cushion before Brady mounted a last ditch Patriots rally.  (Editing by Andrew Both.

{"article": "After waiting 58 years to return to a major tournament, Wales made up for lost time with a thrilling victory that gets their Euro 2016 campaign off to the best possible start. It was a dramatic match that swung one way and then the other before Hal   who is currently out of contract with Reading, upstaged Gareth Bale to emerge as an unlikely hero. Introduced as a   substitute, and at a time when the game was in danger of slipping away from Wales after Ondrej Duda had come off the bench to equalise for Slovakia with his first touch,   steered home a   shot to spark wild celebrations on the pitch and in the stands. It was only his third international goal and, with only nine minutes remaining, could not have been timed better. That Joe Ledley, who broke his leg five weeks ago to the day, was involved in the buildup to the defining moment in the match only added to the sense of satisfaction for Wales at the final whistle. Bale flung his head back and roared into the sky at the end of an absorbing game of football that left Chris Coleman’s players looking physically and emotionally drained. The sight of three points on the board should help to accelerate their recovery and, given the new format that opens the door for four   teams to qualify for the knockout stage, Wales could be forgiven for thinking they already have one foot in the last 16. At the very least, they can go into the “Battle of Britain” with England in Lens on Thursday full of confidence and with the pressure off. Bale, as ever, delivered for his country, yet this was not one of those days when it was all about the world’s most expensive footballer. The Real Madrid forward scored a superb   to put Wales ahead and had a powerful header saved in the second half, but for long periods of the game Bale was on the periphery, bereft of service and isolated in attack, no more so than in the   spell at the start of the second half when Slovakia took control of the game. With the excellent Marek Hamsik becoming more and more influential and Wales unable to retain possession, Duda’s   equaliser had been coming. The worry for Wales was that Slovakia were not finished there, which is why Coleman’s decision to bring on Ledley and   was so crucial, not just in terms of their contribution to the winning goal but also to break up the rhythm of the game. There was also something else that happened around the time of those substitutions that captured the mood on this historical day for Wales. With the team looking like they were running on empty, the 25, 000 Wales fans inside the stadium broke into a stirring rendition of the national anthem. Little wonder that Bale said afterwards that it felt like a home game for Wales. It was quite an occasion for Danny Ward, the    Liverpool goalkeeper who was drafted into the team on the eve of the match after Wayne Hennessey was forced to pull out after suffering a back spasm. Ward made his Wales debut only in March and had never previously started a game for his country, but he is entitled to be proud of his performance, as well as a touch relieved that Adam Nemec’s late header struck the upright. Wales will feel that they did enough to deserve that break. After a nervous start, when Hamsik slalomed through the Wales defence and was denied a brilliant individual goal only by Ben Davies’s superb clearance, Coleman’s side started to move the ball with more belief and grew into the game. Bale’s goal was a beauty and there was a sense of inevitability about what was going to happen from the moment that Jonny Williams was brought down by Patrik Hrosovsky 30 yards from goal. Matus Kozacik, the Slovakia goalkeeper, lined up his wall but made the fatal mistake of taking a step to his left just as Bale started his   leaving a gaping hole on the other side of the goal. Bale, with a dipping   thumped the ball into that area and, although it was not in the corner, Kozacik had too much ground to make up to try and get across his goal. Wales were aggrieved they never had a chance to double their advantage from the penalty spot when Martin Skrtel, trying to shepherd the ball out of play, elbowed Jonny Williams in the face. That incident went unpunished, unlike the poor defending that Duda exposed to equalise shortly after he came on. Robert Mak got away from Aaron Ramsey and Dave Edwards far too easily on the Slovakia right and the winger’s neat   was dispatched by Duda, who drilled a low shot across Ward and into the far corner. Bale and Ramsey both had headed opportunities either side of Duda’s goal but Slovakia also continued to threaten as the game became stretched. Wales badly needed some inspiration and they got it via the substitutes’ bench. Ledley, on for Edwards, threaded the ball into the feet of Ramsey, who nicked it past Skrtel and, a little fortuitously, into the path of  . Shooting on the turn, the striker scuffed the ball through the legs of Jan Durica and past Kozacik. Wales were in dreamland.", "prop": 0.08169208235259297},

{"article": " (CNN) Meryl Streep was honored at the Golden Globes for a lifetime of notable work, and she took the opportunity to make a sustained attack on US   Donald Trump.

Related: Trump attacks Streep for speech at Golden Globes, As the audience of Hollywood stars and executives sat in silence, Streep said: ”There was one performance this year that stunned me. It sank its hooks in my heart. Not because it was good, there was nothing good about it, but it was effective and it did its job. ”It was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter. Someone he outranked in privilege, power and the capacity to fight back.” Streep’s comments were a reference to a rally by Trump in November 2015 when he imitated New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, who has a condition that affects his joint movements. Trump has always denied he was mocking the reporter. In an interview with the The New York Times Monday morning, Trump said he was ”not surprised” by the criticism from ”liberal movie people,” pointing out that Streep was a supporter of his defeated rival, Hillary Clinton. Streep used her speech to highlight the importance to American culture of outsiders and foreigners, whom she said were among the ”most vilified segments in American society right now.   ”Hollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners and if we kick them all out, you’ll have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts, which are not the arts,” Streep said to huge applause from the room.

At the Globes and online, Streep received support from her peers.  Audience members listened with rapt attention.

According to The Seattle Times, the NRA filed a lawsuit in August to block the implementation of the tax, but King County Superior Court Judge Palmer Robinson “dismissed” the suit. The NRA cited the fact that Washington state has a preemption statute, which “forbids municipalities from passing regulations that impact ‘registration, licensing, possession, purchase, sale, acquisition, transfer, discharge, and transportation   …     or any other element’ of firearm ownership or commerce. ” But Judge Robinson viewed the tax as something other than regulatory in nature, and thereby upheld Seattle’s right to tax firearms and ammunition.

Chinese authorities have rolled out the red carpet for leaders including India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, the South Korean president, Park   Brazil’s president, Michel Temer, and the British prime minister, Theresa May, who touched down on Sunday morning.  But the leader of the world’s largest economy, who is on his final tour of Asia, was forced to disembark from Air Force One through a   exit in the plane’s belly after no rolling staircase was provided when he landed in the eastern Chinese city on Saturday afternoon. When Obama did find his way on to a red carpet on the tarmac below there were heated altercations between US and Chinese officials, with one Chinese official caught on video shouting: “This is our country! This is our airport!” “The reception that President Obama and his staff got when they arrived here Saturday afternoon was bruising, even by Chinese standards,” the New York Times reported.  Jorge Guajardo, Mexico’s former ambassador to China, said he was convinced Obama’s treatment was part of a calculated snub. “These things do not happen by mistake. Not with the Chinese,” Guajardo, who hosted presidents Enrique Peña Nieto and Felipe Calderón during his time in Beijing, told the Guardian.  “I’ve dealt with the Chinese for six years. I’ve done these visits. I took Xi Jinping to Mexico. I received two Mexican presidents in China. I know exactly how these things get worked out. It’s down to the last detail in everything. It’s not a mistake. It’s not. ” Guajardo added: “It’s a snub. It’s a way of saying: ‘You know, you’re not that special to us.’ It’s part of the new Chinese arrogance. It’s part of stirring up Chinese nationalism. It’s part of saying: ‘China stands up to the superpower.’ It’s part of saying: ‘And by the way, you’re just someone else to us.’ It works very well with the local audience. “Why [did it happen]?” the former diplomat, who was ambassador from 2007 until 2013, added. “I guess it is part of Xi Jinping playing the nationalist card. That’s my guess. ” Bill Bishop, a China expert whose Sinocism newsletter tracks the country’s political scene, agreed that Obama’s welcome looked suspiciously like a deliberate slight intended “to make the Americans look diminished and weak”. “It sure looks like a   snub,” Bishop said. “This clearly plays very much into the [idea]: ‘Look, we can make the American president go out of the ass of the plane. ’”  Bishop added: “We’ve no proof. It could clearly just be a   but it would be a stunningly large   given how well these people plan for all these events and especially for something like the G20. The idea that they have been preparing for well over a year for the G20 but suddenly there be a malfunction with the ramp just for one president   …     that really strains credulity. ” A Chinese foreign ministry official involved in the visit denied it had been a snub, telling the South China Morning Post the US delegation had declined to use the usual rolling   staircase.  “It would do China no good in treating Obama rudely,” the official, who declined to be named, was quoted as saying.  “China provides a rolling staircase for every arriving state leader, but the US side complained that the driver doesn’t speak English and can’t understand security instructions from the United States so China proposed that we could assign a translator to sit beside the driver, but the US side turned down the proposal and insisted that they didn’t need the staircase provided by the airport,” the official added. The US president offered a diplomatic reply when asked to comment on the airport “kerfuffle” on Sunday during a joint press conference with Theresa May. “I wouldn’t   the significance of it because, as I said, this is not the first time that these things happen and it doesn’t just happen here. It happens in a lot of places including, by the way, sometimes our allies,” Obama said, adding that “none of this detracts from the broader scope of the relationship”. Obama suggested his Chinese hosts might have found the size of the US delegation “a little overwhelming”.  “We’ve got a lot of planes, a lot of helicopters, a lot of cars and a lot of guys. If you are a host country, sometimes it may feel a little bit much. ”  Susan Rice, the US national security adviser, admitted she had been surprised by the handling of the president’s arrival. “They did things that weren’t anticipated,” she told reporters.  The New York Times said Rice had appeared “baffled and annoyed” that the president had been forced to leave Air Force One through a door normally reserved for   trips to places such as Afghanistan.  In the   to the final meeting between Obama and Xi, experts had predicted the pair would seek to part ways on a positive note with the announcement that the world’s two largest polluters would ratify the Paris climate agreement.  However, Obama’s unconventional welcome  —   and a series of subsequent skirmishes and quarrels between Chinese and US officials and journalists  —   were a reminder of the underlying tensions.  The Washington Post said Obama’s bumpy landing in China was “a fitting reflection of how the relationship between these two world powers has become frayed and fraught with frustration”.  “I think this time   …     maybe the seams were showing a little more than usual in terms of some of the negotiations and jostling that takes place behind the scenes,” Obama admitted on Sunday.  Official statements issued by both sides on Saturday, as the pair held more than four hours of bilateral meetings, hinted at some of the disagreements between the world’s two largest economies.  According to a White House statement, Obama told Xi of “America’s unwavering support for upholding human rights”.  “China opposes any other country interfering in its internal affairs in the name of human rights issues,” Xi told Obama in response, according to Xinhua, Beijing’s official news wire.  In an interview with CNN, Obama warned Beijing against   in the South China Sea. Xi told Obama his country would “unswervingly safeguard” its claims in the region.  Bishop said: “Other than in climate, in most areas of the   relationship there is increasing amounts of friction and some actually increasingly quite hot friction around the South China Sea and some of these military [interactions] in the region. ” “The US is looking a little weak and a little tired and I think [Beijing is] happy to put anybody in their place when they can. I think they see the opportunity to make Obama look weak,” he added.  Both Bishop and Guajardo said the reported confrontations between Chinese and US officials and journalists following Obama’s arrival in Hangzhou were par for the course in China. “That is just typical China. I remember when my president came, one of the Mexican press corps came out of it with stitches,” Guajardo recalled. But Obama’s unceremonious arrival was unusual and surely deliberate, the former Mexican ambassador added. “Just as the Chinese are about giving face they are also about not giving it and letting you know that they are not giving it to you   …     They don’t overlook these things by mistake. It’s not who they are. It’s not the way they do these things,” he said. ", "prop": 0.8705979792860792},

{"article": "’Read Melania Trump’s lawsuit here’] Melania Trump filed a lawsuit Thursday against the Daily Mail and a Maryland political blogger for defamation for publishing what she said are false stories about her past. Trump is suing the outlets  —   which include Webster Griffin Tarpley, who runs Tarpley. net, a political website  —   over stories that claimed she worked as a “  escort” and that she suffered from a “  nervous breakdown” due to the stress of the campaigning, according to her complaint. The suit said Trump is suing each outlet for “in excess” of $75, 000  —   her lawyer said she will seek $150 million. Trump states in her lawsuit that those accusations are blatantly false. “[Trump] did legitimate and legal modeling work for legitimate business entities,” the complaint states. “[Trump] was not an escort or prostitute. [Trump] did not have an apoplectic fit, apoplectic tantrum, nervous breakdown or mental breakdown, nor is she terrified or obsessed by fear about revelations from her past. ” Trump’s lawyer, Charles Harder, who recently represented Hulk Hogan in his battle with Gawker, released this statement on behalf of his client: “These defendants made several statements about Mrs. Trump that are 100% false and tremendously damaging to her personal and professional reputation. Defendants broadcast their lies to millions of people throughout the U. S. and the world —  without any justification,” he said. “Their many lies include, among others, that Mrs. Trump supposedly was an “escort” in the 1990s before she met her husband. Defendants’ actions are so egregious, malicious and harmful to Mrs. Trump that her damages are estimated at $150 million dollars. ” The Daily Mail responded Thursday to the lawsuit publishing a lengthy retraction. In the retraction, the newspaper states their article merely discussed allegations that were made about Trump in a book on Amazon and in an article by a Slovenian magazine. But the newspaper said it did not intend to state that the allegations that Trump worked as an escort or in the sex business were true. “To the extent that anything in the Daily Mail’s article was interpreted as stating or suggesting that Mrs. Trump worked as an ‘escort’ or in the ‘sex business,’ that she had a ‘composite or presentation card for the sex business,’ or that either of the modeling agencies referenced in the article were engaged in these businesses, it is hereby retracted, and the Daily Mail newspaper regrets any such misinterpretation. ” Tarpley also responded saying Trump’s lawsuit against him is “without merit. ” Tarpley said he is confident that Trump will not be able to prove the statements about her on his website were defamatory. He added, “her lawsuit is a blatant attempt to intimidate not only me but journalists of all stripes into remaining silent with regard to public figures.

{"article": "For all the criticism of Golden State’s Draymond Green and his penchant for committing flagrant fouls during these playoffs, Wednesday may have brought the harshest words yet. The critic: Green himself. Saying he let the Warriors down and that he was a “terrible ” Green spoke on how it pained him to be suspended for Game 5 of the NBA finals  —   and how he will make amends on Thursday night in Game 6, when the Warriors visit the Cleveland Cavaliers and get another shot at winning what would be their second straight championship. “I owe to my   to come back and give all that I have, all that I can do to better this situation,” Green said. “I have strong belief that if I play Game 5, we win. But I didn’t because I put myself in a situation where I wasn’t able to play. ” He added: “The way I view it, [I was an] awful, terrible   and I take pride at being better. ” Golden State lead the series   but now knows they will play the rest of the series without starting center Andrew Bogut because of a left knee injury. Green  —   who missed Game 5 because of how many flagrants he has accrued during the playoffs  —   will be called upon to play some center in Game 6, as he has plenty of times in this postseason already. “Draymond is the spirit of what we do,” said Warriors guard Stephen Curry, the NBA’s   reigning MVP. “You see it out on the floor. ” This series is back in Cleveland largely because LeBron James and Kyrie Irving could not be stopped in Game 5, when the Warriors’ best defender was watching the Cavaliers’ star duo score 41 points apiece from a suite at the adjacent baseball stadium that the Oakland Athletics call home. Green alone could not have stopped their onslaught, but it surely stands to reason that life would have been more difficult for Cleveland if he was in uniform. Without Green, the Warriors lost by 15. He’s already spoken to his   about his mistakes, and made clear that watching Game 5 from next door left him hurting. “Everybody’s helped with Draymond being on the floor,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “So that will be nice to have him back. We missed him the other night. We were disappointed in our performance without him. We thought we could still get it done, but we didn’t. So now it’s time to recharge the batteries and get ready. ” The straw that got Green suspended was when he took a swipe at James’ groin area in Game 4. But when asked what he expected when he sees Green in Game 6, James showed he’s only focused on bigger pictures and no    battle. “My only job is to get this win, man,” James said. Green met with reporters before practice, and didn’t shy away from his mistakes in these playoffs. Some thought he merited a suspension when he kicked Oklahoma City’s Steven Adams in the groin area during the Western Conference finals. The NBA upgraded the foul and fined him after reviewing that play, and when another flagrant was assessed    for taking the shot at James a suspension was automatic. “I move on from the suspension. We move on. It was Game 5. We’re here in Game 6,” Green said. “So it’s behind us. We’ve got an opportunity to do something that, I don’t know if it’s ever been done . .. where you win a championship on someone else’s floor two years in a row. ” Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue was asked if his team might try to prod Green a bit, knowing another flagrant foul or two technicals in Game 6 would mean another suspension for Game 7. “You just play the game,” Lue said. Green, who acknowledged that he’s been working on keeping emotions in check, didn’t sound worried. “I think I’ve got to come out and play my game regardless,” Green said. “But there are those little fine lines where you just know you can’t cross them. ” If Cleveland win, Game 7 is in Oakland on Sunday. If Cleveland lose, the Warriors will celebrate on the Cavs’ home floor for the second consecutive year  —   exactly one year to the day from last year’s clincher. And if Golden State get to spray champagne the cramped visiting locker room at Quicken Loans Arena around again, those bubbles will likely wash away most of not all the sting Green is feeling for letting his team down. “Nobody will remember this down the road if we get this done tomorrow night,” Curry said. “So that’s really all we need to talk about. ”", "prop": 0.11631681786572046},
{"article": "On the 2016 campaign trail, Donald Trump has insisted that he is worth more than $10bn. However, a statement filed to the Securities and Exchange Commission by Wells Fargo Securities on Trump’s behalf in 2012 indicated that the real estate developer was then worth less than half that, with comparatively few of the liquid assets that may now finance his campaign for president. In the document, which concerned the securitization of commercial mortgages on properties including Trump Tower in New York City, Trump was described as being worth more than $4. 2bn, with liquid assets of more than $250m.  A passage in the   filing says: “The sponsor is Donald J Trump. Mr Trump has significant commercial real estate holdings worldwide including interests in office, retail, residential,   and hospitality properties in markets including New York, San Francisco, Florida, Washington DC, and Scotland. As of 30 June 2011, Mr Trump reports a net worth in excess of $4. 2bn and liquidity in excess of $250m. ” The Trump campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  Jessica Ong, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo, insisted the 2012 filing was correct.  She said: “Obviously, if it was inaccurate, we wouldn’t have filed it with the SEC. ” While $250m is a large amount of money, it is nowhere near enough to finance a modern presidential campaign. Trump has already loaned between $43m and $50m to his campaign, raising questions about how much he can afford to continue to spend without selling off assets or taking on significant loans.  Trump has insisted that he has far more than $250m in liquid assets, last year telling Fox News anchor Sean Hannity he had $400m, all of which he was prepared to use. In sworn testimony for a 2007 lawsuit, deposition transcripts show, Trump was asked by a lawyer whether he had “ever exaggerated in statements about your properties?” “I think everyone does,” Trump answered. The lawyer pressed: “Does that mean that sometimes you’ll inflate the value of your properties in your statements?” “Not beyond reason,” Trump said. Trump’s claim to be able to   his campaign has been a foundation of his   successful claim to be independent of the Washington establishment. Although he is now frantically building a fundraising apparatus, he has insisted this is simply to help the Republican National Committee (RNC) raise money for the party as a whole. His campaign reported only $1. 3m “cash on hand” to begin the month of June, in contrast to Hillary Clinton’s $42. 5m. The RNC has not seemed overly concerned. Speaking to CNN in June, the group’s chief strategist, Sean Spicer, said that if Trump “wanted to get that [fundraising] number up in two seconds, he just strokes a check and it’s up”. The Trump campaign has insisted that the businessman has converted his loan into a donation. No such paperwork has yet been filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC).  The 2012 SEC filing contradicts a claim made by Trump in November 2011, in which he said he had a net worth of more than $7bn and insisted that he derived almost $3bn from the value of his personal brand. In May 2016, Trump filed a statement with the FEC in which he insisted his “net worth is in excess of $10bn”. The disclosure indicated that he had taken on at least $50m in debt and sold off assets in the past year. While the statement from Wells Fargo indicates that Trump may be far less wealthy than he claims, it would also indicate that he is in better financial shape than many financial experts believe, unless he has suffered significant undisclosed financial losses in recent years.  Fortune magazine has estimated that Trump is currently worth $3. 9bn in 2015, Bloomberg News assessed Trump’s fortune at $2. 9bn.

{"article": "Police in Malaysia announced this week the arrest of fifteen people suspected of fundraising, recruiting, and attempting to purchase and amass   materials for the Islamic State (  ) terrorist group. One of those arrested is a police officer. [Reuters reports that some of the fifteen suspects are believed to have been operating together under the orders of Muhammad Wanndy Mohamed Jedi, an Islamic State operative with Malaysian roots, located in Syria. Some were plotting an attack within Malaysia’s borders, while others were working to recruit more jihadis for the cause or fundraise to help bring plots to fruition.  They were involved in collecting funds to be channeled to an Islamic   group in the southern Philippines and arranging the movement of “two foreign terror suspects” from Malaysia to a Southeast Asian country, [Malaysian Inspector General] Khalid Abu Bakar said. Other activities included attempting to acquire chemicals to make bombs, recruiting Malaysians to join Islamic State in Syria, collecting funds from Islamic State sympathizers in Malaysia and setting up working arrangements with militant groups around Southeast Asia, he said. Malaysian officials have grown increasingly tense regarding the potential threat of an Islamic State attack in the Southeast Asian country, which boasts a majority Muslim population. On Friday, a shopping mall in Peringgit shut down after a written note surfaced claiming terrorists had planted four bombs around the mall. While the threat proved to be a false alarm, the swiftness with which Malaysian authorities reacted highlights the fears of a potential successful terror attack unfolding in the near future. Malaysian police announced this week an initiative not just to capture and contain Islamic State jihadists, but to counter their propaganda online. “We cannot afford to wait,” Inspector General Khalid said on Friday. “That’s why every single piece of information, no matter how small that links a person with Daesh members, we will take action against them. ” The initiative will launch April 1 and will boast an online   recruitment team in every state of Malaysia. Police did not provide details on what the   messaging centers will post online specifically. Earlier this month, Malaysian authorities announced they had thwarted an Islamic State plan to abduct Prime Minister Najib Razak, as well as several of his ministers. “On January 30, 2015, there were plans by 13 people linked to Daesh [Islamic State] to kidnap the country’s leaders including the Prime Minister, the Home Minister and the Defence Minister,” Home Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi told reporters. “Although there is no proper Daesh establishment in the country, those here [in Malaysia] were being influenced and have been receiving orders from the IS network in Syria,” he explained. The arrests this week prove the ties between ISIS jihadists in Syria and supporters in Malaysia. The Islamic State is far from the only jihadist group operating in Malaysia, however. Malaysia’s The Star reported in January that there are four major Syrian rebel   jihadi groups recruiting in Malaysia: “the IS, Ajnad   the   Front (also known as   in Syria) and the Free Syrian Army. ” The Malaysian government and native Islamist groups also work to impose Islam as a state religion, though they denounce the Islamic State. The government admitted this week that it has made lists of “liberal Muslim” citizens to be targeted. The “deviants”  —   labeled such for believing in   ideals such as “pluralism,” will be the target of “efforts to sway them back to traditional religious beliefs. ” Among deviant activities, according to Sharia, as practiced in Malaysia are public interactions between men and women, including hugs and kisses on the cheek and any interaction with dogs, which are considered haram [forbidden].", "prop": 0.6951395255599112},
{"article": " Donald Trump thinks you’re an idiot. Not just you, though. Pretty much all Americans.  Catherine Rampell is an opinion columnist at The Washington Post. View Archive   Facebook Google+   He seems to have taken a timeless insight often attributed to H. L. Mencken  —   that no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American people  —   and applied it to politics. Don’t believe me? Take but one recent, nearly   example.  On Sunday’s “Face the Nation,” host John Dickerson asked the Republican presidential   what he took away from a recent church service that he attended in Iowa. The subject of the sermon: humility.   Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump spoke in front of a crowd in Iowa following the caucuses. Trump finished second to Ted Cruz. (Reuters)   Behold this   exchange: TRUMP: “It was very good. It was very a nice service, beautiful church. I liked it. ”  DICKERSON: “But humility, a lot of people don’t think  —   your name is on everything. You have often talked about sometimes braggadocio is part of your pitch. ”  TRUMP: “No, I know, but there is more humility than you would think, believe me. ”  DICKERSON: “Hidden humility. ”  TRUMP: “We are all the same. We’re all going to the same place, probably one of two places, you know, but we are all the same. And I do have actually much more humility than a lot of people would think. ”  Got that? Trump is very, very, unbelievably, terrifically humble. And (with apologies to Churchill) he has much to be humble about.  Trump, after all, is a man who has previously declared himself to be, in roughly his own words: ● Really rich; very rich; very smart; very handsome; very strong on the Second Amendment; very strong on border security; very, very strong on the debt limit; very loyal, to a fault.  ●In possession of the world’s greatest memory, as well as one of the highest IQs.  ●   but not necessarily one of these people who sits there all day and thinks about himself.  ●Like Ronald Reagan, FDR, Batman.  ●Loving of   beloved by the Mexican people, China, Iowans, “the blacks,” “the Muslims,” women, everybody.  ●Very friendly with a lot of people on both sides of the aisle, a very nice person who gets along very well with people, a great unifier.  ●The worst thing that ever happened to the Islamic State, the least bigoted of anybody you’ve ever met, the least racist person on earth, the person who will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.  And of course: ●A candidate who could shoot somebody in the middle of New York’s Fifth Avenue and not lose voters. If these aren’t the statements of someone with boatloads of humility, well, maybe Trump doesn’t know what the word “humility” means.  Or, more likely, he doesn’t think the rest of us do. Likewise, on issues besides his own character, Trump has also taken to   voters’ intelligence.  He absurdly promised to make Mexico pay for a big, beautiful wall that would keep Mexicans out of the United States. (In my fantasies, this wall would really be a scheme to make Mexico and the United States fall madly in love, “Fantasticks” ; alas, such an outcome seems unlikely.)  Among his other infrastructure priorities is a new $100 million ballroom for the White House. “We’ll get the top people, the top everything, we’ll have the best ballroom,” he said at a recent political rally, as if he believed this were really a   policy issue crucial to the success of the American republic.  He promised that his tax plan would raise taxes on the rich and not reduce revenue, even though basic arithmetic and the most generous of economic assumptions say the opposite. He promised to get rid of Obamacare and replace it with “something terrific” but as yet unspecified. He promised to grow the nation’s economy by 6 percent or 7 percent, when the Federal Reserve predicts   growth rates of 2 percent.  Only someone who thinks Americans are really, really dumb would expect voters to buy any of this.  Of course, Trump is hardly the only candidate to treat voters like we have IQs around room temperature.  Other candidates’ tax plans, foreign policy proposals, regulatory schemes and economic predictions also often depend on assumptions of widespread idiocy within the populace. And to some extent, this has always been true. But Trump, innovative political entrepreneur that he is, has just gone bigger and bolder, assuming Americans are even dumber than anyone ever thought possible. Not that Americans themselves agree. In a recent Pew Research Center poll, about   of respondents said that the word “intelligent” describes the typical American fairly or very well.  The next few months will help determine who’s right.   Read more on this topic:   The Post’s View: The ‘ism’ that describes Mr. Trump best   Dana Milbank: Republican elites surrender to Trump   E. J.

{"article": "It’s tempting to look to the playbooks and historical traditions of the late Soviet Union to explain the audacity of today’s Russian intelligence activity, from its meddling in U. S. elections, to apparently killing Kremlin opponents abroad. But these activities are not just products of old ways or new geopolitics. They also stem from a shift in the activities of Russia’s political police force, the infamous Federal Security Service (FSB). Originally established to protect the Kremlin’s rule at home, it has increasingly moved into Russia’s foreign operations. A new cohort of secret policemen, ignorant of the traditions of spycraft and secure in Putin’s protection, has fundamentally altered the nature of Russian intelligence. The FSB stands accused not just of engineering the leaks against Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, but also backing extremist parties in Europe, stirring up discontent among   minorities in the Baltic, allegedly murdering Chechen opposition leaders in Turkey and Austria, spreading disinformation, and even kidnapping an Estonian security officer across the border in 2014. And according to the infamous unverified dossier published by Buzzfeed on January 10, it also collected compromising information on Trump with the suspected aim of turning him into Vladimir Putin’s puppet. One has to go back to Soviet times for such a rich array of proven and suspected covert adventures abroad. The Biggest Intelligence Questions Raised by the Trump Dossier, By allowing the FSB to move into foreign intelligence and covert operations, though, Putin has —  probably inadvertently —  unleashed a beast. The FSB is playing a central role in current developments not because it possesses greater technical capabilities than the other Russian agencies, but because, for the most part, it does not recognize or respect the same limitations as the rest of Russia’s security services. To put it crudely, the FSB does the kinds of things everyone else thinks about doing but doesn’t because they’re too risky, too politically inflammatory, or too likely to backfire. The FSB is just the latest,   iteration of the old Soviet KGB. In one of his many toxic legacies, former Russian President Boris Yeltsin ignored calls to disband an institution that appeared beyond repair and rebuild it from scratch. Instead, after 1991, he opted to partition the KGB. Its first chief directorate, responsible for espionage, was simply rebranded as the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). Most of the directorates tasked with domestic security were gathered together first under the umbrella of the Ministry of Security, then the Federal   Service, and, in 1995, the FSB. Since then, the FSB has not looked back, especially after 1998, when for a brief time it was headed by a     officer whose career was about to experience an unexpected boost —  one Vladimir Putin. In the years since, the FSB has been one his staunchest allies, hounding and discrediting his rivals, looking after his underlings, and clamping down on any spasms of popular protest. In return, he has shielded, empowered, and elevated the agency, turning a blind eye to corruption in its ranks, allowing it to   rival agencies such as the Federal   Service (Russia’s equivalent to the DEA, which was abolished in 2016) and giving its officers key positions, from regional governorships to head of his security council. Traditionally, Putin controlled Russia’s sprawling bureaucracy by creating multiple, overlapping agencies, that he would then play off against each other. This is especially evident within the intelligence community. In Ukraine, for example, the SVR, FSB, and GRU, the military intelligence agency, all ran competing operations. When former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych was toppled by the “Euromaidan” revolution in 2014, catching Moscow by surprise, the result was a hurried game of   . Although the FSB had been the agency most closely associated with Yanukovych and had argued most forcefully that he would survive, it enjoyed Putin’s support, and so the SVR wound up taking the blame for the intelligence failure. One result of the agencies fighting over the same turf has been the increasing intrusion of the FSB into foreign operations. In 2003, the agency absorbed most of the electronic eavesdropping and   capabilities of FAPSI, Russia’s equivalent of the NSA. In 2005, it began operating in   neighboring states. In 2006, Russia passed a law allowing military force to be used “to suppress international terrorist activity outside the Russian Federation” —  just before the murder of defector Alexander Litvinenko in London. As the FSB’s stature rose, that of its competitors in Russian intelligence was falling. By the late 2000s, the GRU was in disgrace, due to its blunders in Russia’s 2008 war with Georgia, leading to abandoned airfields being bombed and Russian units getting outflanked. Putin also felt the SVR was too conservative and timid for limiting itself to simple  . It had failed to present Washington as being as aggressive as he believed it to be. He was increasingly coming to believe that the United States was leading a campaign to isolate Russia and deny it the   status he felt it deserved. He saw the “Color Revolutions,” for example, as U. S.  plots to topple   governments (Georgia in 2003, Ukraine in 2004, and Kyrgyzstan in 2005) and interpreted NATO’s 2011 intervention in Libya as a sign that Washington remained committed to aggressive regime change. The more Putin came to see the West as a threat, the more he felt he needed his spooks both to collect information and to serve as active instruments of his geopolitical ambitions. This perspective seems to have crystallized during his brief time as prime minister and as the power behind the throne, from 2008 to 2012. The FSB scrambled to fill the spook gap left by the flailing GRU and SVR. Suddenly, it was briefing Putin on foreign policy, edging its way into the traditional turf of the SVR and the foreign ministry. It lobbied hard and successfully for the funds and the mandate to mount political operations, first in Europe, then beyond, from funneling resources to populist parties and separatist groups, to penetrating both Democratic and, to a limited extent, Republican National Committee computers. When an indiscreet conversation between Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and U. S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt emerged in 2014, it was almost certainly both intercepted and then leaked by the FSB. It may even have hijacked SVR and GRU operations: Intelligence insiders told me of FSB reports that claimed credit for information gathered by other agencies. The FSB could do all this because it had Putin’s trust, and because it realized that he increasingly wanted his spies to tell him what he wanted to hear. As one embittered former SVR officer put it to me, “our mistake was to keep talking about the world as it is, not as he would like it to be. ” Thus, the FSB’s political police officers flattered their way into a privileged position, getting tasked with manipulating elections, wooing electorates, and lobbying politicians across the West. These are not just spies under a different acronym, though. Most do not know or respect the etiquette of the shadow war. Their backgrounds as secret police in an authoritarian state make them especially prone to bullying and blackmailing, corrupting and killing. They also operate under far fewer constraints than traditional spies. So long as they remain in Putin’s favor, they can (sometimes literally) get away with murder. Even Russia’s   Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, once able to challenge the spies, is now limited to cleaning up their messes. This has all resulted in a brazen new turn in Russian intelligence operations, with the FSB at the helm. They were behind the   kidnapping of Estonian security officer Eston Kohver in 2014, and, according to sources in Moscow, were behind the DNC leaks, even if the GRU actually collected the emails. They are the ones most eagerly backing and bankrolling divisive extremists and populist leaders in Europe. This is despite the fact that the SVR and GRU have a great deal more experience. But the FSB’s greatest asset is its sheer willingness to take chances. In that respect, it is simply mirroring Putin himself, who has played his weak hand well, precisely by —  at least in the   era —  being more unpredictable and confrontational than anyone else. How will this work out in the long term? When the FSB kidnapped Kohver, it managed to draw attention to the very issue it sought to keep hidden: its own links with organized crime, which subsequently became the focus of more intensive investigation in both Estonia and Europe as a whole. One Italian   officer who had for years been warning about this problem, for example, told me that within a month he had been given the green light to open new investigations into corruption among Russian security officials. Similarly, the agency’s hacking of Western politics looks worryingly effective, but is generating a backlash in the West against Russian interference and disinformation. It has become the story of the moment on both sides of the Atlantic, with the German and French security services warning that Moscow will try to manipulate upcoming elections in both countries. Just as dangerously, the SVR, GRU, and other agencies, have followed the FSB’s lead in tailoring their briefings to flatter Putin’s prejudices and assumptions. As a result, the one man who decides Russian strategy has become cocooned in an   latticework of   dubious interpretations, and ludicrous optimism, which may make him prone to dangerous adventures —  deeper engagement in the Syria quagmire, a wider invasion of Ukraine, or tangling directly with NATO or China. In the long run, the FSB may well be as dangerous to Putin as to the West.", "prop": 0.22541383625725914},
{"article": " (CNN) As an only child growing up in Japan, photographer Izumi Miyazaki often let her imagination roam free. Armed with her mother’s silver Pentax, the young teen developed a peculiar approach to capturing the world around her. Surreal, grotesque and often humorous, her   seem to turn ”kawaii”    the Japanese descriptor for all things cute    on its head. In one photo, she’s beheaded    her clumpy insides spilling onto a pink backdrop. In another, her signature black bob is obscured by two slices of bread.   Appreciation for Miyazaki’s   style is growing, with thousands following her Tumblr account. And she recently finished her first solo exhibition at the Wild Project Gallery in Luxembourg. Below, the Tokyo’s Musashino Art University graduate discusses her work with CNN Style. RELATED: The world’s most beautiful instagram accounts to follow. .. What was it like growing up in Japan? It’s hard to describe because I don’t have anything to compare it to. But what I believe is that young Japanese people love to be part of a group    or even be classified in a category.  Even when they want to be original and stand out from the crowd, they tend to search for a group of similar people.  Personally, I am a little bit afraid to be cataloged or categorized. That is why I always try to be myself and don’t mind being alone. But perhaps I am in a group as well, without knowing it? Does photography run in the family? Actually, no. My grandfather used to take family pictures, but they weren’t very good. My mom tried too, but she wasn’t much better. When I held the camera for the first time, it felt very natural to me.  How do your photos reflect life and culture in Japan? They probably reflect life in Japan more than I think they do. But that’s not my intention. Although, I really like food    especially Japanese food    so you might see a lot of Japanese snacks in my photos. I don’t think my pictures show my personality. Or at least, if they do, I am not conscious of it. I take   and I am my own model. And yet, I feel that this model is another person. READ: They’re alive! A warped look at Japan’s skylines, How do you usually construct the scenes in your photos? First, I imagine what I want to do. I usually come up with ideas from everyday life. When I read books, watch TV, talk with friends . .. ideas just come up.  For example, I imagined that I wanted to cut my hair with an office paper cutter (Hair Cut, 2016) and I envisioned myself standing on a rice ball (Rice Ball Mountain, 2016). I think about composition carefully too. Does Japanese culture promote or inhibit creativity?   Yes, I think Japanese culture promotes creativity. I think Japanese people yearn for Western things, which unintentionally creates this original culture that I’m really interested in. How does social media influence your work? It’s difficult for me to answer this but thanks to social media, I can see so much variety and many, many things from all over the world. It inspires me to make something. How has your photography evolved over time? I take great care of the choice and balance of colors in each picture. The main evolution is my lighting technique and the use of Photoshop. When I was starting out, I took pictures of what I saw and didn’t make any changes to them. Now I compose the entire   myself and Photoshop has become crucial for my work.  How would you describe your photography style? That’s hard . .. I don’t feel that I have a style. I try to do what I want do, when I want to do it. I don’t really have a guideline or any steps that I like to follow. It is likely that one could classify me into one kind of style or another, but I just try to work in the moment.  Your photos feel quite cinematic. Where do you find your inspiration? Yes, there is some truth in this remark. Since my pictures are set up, this undoubtedly adds a cinematographic dimension. I really love the cinema    I love films like Amélie.  I also look towards American photographer Alex Prager as inspiration because she composes all her images, staging models and creating   scenes. I also like the work of Japanese photo artist Miwa Yanagi, where all the women ironically have the same expression and seem void of personalities.  READ: Youthful and effortlessly cool    Celebrating true Parisian style, What do you hope that viewers take away from your photos? I have no special message or purpose when I take photos. I only hope that visitors approach my photography with an open mind    with as much freedom of thinking as I try to have when I create a picture. Where do you hope to be in the next five years? I hope to have a bigger house, closer to the train station! But more seriously, I don’t know at all. To be honest, I don’t have a clear picture of what I would like to be or what I would like to achieve. I guess we will see. ", "prop": 0.105858112158815},
{"article": "Madelyn Rubinstein moved to New York City from Long Island in 1985 with big dreams of making it as a professional pianist. She had a head start: a very cheap   apartment, recently vacated by her grandmother, on Central Park South. When Ms. Rubinstein took possession of it, her rent was $93. 08 a month  —   the same price that her grandmother had been paying since 1967. Several months later, Ms. Rubinstein came home one evening to find an eviction notice on her door. The building’s new owner, Donald J. Trump, wanted her out. Mr. Trump’s plan was to knock down the building and the one next door, which he also owned, and replace them with a luxury   condominium complex facing Central Park. What he got instead was a New York brawl with a group of tenants fighting to save their homes and clinging with white knuckles to some of the city’s legendary rent deals. The battle played out for years in courtrooms and the New York news media, becoming a kind of parable of the limits of 1980s capitalist ambition in the social democratic city. Looking back on the fight, on the eve of Tuesday’s New York Republican primary, one can see Mr. Trump waging a much different sort of campaign, but with many of the same tactics  —   the threats, the theatrics, the penchant for hyperbole  —   that he has deployed in his quest for the Republican presidential nomination. As far as the tenants are concerned, Mr. Trump lost that contest. “Oh, absolutely, we won,” said Ms. Rubinstein, sitting in the   apartment where she still lives. “He wanted this whole corner to be one big Trump building. ” But Mr. Trump refuses to admit defeat. “A great deal,” he said, without hesitation, when describing 100 Central Park South  —   now known as Trump Parc East  —   during a phone interview last week. “It was a long battle, but it was a successful battle. As usual, I came out on top. ” Mr. Trump paid just $13 million for 100 Central Park South and the building adjoining it, the Barbizon Plaza Hotel, in 1981. At the time, he was 35 and making bold strides to emerge from his father’s shadow. In recent years, he had built the   Trump Tower and overhauled the building near Grand Central Terminal that became the Grand Hyatt New York. This would be a no less audacious project, and on one of the city’s most desirable blocks. To realize his dream, he had to first clear out the residents of the building, a   tower with 80 apartments, some overlooking Central Park, nearly all inhabited by tenants paying well below market rates.   and   apartments occupy a kind of mythic place in New York City history. Rent protections were created to guard families from the whims of landlords and the market they still cover about one million apartments in the city. State laws limit their rent increases and guarantee tenants, and often their children and grandchildren, the right to stay. But in expensive neighborhoods, the deals can become skewed. At 100 Central Park South, for instance, there were   apartments overlooking the park with rents as low as $436 per month. Mr. Trump wanted all of the tenants out. But rather than buying them out, a common tactic, he and the management company he hired tried to get the job done free. So the battle  —   captured in numerous lawsuits, court documents and news media accounts from that time  —   began. Leaks went unfixed, tenants alleged, and broken appliances went unrepaired. Aluminum foil was placed over windows in empty apartments, giving the building a   appearance. (Mr. Trump defended the action as standard procedure for vacant units.) More dramatic were the eviction notices from Mr. Trump’s lawyers, on a variety of grounds. One tenant was told that he had not paid his rent on time. (He presented a canceled check in court to prove that he had.) Others who had done construction on their apartments, with the approval of prior landlords, were told that they had 10 days to restore them to their original conditions. Suzanne Blackmer, a   actress and one of the original Rockettes, was ordered to vacate her   unit, for which she paid $203. 59 a month, because it was not her primary residence, meaning she was not entitled to rent protections. Ms. Blackmer insisted that it was after a legal battle that lasted more than a decade, she prevailed. Mr. Trump made his opponents out to be millionaire plutocrats, “people of great wealth. ” And also whiners. “Let me tell you something about the rich,” he said in one interview in the midst of the battle. “They have a very low threshold for pain. ” Recounting the story later in his memoir “The Art of the Deal,” Mr. Trump acknowledged that he had deliberately tried to drive out tenants, but he said that most of them were exploiting an undeserved government subsidy. He recalled getting rid of a free telephone in the building’s lobby that he claimed tenants were using “to call their friends in Gstaad and St. Moritz. ” Ms. Rubinstein and two other residents from the time said they remembered only a pay phone in the building. And while its roll of renters included a successful fashion designer and an architect, it also included a number of older people living on fixed incomes. As Mr. Trump’s frustration with the tenants grew, he offered the building’s dozen or so empty units as shelters for the homeless, promising free apartments with “beautiful views. ” The city declined, questioning the wisdom of moving people into a building headed for demolition. “I actually thought it was a very generous offer,” Mr. Trump said last week. “I don’t want to see people out on the streets. ” The tenants eventually hired a lawyer, David Rozenholc, to represent them. Now a familiar nemesis to New York City developers  —   last year, he negotiated a $25 million total payout for three clients whom Tishman Speyer was trying to eject from a small apartment building in Hudson Yards  —   Mr. Rozenholc took advantage of a legal flaw in Mr. Trump’s plans to block his application to begin construction. He also sued Mr. Trump, accusing him of harassing Mr. Rozenholc’s clients. The lawsuit claimed, among other things, that the building’s superintendent had been instructed by the management to spy on tenants. Mr. Trump brought his own action against Mr. Rozenholc, a federal racketeering suit that sought $105 million in damages and found its way to The New York Post before it was filed. Mr. Rozenholc said the suit, which was dismissed, was entirely frivolous. But he offered some words for Mr. Trump that were relatively kind, given the men’s contentious history. “He knows how to negotiate, he knows how to use leverage and he’s very perceptive about his opponent’s vulnerabilities,” Mr. Rozenholc said. “It didn’t work against me, but when you deal with Putin and Iran, these could be useful qualities. ” The tenants were waging their own campaign in the news media, casting Mr. Trump as a slumlord and a bully. In 1986, after five years of fighting, Mr. Trump abandoned his plans to knock down the building. The tenants could stay in their apartments, paying their existing rents. Mr. Trump would never realize his vision for the project. But in a sense, his defeat had been a victory, as he claimed. Even as the tenants were refusing to budge, preventing any demolition or construction, the value of the property was soaring along with the rest of New York City’s real estate market in the 1980s. In the late 1990s, Mr. Trump finally converted the building into condominiums, but renters were allowed to remain. Today, some continue to rent   units for under $1, 000 a month, less than a third of what similar apartments cost. Ms. Rubinstein, who was guaranteed   rent for life, chose instead to buy at a steep discount, paying just $150, 000 for an apartment that is now worth at least $700, 000. She is also a member of the condo board, along with one of her more noteworthy neighbors, who lives on the building’s 13th floor: Mr. Trump’s son Eric.", "prop": 0.7769817803621196},
{"article": "The era of big cable sports is over. [It ended on Wednesday, April 25, 2017, when ESPN began laying off 100 writers and   radio and television talent.  The era began after 2011, ESPN’s high water mark, with the network viewed in over 100 million households. Then, resulting from a combination of   and wanton leftist propaganda disguised as sports coverage, the cable dinosaur saw its once flourishing empire reduced to a relative fiefdom. ESPN lost over twelve million subscribers since 2012, and according to some reports, 10, 000 subscribers a day. The subscriber losses led to layoffs in 2013, and again in 2015. For much of America, and certainly most on the right, the message of ESPN’s historic setback seems clear: stop bringing leftist activism into our sports escapism. Cease using sports as a Trojan horse to masquerade a social justice agenda, and maybe people will want to watch your network. But, what lesson did ESPN take from their setback? For the purposes of this discussion, it’s more important to take a look at who ESPN didn’t layoff, as opposed to who they did. According to the sports media site Awful Announcing, which kept a tracker of the ESPN layoffs throughout Wednesday, of the 60   talent and writers who publicly acknowledged being laid off before midnight central time on Wednesday, none of them, not a single one, were among the usual suspects when it comes to purveying leftist activism at ESPN. Tony Kornheiser, who once likened Tea Party Republicans to ISIS remains at ESPN. So does his     partner Michael Wilbon. Bomani Jones, who once appeared on Mike  Mike in a “Caucasians” tee shirt remains at ESPN as does Kevin Blackistone, who once ripped Michael Jordan for donating one million dollars to the police. Granted, only 60 of the reported 100 have been laid off, and some of the more liberal personalities at ESPN could very well find themselves without a job on Thursday. However, as of the time of this writing, one thing is clear: If America’s   and ratings killing of ESPN was an attempt to send the message that we wanted less politics in their sports coverage, that message fell on deaf ears. Not that anyone should shed a tear about what happened on Wednesday. ESPN losing influence and power is a great thing. Anytime the people who gave Caitlyn Jenner the Arthur Ashe Courage Award lose the ability to influence young minds, that’s a win for America. However, the fact that ESPN laid off none of their worst political offenders, clearly shows that the leftists are still very much in control in Bristol, and if that didn’t change after losing twelve million subscribers, it won’t change anytime soon. Why does that matter? ESPN may have laid off nearly half their total talent on Wednesday, but they didn’t hang the “going out of business” sign on the door either. The era of big, cable sports died Wednesday, but the era of big liberal sports will go on. ESPN is currently investing massively in their digital properties, sensing that digital and online offerings will become the wave of the future as more and more people move away from cable and traditional television. But, if the same people who turned the ESPYs into an   Amendment infomercial are still calling the shots, then ESPN’s future digital properties will represent just as big a threat to our culture as they did when they appeared on Channel 206 of your DirecTV package. In fact, if anything, ESPN will likely become more political in the future, especially after their social justice agenda was so roundly rejected by so many. Sports fans who want to watch games and debate free of political persuasion won a battle yesterday. But, the war will go on.

{"article": "While the world watches America’s Cuban exile community celebrate the death of dictator Fidel Castro, those who have governed their own countries similarly have issued official statements of condolences for the communist caudillo, describing him as a “giant” among repressive autocrats who “resisted” the beacon of freedom 90 miles to his north. [Below, five responses from autocrats around the globe to Castro’s passing:  Venezuela: Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s dictator Nicolás Maduro  —   officially losing his status as president after suppressing a constitutionally permissible recall vote petition  —   issued a statement on state radio, comparing Castro to late Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chávez, who was a close ally of the Castro regime. “Amid the pain and the memories, we will always remember aloud our Comandante Chávez,” Maduro said on Saturday. “What a deep friendship they cultivated, a friendship of struggle and values  …     two revolutions harassed by the Empire, that have thrived and must continue to thrive. ” Syria: Bashar   While Syria and Cuba have few common needs as a state, the nations had long been allies on the international stage, voting together to advance the agendas of allies like China and Cuba at the United Nations. Embattled dictator Bashar   took some time out of his Saturday to praise Castro as a “giant leader” who has “throughout the decades led the struggle of his country and people against imperialism and hegemony with all aptitude and capacity. ” “The resistance of the Cuban leader has become legend and an inspiration for all the leaders and peoples of the world,” Assad reportedly said. “The name Fidel Castro will remain etched in the minds of all generations, as an inspiration for all the peoples seeking true independence and liberation from the yoke of colonization and hegemony,” Assad reportedly said.   Russia: Vladimir Putin, Like Castro, Putin has managed to perpetuate himself in power for years, and appears to have no plans of retiring. In his statement, Putin referred to Castro’s as a “free and independent Cuba, which he and his allies built. ” Castro, he claimed, “became an influential member of the international community and became an inspiring example for many countries and nations. “Fidel Castro was a sincere and reliable friend of Russia. He made a huge input in establishment and development of the   relations, close strategic partnership in all spheres,” the Putin statement reads. “He was a strong and wise person, who always faced future with confidence. He demonstrated high ideals of a politician, citizen and patriot, who is adamant in the right course, to which he sacrificed all his life. ” China: Xi Jinping, As a Communist leader in name  —   not just in practice like Maduro or Assad  —   Xi Jinping’s praise for Fidel Castro is to be expected. Xi called Castro a “great leader” in his statement of condolences to the Cuban communists, “adding that he has made immortal historic contributions and devoted all his life to the Cuban people’s great cause of struggling for national liberation, safeguarding state sovereignty and building socialism,” according to Chinese state outlet Xinhua. “The late Cuban leader has also made immortal historic contributions to the world socialist development, Xi added,” Xinhua notes. “The death of Fidel Castro has made the Chinese people lose a close comrade and sincere friend.

{"article": "Two prominent north Texas Democrats are sounding the alarm on the threat of a   concern: voter fraud. [Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings (D) and State Representative Eric Johnson (  100) submitted a letter Thursday to Dallas County Elections Administrator Toni   after public concerns continued to mount about scores of reports involving a potential absentee voter fraud scheme.  “According to reports, dozens of voters received   ballots they never requested,” the letter states, which “suggests the possibility of a coordinated effort to benefit a candidate or candidates in the upcoming Dallas City Council elections. ” As Breitbart Texas previously reported, the episode began when West   pastor James Armstrong alerted local media and officials alike that some of his congregants came forward with evidence that absentee ballots were arriving at their respective homes without first asking for them, as Texas law requires. “It’s just a travesty that we are dealing with this,” Armstrong told NBC DFW at the time. “Seniors who have lived in this neighborhood all of their life and are now being taken advantage of. ” Another community resident, Alice Washington, 81, lodged similar complaints with the County via her niece, Barbara Roberson. “I said, ‘Would you please send me a copy of that application because I’d like to see her signature’,” Roberson told WFAA at the time. “Someone forged her signature,” said Roberson after review of the paperwork. In the week following, dozens of similar complaints have been made, according to Mayor Rawlings’ joint letter. The duo also notes a possible pattern in recent elections: What’s more startling is that this is the second time in less than a year that we have heard reports of irregularities in West Dallas. In November, media reports indicated someone fraudulently mailed ballots for dozens of elderly or dead voters. Previous Breitbart Texas coverage noted where election integrity experts explained root causes for the latest episode and steps Texas can take to fix the matter going forward: Election integrity advocates have argued that absentee ballot problems can sometimes be rooted in poor maintenance of the underlying voter records. The Public Interest Legal Foundation noted in response to the Dallas episode that Texas should consider tightening procedures for requesting absentee ballots. “As long as you have a name and address of another voter, you’re good to go   …     You don’t even need to give a birth date,” a group spokesperson told Lifezette. Analysts say that requiring absentee ballot applications to include driver’s license or other   identification numbers could cut down impersonation attempts like claimed by the Washington family. Recent fraud conspiracies prosecuted in southern Texas point to a possible example for how elderly voters are preyed upon through the mail voting system. After an unsolicited ballot arrives, an illicit     political operative would visit the recipient’s home, offering “assistance” with completing and returning the form with   candidates in mind. One recent Texas case involved a U. S. Postal Service delivery man taking bribes in trade for allowing “politiqueras” to follow his truck, indicating which homes received ballots. The mailman also allegedly took part in campaigning for local Democrat candidates while in uniform as well. Short of legislative reforms, Mayor Rawlings and Rep.

{"article": "  Donald J. Trump appears to believe he owes little to the Republican establishment donor set, a majority of whom opposed him. He also ran a campaign that challenged longstanding shibboleths of American diplomacy. Mr. Trump’s choice of ambassadors could be a sign of how serious he is about both those stances. But as his transition team begins sifting through possible choices for a dozen major embassies, the signals are unclear. Two of his three choices so far, Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa for China, and David M. Friedman for Israel, are loyalists, not big donors. The third, Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina, picked as ambassador to the United Nations, was an ardent critic of Mr. Trump. Mr. Branstad has described President Xi Jinping of China as an “old friend” Ms. Haley and Mr. Friedman have no diplomatic experience. But the nomination of Mr. Friedman, a conservative who has been deeply critical of the   lobbying group J Street, and who has vowed to move the United States Embassy to Jerusalem, has roiled large sections of the foreign policy establishment  —   just the kind of disruption Mr. Trump liked to emphasize in his campaign. So far, Mr. Friedman is the exception. As the intense jockeying for ambassadorships has begun among donors, loyalists to Mr. Trump and, in some cases, people close to his children, his advisers have potentially competing priorities. If Mr. Trump chooses Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets who is a longtime Republican donor and a friend of the   or someone like Peter S. Kalikow, the New York developer and Trump supporter, he would be following a familiar script. If he chooses someone like Jon M. Huntsman Jr. for Japan, Mr. Trump would be trying to match a Republican establishment figure with a region he is familiar with. Mr. Huntsman has served as ambassador to China and Singapore. If he goes for someone like Robert Pence, a Virginia developer who did not support Mr. Trump’s candidacy but who has been recommended by Vice   Mike Pence, it would fall more in line with his choice of Ms. Haley and of bringing outsiders into the fold. (The two Pences are not related). The expectation is that Mr. Trump will begin by rewarding supporters with appointments to Western Europe or the Caribbean, as is often the case with new administrations. But they could also include donors to his campaign or transition, people he might need again in the future. “They generally start out more political,” said Asgeir Sigfusson, the communications director for the American Foreign Service Association. “The numbers will even out. ” In previous administrations, he said, about 70 percent of nominations were foreign service professionals and 30 percent were political appointees. It remains to be seen if Mr. Trump will adhere to that breakdown, Mr. Sigfusson said. Aides to Mr. Trump declined to comment, beyond saying that discussion about candidates was in the early stages. There are some favorites among the names Mr. Trump’s advisers are batting around, however, and meetings on the subject are expected to increase in frequency starting this week. Mr. Trump’s aides are sifting through a broad list of recommendations from people involved in the transition process, including the  ’s daughter Ivanka and his    Jared Kushner. As a result, the suggestions have included people who did not immediately support the Trump ticket, such as Ronald J. Gidwitz, who backed Jeb Bush in the primaries. There have been some aspirational suggestions, such as Mr. Huntsman, who served as ambassador to China in the Obama administration, for Japan or Michèle A. Flournoy, a top Pentagon official in the Obama administration, as an ambassador to NATO. The two have deep knowledge of policy and have been spoken of favorably by Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief White House strategist. But a number of Mr. Trump’s top advisers oppose them. Then there are more personal recommendations from people involved in the transition. One was for Morris Goldfarb, the chief executive of the   Apparel Group, which had a licensing agreement for Ms. Trump’s apparel line. Another was former Gov. James Gilmore of Virginia, who has been recommended by Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, a Trump adviser. Ivana Trump, Mr. Trump’s first wife, cheekily recommended herself to The New York Post for ambassador to the Czech Republic. John Jay LaValle, chairman of the Suffolk County Republican Committee in New York and one of Mr. Trump’s few vocal defenders in the campaign’s final days, could see a plum post. And there are a raft of donors and longtime Republicans angling for appointments who could expect particularly close scrutiny by Democrats during confirmation hearings. “I think confirmation is always problematic,” said Mel Sembler, a party   appointed ambassador to Australia by the elder President George Bush and to Italy by the younger. “The first time out, it was a long and embarrassing and difficult process,” Mr. Sembler said. Old scars become new information as senators start their review, he said. Some donors could see old troubles resurface. Mr. Kalikow, the New York developer, who filed for personal bankruptcy when he owned The New York Post more than two decades ago, has been mentioned for a possible post. So has Georgette Mosbacher, a socialite whose husband, now deceased, was the focus of a lawsuit over a flawed census count in 1990. Neither Mr. Kalikow nor Ms. Mosbacher would comment for this article. Duke Buchan, major supporter of Jeb Bush and a defender of the work of Right to Rise, the “super PAC” backing that candidate, joined the Trump effort in the summer and contributed significantly to his campaign. Mr. Buchan has expressed interest in becoming ambassador to Spain, where he says he studied and where a company he once held stock in recently owned property. He also used to own shares in a company that holds military contracts, records show. Mr. Buchan, who does not know Mr. Trump well, has had blunt discussions about how to best position himself for an ambassadorship, according to people close to the transition. He did not respond to requests for comment. Fred V. Malek, a former aide to President Richard M. Nixon and to the elder President Bush, said that being a donor did not guarantee anything. “It doesn’t mean that somebody can be a   and just have an ambassadorship,” he said. “They have to have some credentials. ” At least two prospective candidates from the donor community, according to people with direct knowledge of the discussions, are likely to end up with posts. Lewis M. Eisenberg, the Republican National Committee finance chairman who raised money with Mr. Trump’s choice for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, is seen as a possible choice for Italy. Mr. Johnson, the Jets owner, is a leading choice for Britain. Joseph Forgione, who was passed over for secretary of housing and development, has support to become ambassador to the Vatican. So does William E. Simon Jr. an ally of Rudolph W. Giuliani, who recommended him. R. Nicholas Burns, an ambassador to Greece under President Bill Clinton, said that the State Department typically put forward a list of people to consider, and that incoming presidents should be aware of their options. “I think   Trump would be well advised to broaden the circle of people he consults in making these appointments,” Mr. Burns said.", "prop": 0.5060536224583498},

{"article": " On Saturday night, following the HBO premiere of Beyoncé’s second visual album, Lemonade, the world went to bed not knowing if they would ever learn the true identity of ”Becky with the good hair.”    According to a verse on Lemonade, Becky was the other woman who the love of Beyoncé’s life was cheating with. During both her solo career and her years as a member of Destiny’s Child, Beyoncé’s music has often referenced the trifling, perhaps fictional, humans who have wronged her  —   from the man who would would max out a young Bey’s card, give her bad credit, and buy her gifts with her own ends to the hater who said she couldn’t breathe without him to the man who showed his ass and became the best thing Beyoncé never had. But those songs, like many other pop songs, have always stopped short of identifying the foolish or confirming if those people even existed. Initially, it seemed that Becky and her good hair would be one of those amorphous ghosts  —   a placeholder for the wrath of Beyoncé’s fans’ ire, a cipher whose sole purpose is to be a lightning rod of anger, a universal punching bag.    But, just as Saturday night was starting to bleed into Sunday morning, something funny happened.    Becky might have revealed herself. What did Becky with the good hair do to Beyoncé?                                       Becky and her good hair are integral to Lemonade. The album’s first four songs and videos depict a howling, scalding rage, setting the bones for everything that follows. The narrative is that the love of Bey’s life  —   the implicit message is that it’s Jay Z, but more on this in a bit  —   cheated on her and lied to her, and she found out. ”You remind me of my father, a magician, able to exist in two places at once. In the tradition of men in my blood,” Bey recites during the ”Intuition” video vignette.    At the center of the maelstrom is the other woman, the mistress, the side chick. And that woman is addressed in ”Sorry,” the fourth song on the album, as ”Becky with the good hair.” Bey sings: ”He only want me when I’m not on there. He better call Becky with the good hair.” It’s a throwaway diss, and Beyoncé is actually doing ”Becky” a favor by putting her into a witness protection program of sorts. She’s not dragging Becky through the mud. She’s not making her a target of the Beyhive, Beyoncé’s loyal fanbase. But we know that she’s someone we shouldn’t like because even though she apparently has good hair (which could also be seen as a throwaway diss   a commentary on how smooth, straight hair is considered desirable and attractive) she is a person who didn’t respect Beyoncé’s marriage and caused her pain.    To be clear, Beyoncé is pretty ruthless toward Jay in the song, even if she doesn’t name him directly; she’s much more harsh to him than she is to Becky. Beyoncé isn’t just blaming Becky, but she’s also making it clear that Becky isn’t some innocent bystander. Did ”Becky with the good hair” reveal herself? In the hours following the Lemonade premiere, fashion designer Rachel Roy posted an interesting update to Instagram. Attached to a picture of herself and a friend was the caption, ”Good hair don’t care, but we will take good lighting, for selfies. or self truths, always. live in the light #nodramaqueens”:            The phrase ”Good hair don’t care” might as well have been written in fire. Roy posting that line to the internet and her thousands of followers was like a person jumping into the lion’s den, but only if said person was wearing a vest of ribeye steaks and bacon underwear. To the casual observer, Roy and Bey’s shared usage of ”good hair” might be a coincidence. But there’s much more to it than that. Who is Rachel Roy? And is she Becky? Roy is probably best known for being a fashion designer who’s made multiple appearances on Project Runway and appearances on Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Unless you’re into fashion or reality television, you probably have no idea who she is. But to faithful members of the Beyhive, Roy has been floating around in Beyoncé’s orbit as a   villain for the last couple of years.    Roy’s origin story with music’s most powerful couple begins with her stint as an intern at Jay Z’s clothing line Rocawear after she finished college (around 1996). According to Teen Vogue, she worked in every department, and eventually worked her way up to become a creative director. This plays into Roy’s role in the Great Elevator Fight of 2014, when Beyoncé’s sister Solange infamously attacked Jay Z while the two shared an elevator after the Met Ball. Make no mistake, Roy wasn’t in the elevator when everything went down. But her existence may have spurred Solange’s attack on Jay. Everyone knows what happened in the elevator. Leaked security video of the fight  —   which showed Solange attacking Jay Z  —   went viral online. And Beyoncé later addressed the incident in the remix to her song ”Flawless,” where she talks about shit going down when there’s a ”billion dollars in an elevator.” But there’s a secondary story from that same night that never received as much attention: Solange had a   with Roy before she got into that fateful elevator. At the time, US Weekly reported that Beyoncé got involved, but it wasn’t clear what was said or why the two fought. Later, The Daily News reported that Solange fought with Jay because of Roy and Jay Z’s working relationship possibly becoming more. ”Rachel is a little too close to Jay Z,” the Daily News’s source said. ”Solange doesn’t like it, and Beyoncé doesn’t like it.”    Meanwhile, Wendy Williams connected the dots and alleged that Roy and Jay may have had a sexual relationship when she was an intern at Rocawear, suggesting that something like a flirty look or a greeting that was a little too comfortable set Solange off at the Met Ball party:  Fast forward to 2016 and ”Becky with the good hair,” and this theory that Roy is Becky begins to make sense. She has pretty hair that looks nice, which she touts as her most remarkable feature. She wrote a message about said hair hours after Beyoncé’s Lemonade premiere. She used some of the same phrasing Beyoncé used to describe said hair. She has prior drama with the Knowles family. And if Lemonade is seen as Beyoncé addressing that fight and the rift with her relationship with Jay Z, then everything about Roy being ”Becky” locks into place. What’s more uncertain at this point is why the spirit moved Roy to post that Instagram picture with that caption. Was it a cry for attention? Does she have bad friends who encouraged her to do it? Is she not of sound mind? Rachel Roy feels the sting of the Beyhive Beyoncé’s Beyhive didn’t waste any time in dragging Roy. They began responding to the picture, so much that Roy flipped her Instagram account to private. Her Wikipedia page was also changed, referring to Roy as ”Rachel Roach,” or a ”Dusty Side Hoe that died under a lemonade stand.” There was even some spillover to celebrity chef Rachael Ray’s social media mentions because of their similar names and because people were not too familiar with Roy. Amidst the internet fury, Roy tweeted an odd message that appeared to be about Lemonade, her Becky connection, and her haters. Rather than directly deny having an affair with Jay Z, she instead made a declaration about how despicable bullying is:      I respect love, marriages, families and strength. What shouldn’t be tolerated by anyone, no matter what, is bullying, of any kind.\n  —   Rachel Roy (@Rachel_Roy) April 24, 2016    She’s right. The internet hate was ugly and obscene. The attacks were uncalled for. But still, Roy didn’t explain why she used the phrase ”good hair don’t care” in the first place if she didn’t want the glare of the Beyhive upon her. Before Roy’s Instagram post, no one knew who Becky was nor was anyone really thinking about Roy. And now everyone was. How much of Lemonade is autobiographical? The most shocking thing about Lemonade is how blunt and raw its songs and poetic interludes are. Beyoncé talks about her father. She talks about the love of her life. She talks about how both of those men have hurt her with their dishonesty and infidelity. There are points where the album is so unapologetically uncomfortable that it becomes this sublime piece of art. But the thing about Beyoncé is that she has never been known for being an open person. In fact, in this age of leaks and social media, she’s managed to keep everything a secret. Look at Lemonade  —   no one knew what to expect when it premiered on Saturday night after being announced just a week or so before, just like no one knew she was going to drop her Beyoncé album with no prior marketing or promotion in 2013. When it comes to media access, Bey’s reputation is that she doesn’t give many interviews. In 2015, the New York Times published an analysis of Beyoncé’s media presence (or lack of one) noting that though she was on the cover of the September issue of Vogue  —   the holy grail of magazine covers  —   she didn’t grant the magazine an interview. The New York Times reported:  At some imperceptible point around 2013 to 2014, she appears to have stopped giving    interviews. A member of her team told a reporter in May that despite numerous appearances, Beyoncé had not answered a direct question in more than a year. Her publicist declined to clarify this stance. (When Beyoncé does answer questions, it tends to be in writing or, for TV, taped.)     It’s fascinating that the biggest pop star on the planet is the most private one. It’s also incredible that Beyoncé has such a full handle on her image. Everything is seemingly on her own terms. That’s led to this idea that we never get the ”real” Beyoncé. Vulture’s Nitsuh Abebe examined this criticism in 2013, explaining that people see a machine instead of a human when they look at Beyoncé:  Here, after all, is a criticism one hears of Beyoncé qua pop star: that she is ”flawless” in an empty, dutiful way. That beneath the    performances and public togetherness, there lies a robot. Or, if not a robot, then something like the kid who’s been so pressured and trained to master a skill that he lacks any kind of feeling beyond his perfect technique —  a   imposing blank.  If you expand this theory  —   that everything Beyoncé touches is constructed by Bey and her team  —   it puts a different spin on her personal life. Everything we think we know about her life is something she wants us to know. From the sexual ecstasy  expressed in the songs on Beyoncé to the fight in the elevator to the visceral pain in Lemonade and Becky’s good hair Instagram post  —   it’s all part of her grand design. I’m not quite sure how much of that theory I buy. But if it’s true, then I’ll admire the skill needed to pull that off instead of being miffed that I fell for it. Lemonade is no exception. It’s Beyoncé’s most personal album yet. That’s why everyone was so shocked to hear the words spoken and sung about Jay and her father. But only Beyoncé knows how much of it, if any of it, is authentic.    Her version of the story is the only version of the story. And that she doesn’t owe or give anyone an explanation about which parts are real, that she doesn’t have to make her life and her art more helpful for our understanding, is much more intriguing than any side chick she’s singing about.  11 songs you didn’t know were Prince songs    ", "prop": 0.13033924613150139},

The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse is hearing evidence from men and women who say they were sexually abused when they were as young as 15, in certain divisions of the Australian defense force. This commission is focusing on alleged abuse at the naval training center HMAS Leeuwin in Western Australia and the army apprentice school Balcombe in Victoria during the 1960s, ’70s and ’80s and also among cadets with the Australian defense force since 2000. READ: Pentagon: Sexual assault cases in the military remain constant,  In total, 111 victims came forward to report abuse. More than a dozen of them will give evidence to the inquiry in Sydney, which continues until July 1.  ”On multiple occasions, I was snatched from my bed in the middle of the night by older recruits and dragged to a sports oval,” said one male witness who wasn’t named.  The witness said he was forced to rape other recruits, and was raped himself by older recruits and staff.   ”The environment made it useless to resist,” he said. ”One could stand only so much abuse before realizing that saying ’no’ was pointless. After a while compliance and getting it over and done with seemed the best solution.”  Many survivors say that when they reported the abuse, they were ignored, punished, or told it was ”a rite of passage” in their initiation period. READ: Report: Military punishes sex assault victims,  Another witness,    Graeme Frazer, told the inquiry that as a    naval recruit in 1967, he remembers being ”terrified” as he was dragged from the showers, beaten and sexually abused by three other recruits.  He said one of the attackers tried to force him to give oral sex, then they held him down while his genitals were covered with boot polish and scrubbed with a hard brush.  ”I still feel a lot of guilt and shame about the abuse,” Frazer said. ”I have suffered depression.”  The inquiry also will hear evidence from former and current staff members, and examine the handling of complaints and the responses to claims for compensation.  The inquiry is part of a   investigation into sexual abuse in the Australian military. A spokesperson for Australia’s Defense Ministry told CNN that it is ”cooperating with the Royal Commission and supports its objectives to safeguard children.

{"article": " U. S. President Donald Trump’s push to force U. S. industry to bring jobs home is opening investment avenues for Chinese companies in Mexico, an executive with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) the country’s largest lender, said on Friday. Fears of a hit to foreign investment ran high when Ford Motor Co ( ) canceled a $1. 6 billion plant in Mexico’s central state of San Luis Potosi in January.  Trump, who had railed against U. S. manufacturers investing in Mexico, hailed the decision as a major victory, but Ford put it down to declining demand for small cars. Yaogang Chen, head of ICBC’s ( )( ) Mexico unit, said U. S. industry’s loss could be China’s gain. ”If some U. S. investment projects don’t (happen) there has to be somebody to invest. . .. If Chinese companies think it is profitable, they will invest,” he said in an interview on the sidelines of a banking conference in the resort of Acapulco. In February, China’s Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group Co Ltd (JAC Motor) ( ) and Mexico’s Giant Motors, along with distributor Chori Co Ltd ( ) said they would invest over $210 million in an existing plant to build SUVs in the central state of Hidalgo. Prior to Trump’s campaign against U. S. manufacturers shipping jobs overseas, Chinese companies were making tentative inroads into Mexico. China’s BAIC Motor Corp Ltd ( ) in June 2016 started selling in Mexico its own cars imported from China and has said that it will look into building an industrial plant in Mexico to produce cars and electric vehicles. BAIC is already a client of ICBC’s in Mexico.

{"article": "New England winters are melting away.  out of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the northeastern United States will see warmer temperatures significantly faster than the rest of the planet. “I tell my students that they’re going to be able to tell their children, ‘I remember when it used to snow in Boston,’” Raymond Bradley,   of the study, and director of the Climate System Research Center at UMass,  . The study, published Jan. 11 in PLOS ONE, suggests that the Northeast will reach the Paris Agreement’s global warming threshold 20 years earlier than anywhere else in the world. The Paris pact sought to limit the rise in global temperatures to two degrees Celsius (3. 6 degrees Fahrenheit.) Average global temperature have already risen one degree since 1880, and   of that increase has taken place since 1975. The 2 degree mark is considered the point of no return for catastrophic effects of global warming. “The 2 C number is a global average, and many regions will warm more, and warm more rapidly, than the earth as a whole,”  Bradley and his   Dr. Ambarish Karmalkar, predict the Northeast will have already warmed by 3 degrees Celsius as the rest of the world approaches the 2 degrees mark. Their report follows an   which found that, in a   scenario, rising sea levels could sink 30 percent of Boston by the end of the century. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Jan. 9 that   behind 2012. “No other year had as many states breaking or close to breaking their warmest annual average temperature,” NOAA said in a statement, calling the warming “unparalleled. ” The Northeast can expect more wet winters, an increase in flooding, and many, many more   days (at least 90 a year, compared to 11.) The southwest is also expected to warm faster, while the Northwest and Great Plains will experience longer droughts and drier summers. “Policymakers need information that is useful at the local, not global scale,” Karmalkar said in the press release. But despite the agreement’s global attempt to curb temperature increase,   found that even if countries meet their pledges, a failure to cut an additional 12 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 would result in a warming between 2. 9 to 3. 4 degrees Celsius (5. 2 to 6. 1 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of this century.

Even though the Spurs only lost once at home during the regular season, and that to the   Warriors, the Thunder found a way to beat the Spurs at ATT Center twice in the span of four games. On the brink of elimination, San Antonio played Game 6 with uncharacteristic desperation. As Spurs player after Spurs player tried and failed to get into an sort of offensive rhythm, Gregg Popovich, almost universally regarded as the best head coach in the NBA, kept making increasingly inexplicable substitutions as if hoping to stumble upon a combination that would work. He did not. By   the Spurs had scored just 31 points, a   and the Thunder were clearly in command. To their credit, the Spurs didn’t relent. In fact, there was a moment in the fourth quarter where it looked like the team had at least one more miracle comeback left in them. During this manic final run, the Spurs cut the Thunder lead, which was once as large as 28 points, to 11. Thunder fans, loud and boisterous for most of the game, became increasingly quiet, all too familiar with the signs of a potential late game collapse. Then the Spurs run came to a sudden, shocking end when Serge Ibaka blocked a Duncan   one he probably would have made just a few years ago. With that one swat, it was as if all the tension in the building was released at once. San Antonio never really threatened again. If you weren’t a Thunder fan, Duncan’s failed   might have brought on an unexpected rush of sadness. It’s always a difficult to watch the greats face their basketball immortality, but, as our DJ Gallo noted, it’s downright shocking when the player in question is Duncan, who staved off   decline for such a long time that it’s become his primary characteristic. In fact, for well over a decade, the Spurs’ identity has been tied to this concept that they’re the only constant in the   basketball world. Every year, the Spurs would be in the playoffs. Duncan, Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker would be three of the most important players on the court. That era is coming to an end. Duncan and Ginobili have player options for next season and could choose to retire. Even if they decide to return, it will be to serve as role players.  Don’t think of this as a eulogy, however. The Spurs are not going into rebuilding mode. While the Spurs might finally have reached the end of one era, the next one has already begun. With Kawhi Leonard, who placed second in this year’s MVP voting, they have maybe the most dangerous   player in the league. While LaMarcus Aldridge seemed to be like a luxury item when the Spurs signed him during the offseason, it looks like he’ll be a crucial part of the next version of the Spurs. Popovich will be head coach for however long he wants to continue in that role. Unless something goes terrible awry, they should be an attractive to free agents for the foreseeable future simply because their track record of success.  But, still, even if last night didn’t mark the end of the Spurs as one of the premier teams in the league, it certainly felt like the end of something. Something very real, if not entirely explicable. For an entire generation of NBA fans, Duncan, Ginobili and Parker are the Spurs and have always been the Spurs. What could this team possibly look like without them?", "prop": 0.03420296780986354},
{"article": "   I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. Updated on April 27 at 2:05 p. m. ET, Describing the   Republican speaker of the House as a “serial child molester,” a federal judge in Chicago sentenced Dennis Hastert to 15 months in prison on Wednesday for lying to investigators and evading federal banking regulations as part of a scheme to cover up   sexual abuse. Judge Thomas Durkin also imposed two years’ supervised release, a $250, 000 fine, and attendance in a   treatment program. Hastert faced five years in prison for the charges under federal sentencing guidelines. Prosecutors had requested a maximum of six months, while the former politician’s defense team asked for probation, citing his age, 74, and health woes. Before entering politics, Hastert taught high school in Illinois and coached a wrestling team between 1965 and 1981. At least four members of the team have now accused him of sexually abusing them one of them filed a lawsuit for $1. 8 million in compensation on Monday. The court heard stunning testimony during the hearing from Scott Cross, previously known as “Individual D” in court filings, before the judge handed down his sentence. Cross testified publicly for the first time that Hastert molested him decades earlier as a teenager. “As a 17 year old boy, I was devastated,” he told the court. “I felt intense pain, shame, and guilt. ” “I don’t remember doing that, but I accept his statement,” Hastert said when asked about Cross’s allegations during Wednesday’s hearings. Scott’s brother, Tom Cross, served as the Illinois House GOP leader for 11 years and was a political protégé of Hastert during his political career. According to the Chicago Tribune, Hastert asked his former friend and ally to write a letter of support for his sentencing he received no response. Hastert has not faced criminal charges for the acts, which now fall outside the statute of limitations. None of the acts occurred during his   career in the U. S. House of Representatives. The court also heard from Jolene Burdge, whose brother, Stephen Reinboldt, had told her about repeated instances of abuse. He died of   complications in 1995. From the stand on Wednesday, she demanded Hastert admit what he had done to her brother and “tell the truth. ” Hastert addressed the court last and apologized for “mistreating athletes. ” When Durkin pointedly asked him whether he had sexually abused them, Hastert simply answered, “Yes. ” The    former politician’s downfall came not from the allegations of sexual abuse themselves, but from his efforts to cover them up: In or about 2010, according to the indictment, Hastert —  a former   teacher and coach —  met with an unnamed individual from Yorkville, Hastert’s hometown. They “discussed past misconduct by defendant against Individual A that had occurred years earlier. ” In effect, Hastert fell victim to blackmail, the indictment alleges: He “agreed to provide Individual A $3. 5 million in order to compensate for and conceal his prior misconduct against Individual A. ” (Since leaving the House, Hastert has become a highly paid lobbyist.) [  …    ] After the 2010 meeting with Individual A, Hastert allegedly began withdrawing cash from his bank accounts to pay to the individual. But federal laws require financial institutions to report transactions greater than $10, 000, and Hastert made a series of them. In April 2012, the indictment alleges, employees of Hastert’s bank questioned him about the withdrawals, and he promptly reduced his withdrawals to smaller amounts, to escape the requirement. Authorities were already watching, however, and they began investigating Hastert for structuring currency transactions to evade federal requirements —  itself a crime. Federal prosecutors indicted Hastert last May for lying to FBI agents and evading banking regulations on cash withdrawals. He pled guilty in October.             Like this?

{"article": "This is one Broadway show that’s bound to have a very large costume budget: “Cher: The Musical. ” The pop icon tweeted a few years ago that she wanted to do a show about her life. She met with veteran musical theater writer Rick Elice to discuss some ideas. All went quiet, until this week. On Thursday, Elice will present the first draft of his script to the show’s producers  —   Jeffrey Seller, riding high these days on “Hamilton,” and the fabulously named Flody Suarez, an   television producer who persuaded Cher to do the musical in the first place. “They may pack me in a van and have me carted away when they see what I’ve done with her life,” says Elice. “Or I’ll start doing what [‘Gypsy’ writer] Arthur Laurents always said about musicals, ‘They don’t get written. They get rewritten.’ ” Elice is due to present his script to Cher herself on May 20, which happens to be her 70th birthday. “I’ll be sharing with Cher, if you will,” he says. Elice is determined not to do a standard biomusical, though he’s no slouch in that department. He and writer Marshall Brickman did pretty well with “Jersey Boys,” the Four Seasons bio that’s been running at the August Wilson Theatre since 2005. The problem with Cher, Elice says, is that her “life is so wildly documented. There is not much we don’t know about her. I was not a fanatical Cher fan, but when I started working on this show, I was surprised at how much I knew. ” Sources say the musical will take audiences through Cher’s life as a child, as the wife of Sonny Bono, and as the woman who finds success  —   and legendary status  —   on her own. Three different actresses will play her at these three points in her life. All will have long legs. At one point, there was talk of Cher appearing in the show at the very end as herself today, but I’m told that’s probably not going to happen. Her life is certainly big enough for a Broadway musical. The former Cherilyn Sarkisian LaPiere was born near Los Angeles, where her mother struggled to be an actress while waiting tables (shades of “Gypsy” here, I wonder? ). The family moved around a lot, and never had much money. At one point, Cher wound up in an orphanage (“Annie”? ). From an early age, Cher knew she wanted to be famous. She was working as a backup singer in Los Angeles when she met Sonny Bono, also a struggling singer, in 1962. They clawed their way to the top, eventually creating TV’s fabulous “The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour. ” That part of the musical could have shades of “Dreamgirls” about it. After the marriage ended in a bitter 1975 divorce, Cher reinvented herself, first as a solo singer, then as an actress. Her breakthrough on that front came when she appeared on Broadway in 1982’s “Come Back to the 5 and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean. ” Mike Nichols saw her and cast her in “Silkwood,” which began the next phase of her career: movie stardom. (  fact: “Jimmy Dean” was the only time Cher appeared on Broadway. But her close friend David Geffen at one point urged her to play Grizabella in “Cats,” which he produced with the Shuberts.) “Cher: The Musical”  —   that’s the working title only, people  —   will touch on all these aspects of her life, along with her hits: “I Got You Babe,” “Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves,” “Take Me Home,” “Believe,” “If I Could Turn Back Time. ” “So far, I’ve been working on this by myself  —   well, me and iTunes,” says Elice. He put the show aside last year to take care of his husband, the great Roger Rees, who was fighting brain cancer. Rees died in July 2015. Three months later, Cher called. She suggested they start working again and invited him to spend time with her in California. Says Elice: “I thought, if Roger were here, the first thing he’d say is, ‘Get on the plane and go to Cher’s house already!’ I mean, if you’re going to rejoin the human race, why not do it with Cher?”", "prop": 0.06076908551931258},

{"article": "The   fight between Apple and the government burst into the open last week when the U. S. Federal Bureau of Investigation obtained a court order requiring Apple to write new software and take other measures to disable passcode protection and allow access to shooter Rizwan Farook’s iPhone. The clash has driven to the heart of a   debate over how much law enforcement and intelligence officials should be able to monitor digital communications. Arguing that the court should throw out the order that it issued last week, Apple said in its brief on Thursday that software was a form of protected speech, and thus the Justice Department’s demand violated the constitution. ”The government’s request here creates an unprecedented burden on Apple and violates Apple’s First Amendment rights against compelled speech,” it said. Apple also contended that the court was   its jurisdiction, noting that Congress had rejected legislation that would have required companies to do the things the government is asking Apple to do in this case. ”No court has ever authorized what the government now seeks, no law supports such unlimited and sweeping use of the judicial process, and the Constitution forbids it,” Apple said in its filing. The government argues that the All Writs Act, a broad 1789 law which enables judges to require actions necessary to enforce their own orders, compels Apple to comply with its request.  But Apple argued in its filing that prosecutors wrongly applied a key U. S. Supreme Court case, which involved a telephone company, to the San Bernardino situation. Since Apple is not a utility, and because Congress declined to force companies like Apple to build ”backdoors” into their products, Apple said it should not be forced to help the government hack into the San Bernardino iPhone. The Justice Department won the order from the federal court in Riverside, California last week, without the company present. The judge allowed Apple to respond in the brief on Thursday, and a hearing is scheduled for next month.     Some of the largest tech companies appear to be lining up behind Apple. Google and Facebook will both file briefs supporting the iPhone maker, said several sources familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly about it. Microsoft will file a     brief as well, company President Brad Smith said in congressional testimony Thursday. Twitter also said it will sign a brief in support of Apple. In a statement responding to Apple’s filing, the Justice Department said its approach to prosecuting crimes has not changed. ”The change has come in Apple’s recent decision to reverse its   cooperation in complying with All Writs Act orders,” department spokesperson Melanie Newman said. While much of Apple’s argument is that the All Writs Act does not apply, the free speech and due process claims could prove helpful if the company wants to attract the attention of the Supreme Court, said Jill Bronfman, director of the Privacy and Technology Project at University of California Hastings College of the Law. ”It always does help to mention the Constitution,” she said.  If the San Bernardino order is upheld, Apple said, it could leave individuals and business vulnerable to an unlimited array of government directives. ”Under the same legal theories advocated by the government here, the government could argue that it should be permitted to force citizens to do all manner of things ’necessary’ to assist it in enforcing the laws,” Apple said. It gave examples, ”like compelling a pharmaceutical company against its will to produce drugs needed to carry out a lethal injection in furtherance of a lawfully issued death warrant or requiring a journalist to plant a false story in order to help lure out a fugitive.” Apple also laid out the resources it believes would be necessary to comply with the government’s request, saying it would likely require a team of up to 10 Apple engineers and employees for as long as four weeks. Complying with the request would also likely lead to ”hundreds” of more demands from law enforcement, Apple said.  ”Responding to these demands would effectively require Apple to create   positions in a new ’hacking’ department to service government requests,” the company said in the filing. Earlier on Thursday, FBI Director James Comey told a congressional panel that court approval of the FBI’s request was ”unlikely to be a trailblazer” in other cases. While the case ”will be instructive for other courts,” larger policy questions about reasonable law enforcement access to encrypted data will likely need to be resolved by Congress and others, Comey said. Shares of Apple were barely changed and closed up less than 1 percent at $96. 76. Apple also raised the specter of courts ordering it to help in other cases in other ways, such as writing computer code that would turn on an iPhone microphone to help surveillance. The company also criticized the Justice Department for publicizing the order, which would normally have been filed under seal. ”This is the only case in counsel’s memory in which an FBI Director has blogged in   about pending litigation, suggesting that the government does not believe the data on the phone will yield critical evidence about other suspects,” the company said. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an interview on Wednesday with ABC News that the company was prepared to take the case to the Supreme Court if necessary. BRUSSELS EU antitrust regulators are weighing another record fine against Google over its Android mobile operating system and have set up a panel of experts to give a second opinion on the case, two people familiar with the matter said. KIEV The Ukrainian software firm used to launch last week’s global cyber attack warned on Wednesday that all computers sharing a network with its infected accounting software had been compromised by hackers.

In the journal, the      man praised   founder Osama Bin Laden, the radical   cleric Anwar   and the 2009 mass shooting at Fort Hood, Texas. “He talked about pressure cooker bombs and pipe bombs in the streets as they planned to run a mile,” McCaul said, referencing the explosion that took place Saturday at a Marine Corps charity race in Seaside Park, New Jersey. According to McCaul, Rahami stated in the journal “his guidance” came from Abu Muhammad   the chief spokesperson and propagandist for the terror group ISIS, who was killed in a US drone strike in Syria in August. “Death to the oppression,” Rahami wrote. “God willing the sound of bombs will be heard in the streets. ”  —  Jon Passantino, Bharara went on to list that evidence, which included12 fingerprints on the “undetonated bomb” on 27th Street in Chelsea, surveillance video of Rahami near the detonated 23rd Street bomb   before the explosion and video of Rahami walking with a suitcase at 27th Street, and license plate readers that showed his vehicle, which was linked to his home address, entering Manhattan through the Lincoln Tunnel two hours before the explosion and leaving Manhattan two hours after.  Bharara also said during the press conference Wednesday that a “handwritten journal was found on Rahami at the time of his arrest” which mentioned, jihad, pipe bombs, a pressure cooker bomb and the sounds of bombs heard in the street. The journal, according to Bharara, also contained “laudatory” references to   founder Osama bin Laden and Anwar   an American citizen whose speeches have been credited with inspiring domestic terrorists even years after his death by a US drone strike in Yemen.  “This weekend, as you all appreciate, the American way of life was attacked and everyday routines were shaken by explosions in Chelsea and Seaside Park,” Bharara opened the press conference by saying.  “The response to these misguided acts of terror has been classically American, and what we have come to expect in our city from New Yorkers: care for the victims, calm in the midst of chaos, and swift law enforcement action. Now, thanks to that response, Rahami will face federal terrorism charges in a court of law. ”   —  Talal Ansari, Surveillance footage obtained by the FBI shows the two men “located a piece of luggage on the sidewalk, removed an improvised explosive device from the luggage, and then left the vicinity leaving the device behind but taking the luggage,” the FBI said in a statement. The video was taken on 27th Street between 6th and 7th Avenues in Manhattan, and was taken within the same hour a bomb exploded four blocks south, on 23rd Street, injuring 29 people. “The FBI is interested in speaking to these individuals and recovering the luggage,” the agency said.  A widely circulated photo of the improvised explosive device revealed it was a pressure cooker bomb with exposed wires.   —   Talal Ansari, FBI seeks public’s help in locating two men related to   investigation https:  .  The complaint against Rahami, filed in the Southern District of New York, includes four charges: Use of weapons of mass destruction, bombing a place of public use, destruction of property by means of fire or explosive, and use of a destructive device during and in furtherance of a crime of violence. Prosecutors also charged Rahami in New Jersey Tuesday with six counts related to using weapons of mass destruction and bombs. Several of Rahami’s charges in both states carry potential life sentences.  The complaints also provide details about how Rahami allegedly bought, built, and tried to detonate the bombs. At the site of an explosion at Seaside Park in New Jersey, for example, investigators found an explosive device made of three pipe bombs. They also found a cell phone in the area that they believe was used as a timer for the bomb.  At the scene of the explosion in New York City’s Chelsea neighborhood, investigators found ball bearings and steel nuts they believe were packed into a pressure cooker bomb to make it more deadly scattered over the blast site that spanned 650 square feet. The complaint mentions two victims who were inside cars but nevertheless injured when the bomb went off. As was the case with the New Jersey explosion, investigators believe Rahami used a cellphone as a timer for the Chelsea bomb. Prosecutors believe Rahami bought bomb components, including chemicals and devices he could use as detonators, on Ebay. The complaint describes purchases going back to June 20 and continuing through August. The complaint also states that investigators searched social media accounts believed to belong to Rahami and found that he had liked videos related to jihad.  In addition, authorities recovered what they describe as Rahami’s handwritten journal. In it, Rahami allegedly praises   leader Anwar   and Fort Hood shooter Nidal Hasan. According to the complaint, his journal concludes: “Inshallah [God willing] the sounds of the bombs will be heard in the streets. Gun shots to your police. Death To Your OPPRESSION. ”  —   Jim Dalrymple II, It remains unclear what law enforcement agency has taken the lead on interrogating Rahami. The FBI did not respond to questions asking whether federal interrogators had yet gained access to the suspect.  —   Ali Watkins, “In August 2014, the FBI initiated an assessment of Ahmad Rahami based upon comments made by his father after a domestic dispute that were subsequently reported to authorities,” the FBI said in a statement sent to BuzzFeed News.  “The FBI conducted internal database reviews, interagency checks, and multiple interviews, none of which revealed ties to terrorism. ” His father, Mohammad Rahami, told the New York Times earlier on Tuesday he called authorities because his son was “doing really bad. ” “Two years ago I go to the FBI because my son was doing really bad, OK?” Mohammad Rahami said. “But they check almost two months, they say, ‘He’s OK, he’s clean, he’s not a terrorist.’ I say OK. ”  —  David Mack, On Tuesday, while speaking with reporters outside the family’s restaurant in Elizabeth, N. J. Mohammad Rahami said, “I called the FBI two years ago,” the New York Times reported. “Two years ago I go to the FBI because my son was doing really bad, OK?” Mohammad Rahami said. “But they check almost two months, they say, ‘He’s OK, he’s clean, he’s not a terrorist.’ I say OK. ” “Now they say he is a terrorist,” Rahami said. “I say OK. ” The Associated Press reported that Mohammad Rahami contacted the FBI in 2014 and told them that he believed his son was a terrorist, but later retracted the statement, according to an official. ABC News reported that in the summer of 2014 a “concerned citizen” also called police in New Jersey to report that Mohammad Rahami had said that his son may be in contact with individuals overseas who were collecting explosives. Based on this report, a “Suspicious Activity Report” was compiled on Rahami and sent to the FBI. Federal agents then interviewed Mohammad Rahami, who told the FBI that his son had traveled to Pakistan and was interacting with “bad people,” ABC News reported. The handwritten notes also referenced the 2009 Fort Hood shooting that left 13 people dead and 30 others injured, and was described to NBC News as “a hodge podge, a rambling, disconnected, choppy series of references to past events. ”    who was killed in a US drone strike in 2011 in Yemen, was a spokesman for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and editor of the terrorist group’s online magazine Inspire. In one section of Rahami’s notes, which were covered in blood and pierced by a bullet hole, the    wrote of “killing the kuffar,” or unbeliever, the New York Times reported. NBC originally said the note was found on an unexploded pressure cooker bomb left Saturday night on 27th Street in Manhattan, four blocks from where another exploded, but CNN and the Washington Post said the note was found on Rahami after his arrest Monday in Linden, New Jersey.  —  Jon Passantino, The official said authorities were working with officials in Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates to find her and question her about what she knew of her husband’s actions.  On Monday, a New Jersey lawmaker said Rahami had contacted his office when he was in Pakistan in 2014 to ask for help in securing a visa for his pregnant wife. Rep. Albio Sires said Rahami emailed his office in 2014 after his wife’s Pakistani passport expired, the Associated Press reported. Sires said he contacted the FBI about Rahami’s request, and the follow up letter his office sent to the US embassy in Pakistan, after he was named as a suspect. Bar owner who spotted Bombings suspect speaks out: It ”shocked me” https:  .  https:  .  Bains said it was raining when he saw that he thought was just a drunk man sleeping outside his bar with a hoodie pulled around his face. Around 9 a. m. Rahami was leaning against the door of the bar, which had a cracked piece of glass, so Bains suggested that he move. “I said, ‘Hey buddy, you’re going to get hurt, this door is cracked,’” Bains recalled. Rahami moved, but as he did Bains got a glimpse of his face and “was shocked” when he recognized the same person he had seen earlier on CNN’s website. Later, Bains told a friend about the man who resembled the bombing suspect.  The friend suggested contacting law enforcement, so Bains called the Linden Police Department.  A shootout ensued later Monday morning when Lindon police arrived at the scene. Bains said he saw two officers arrive, then watched as Rahami fired two shots at them. Rahami then ran, “firing in the air,” Bains said.  “The whole thing took maybe 30 seconds or less than 30 seconds,” Bains said.  Rahami and two officers were wounded in the shootout, but no one was killed. Rahami remains in custody after being hospitalized for his injuries.  Bains was praised in the aftermath for recognizing the man and alerting authorities, but told CNN instead that he simply believes “when you see something you should say something. ” “I’m not a hero,” Bains added. “I’m just a citizen doing what every citizen should do. ” Rep. Albio Sires said Rahami, a US citizen who was born in Afghanistan, emailed his office in 2014 after his wife’s Pakistani passport expired, the Associated Press reported. Rahami, who remains in custody after alleging planting bombs in New York and New Jersey and getting in a shootout with police, was charged with attempted murder and other weapons related crimes on Monday. Sires said he contacted the FBI about Rahami’s request, and the follow up letter his office sent to the US embassy in Pakistan, after he was named as a suspect. It was unclear if Rahami wife ever came to the US.  —  Jason Wells, Union County Prosecutor Grace H. Park announced the charges over the shootout that occurred on Monday morning prior to Rahami’s capture by police. Rahami is also facing two   charges over his alleged possession of a handgun. “At approximately 10:30 a. m. on Monday morning, a uniformed Linden police officer approached a man later identified as Rahami outside a bar on East Elizabeth Avenue, according to the investigation,” the prosecutor’s office said in a statement. “At that time, Rahami immediately produced a handgun and shot the officer in the torso, striking him in his protective vest. ” “Additional patrol officers responding to the scene engaged Rahami in an exchange of gunfire that ended when Rahami was shot multiple times outside of an auto repair shop on East Elizabeth Avenue, several blocks west of where he was initially approached,” the prosecutor’s office said. Bail for Rahami was set at $5. 2 million by state Superior Court Judge Regina Caulfield. Each attempted murder charge carries potential prison term of 10 to 20 years, while Rahami could also face jail terms of   years for each weapons charges.  —  David Mack, The    woman told Fox Rahami did not pay child support and was angry at Western culture. “He would speak often of Western culture and how it was different back home,” she said. “How there weren’t homosexuals in Afghanistan. “He seemed standoffish to American culture, but I never thought he would cross the line. “One time, he was watching TV with my daughter and a woman in a [military] uniform came on and he told [their daughter] ‘That’s the bad person,’” she said. Here’s everything we know so far about Rahami.  —  David Mack, “Remember that we’re less than 48 hours into a multitude of five attacks,” Burr told BuzzFeed News. “And in less than 48 hours we have somebody in custody. But 48 hours is not enough to take the media or the weapons and do the forensics on them we need to do to make that determination. ” He added that authorities also do not yet know if there was more than one person involved in the attacks, in the US or abroad.  “We won’t know until we’ve worked with the media we’ve got,” he said.  —   Emma Loop,   ", "prop": 0.3699534419344079},

Ted Cruz ( ) who led the charge against Harwood —  should be standing with Trump against Fox, on principle, instead of attacking him. And conservatives who are mocking Trump should look in the mirror and ask themselves whether they are applying a different standard to   Fox News than they do to the mainstream media. Fox News’ behavior after Trump’s withdrawal vindicates his decision. The network issued a statement that attacked Trump politically —  “We’re not sure how Iowans are going to feel about him walking away from them at the last minute” —  and accused him of “terrorizations. ” Kelly followed up with radical leftist filmmaker Michael Moore on her program for what the Washington Post called a “televised ” where Moore defended her against Trump. How hard would it have been for Fox News simply to issue a statement expressing disappointment and reiterating that the debate would proceed as planned? Instead, Fox cast aside neutrality and integrity to join the political fray. Indeed, Politico is openly wondering whether Trump walked into Fox News’ “trap. ” No news network should try to “trap” a presidential candidate, but that is what Fox News appears to have done to Trump, damning him either way. Every candidate should expect difficult questions, and no presidential candidate has the right to dictate to networks which journalists should be allowed to ask them. If it were just a matter of Trump ducking Kelly’s tough questions, he would deserve to be criticized. After all, as Trump himself once told Kelly, debating takes courage. The nation already has one president who thinks he can bully the media, and Fox News in particular. It does not need another. But Fox News’ behavior towards Trump is the kind of bias viewers have turned to Fox to avoid. We would not tolerate it from NBC or CNN —  and we should not tolerate it when Fox News sinks to —  and below —  their level.", "prop": 0.6351519776065183},
{"article": "Alice Ollstein contributed reporting. For the last few months, House GOP moderates who have been uncomfortable with their party’s Obamacare repeal bill have had the raucous complaints of House conservative hardliners about the legislation to hide behind. But that shield has fallen, the hardliners are supporting the bill, and now it’s the votes of Republicans from purple and blue districts that determine the fate of the legislation. Those moderates are squirming under the new spotlight chasing them around the Capitol as reporters feverishly construct their own whip counts. Around 20 moderates have come out against the bill, and handfuls more have retreated into the undecided column. But unlike their House Freedom Caucus counterparts  —   who relished telling anyone who would listen their demands on Obamacare repeal  —   the GOP centrists are playing coy about where they stand on the bill and what it would take to move their vote. ”I don’t want to give a full press conference. I answered your question,” Rep. Kevin Yoder ( ) told TPM Monday evening after confirming tersely that he was undecided. Rep. Darrell Issa ( ) whose district voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, smiled like a Cheshire Cat as reporters grilled him Monday evening on where he stands on the bill. “I have commented many, many times about my undecided position,” he finally said. Rep. Michael Turner ( ) would only say that he was “busy” when a reporter asked him repeatedly Monday evening about his current stance. Last week a change to the legislation, the American Health Care Act, was unveiled, allowing states to opt out of certain Affordable Care Act insurer mandates. The amendment  —   hammered out by conservative hardliner leader Rep. Mark Meadows ( ) and prominent moderate Rep. Tom MacArthur ( )  —   quickly brought most of the House Freedom Caucus on board. For moderates, whose opposition to the original bill was more under the radar, supporting the proposal would put them in violation of a key promise many Republicans made in the repeal fight: that they would preserve Obamacare’s protections for Americans with   conditions. Under the new changes, consumers living in states that opted out of the ACA mandate known as community ratings for health status could face higher premiums for any   conditions. “We’re going to allow the states to go out there and make a determination for themselves what they want to do in terms of waiving programs. What does that literally mean for people with preexisting conditions? That’s what I need to figure out for myself,” Rep. Brian Mast ( ) told reporters coming out of Tuesday morning’s conference meeting. He is now undecided on the a bill, after previously giving a stirring speech encouraging members to vote for it the night before it was pulled from the floor in March. Top Republicans have said that they are closer than ever on passing the health care bill out of the House. But to get over the finish line, they have had to engage in a new round of  . Vice President Mike Pence was at the Capitol Monday afternoon, meeting with members wavering on the bill, such as Yoder and Rep. Mario   ( ).   played it cool coming out of the meeting. Asked if he was still undecided, he said he was focusing on the appropriations bill Congress will pass this week to fund the government, and wouldn’t elaborate on what Pence said to him about health care. The position moderates are in is a tough one: oppose the bill and be blamed for getting in the way of a   promise of the GOP or support it and put yourself at political risk regardless of whether the Senate passes it. Even before the latest changes, moderates were already feeling the pressure due to the bill’s massive cuts to Medicaid and phase out of the Medicaid expansion. The way the bill restructures the ACA’s tax credits for individual insurance —  making them more generous to young people at the expense of older consumers —  also puts some members in a pinch. The current dynamics have allowed some members to assert that more changes are negotiable on the bill, despite the signal from leadership that this is the version they want to move forward. Rep. Peter King ( ) stressed Tuesday morning that he “tend[s] to vote yes” but the current language probably wasn’t final. “If they don’t have the votes, then they’ll have to make changes,” King said.", "prop": 0.7359757047164296},
{"article": " (CNN) Donald Trump’s campaign is beginning to pick apart Hillary Clinton’s new running mate, seeking to flip Tim Kaine’s image from moderate and experienced elected official to that of career politician beholden to special interests. Trump and his campaign are pouncing on the Virginia senator as an opportunity to draw a fresh contrast between Trump’s outsider brand and Clinton’s status as a   Washington insider    a contrast Trump drew successfully time and again with his GOP primary opponents. The campaign is raising everything from the gifts Kaine received during his time as Virginia’s governor to his past support for the   Partnership trade deal to label the newly formed Democratic ticket as guarantors of the ”rigged system” Trump has so often decried on the campaign trail. ”If we went to central casting for someone who gives us the clearest contrast against the   ticket, they couldn’t have picked a better person from our perspective,” a senior Trump adviser said. ”They are doubling down on the status quo. They are doubling down on the system as it currently stands.” The campaign will continue to draw that contrast in the coming days as Trump hits the campaign trail in crucial swing states such as Florida and North Carolina in addition to poking holes in Kaine’s record as governor, the adviser said. The campaign began challenging Kaine by blasting out opposition research on Saturday and will continue to knock Kaine’s record on job creation, taxes and the size of government, the adviser said. Less than two hours after Clinton announced she had picked the junior senator from Virginia, the Trump campaign pumped out highlights from a recent news report that raised the more than $160, 000 in gifts Kaine received from businesses and political donors during eight years as Virginia’s lieutenant governor and governor. ”If you think Crooked Hillary and Corrupt Kaine are going to change anything in Washington, it’s just the opposite,” Trump’s senior communications adviser Jason Miller said in a statement, revealing a new moniker for Clinton’s running mate. ”It’s only fitting that Hillary Clinton would select an ethically challenged insider like Tim Kaine who’s personally benefited from the rigged system.” Kaine spokeswoman Amy Dudley rebutted the corruption allegations, insisting Kaine ”went beyond the requirements of Virginia law, promptly disclosing any and all gifts received, including those beneath the reporting threshold.” ”All disclosure information    the vast majority of which was for   travel expenses rather than gifts    has been publicly available for years and never once raised any concerns of impropriety,” Dudley said in a statement. The Clinton campaign declined to respond to a request for comment on the Trump campaign’s allegations about Kaine. Kaine is a   figure on Capitol Hill, known for his initial skepticism of the Iran nuclear deal and his unrelenting calls for Congress to pass a new authorization of military force in the fight against ISIS    earning him the praise of some Republicans. ”Trying to count the ways I hate @timkaine,” tweeted Sen. Jeff Flake,  . ”Drawing a blank. Congrats to a good man and a good friend.” But the Trump campaign pressed forward Saturday morning, blasting out additional opposition research pressing forward with its assault on Kaine that labeled him a ”career politician” lacking a signature accomplishment as governor. Trump followed up his campaign’s messaging in a series of tweets Saturday morning that accused Kaine of being ”owned by the banks” and slammed his support for the   Partnership, which Trump has railed against during his campaign. ”Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!” Trump tweeted, despite the fact that his own running mate has also voiced support for the TPP deal. Miller, a Trump campaign spokesman, rejected the comparison between Indiana Gov. Mike Pence’s support of TPP and Kaine’s. ”Both Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine have supported bad trade deal after bad trade deal, and given their track records, nobody has confidence in their ability to negotiate for trade deals that actually help American workers.” The Trump campaign is working to upend the perception that Kaine, a moderate Democrat with decades of political experience and strong national security credentials, was a safe pick. Instead, it is using Kaine’s selection as fresh ammo to fuel its characterization of Clinton as a corrupt figure. And it’s also seizing the opportunity to try and siphon off supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders, Clinton’s chief opponent in the Democratic primary whose fighting rhetoric against special interests and free trade deals defined his campaign. Trump made his latest appeal to Sanders supporters Saturday morning, tweeting that they ”are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for.” ”Bernie supporters are outraged,” Trump tweeted. ”Bernie fought for nothing!” While Sanders and his most prominent supporters have emphatically rejected the possibility of his supporters moving to Trump’s campaign, Clinton’s pick has drawn a mixed response from progressive groups worried the Kaine pick could allow Trump to ”outflank” Clinton on trade. And Trump campaign advisers believe they can also use Kaine to highlight an enthusiasm gap between the Republican and Democratic tickets. ”They went with an insider who generates little to no enthusiasm for their base, who’s wrong on the core issues and who represents everything that is wrong with the rigged system that we see in Washington today,” the senior adviser said. The Trump campaign, sometimes known for its haphazard, disorganized messaging, is hewing closely to its talking points on the Kaine issue. ”The Kaine VP pick does nothing but hurt Hillary Clinton because it plays into the narrative that the Democrats are bought and sold by special interests,” Boris Epshteyn, a Trump campaign surrogate, said Saturday on CNN. ”Both the Clintons and Tim Kaine have a lifelong history of taking money from special interests and being bought and paid by those special interests.” ", "prop": 0.34165490096048795},
{"article": " Britain said 34   apartment blocks had failed fire safety checks carried out after the deadly Grenfell Tower blaze, including several in north London where residents were forced to evacuate amid chaotic scenes. British officials have conducted tests on some 600   buildings across England after fire ravaged the Grenfell social tower block in west London on June 14, killing at least 79 people in the capital’s most deadly blaze since World War Two. The Department for Communities said 34 apartment blocks had failed tests in 17 parts of the country, from London in the southeast to Manchester in the north and Plymouth on the southwest coast.  Prime Minister Theresa May, who was forced to apologize for the government’s initial slow response to the tragedy, said the authorities were now racing to establish what needed to be done.  ”In some cases it’s possible to take mitigating action,” she told Sky news. ”In others it’s been necessary for people to move out on a temporary basis and that is what happened in Camden last night.” Some 4, 000 residents of the Chalcots Estate in Camden, north London, were told to vacate their apartments on Friday after the Fire Brigade ruled that their blocks were unsafe.  Emerging into the streets on a hot night, residents clutched children, pets and small amounts of clothing and food to try to find a bed in a local hotel or with family or friends. Many were directed to inflatable beds laid out on the floor of the local sports hall.  ”I know it’s difficult but Grenfell changes everything,” Georgia Gould, Leader of Camden Council, said in a statement. ”I don’t believe we can take any risks with our residents’ safety.” May said the local authority would be given all the means necessary to make sure people had somewhere to stay.  Residents complained of first hearing about the evacuation from the media and getting very short notice to leave from city officials going   . Not all residents agreed to go, as they felt the evacuation was an  . PUBLIC ANGER ”It was farcical communication,”    Daniel Tackaberry told Reuters outside a nearby sports center where the local council had laid out air beds. ”You don’t get everyone to leave this quickly.” Several local councils said they were removing cladding from the facades of buildings that had failed the tests. In Camden, however, the London Fire Brigade found a number of faults, including concern about cladding, faulty fire doors and holes in compartment walls that could help a fire to spread.      Gould, the Camden council’s leader, said it would take up to four weeks to repair the blocks that were evacuated.  Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said the government was working with local authorities and fire services to address any problems that had been found.  ”We are now rapidly identifying buildings of concern: samples are being tested very quickly; fire inspectors are checking the safety of the buildings as a whole; and we have issued interim safety guidance,” he said.  Police investigating the cause of the   Grenfell Tower blaze have said the fire started in a fridge but spread rapidly due to external cladding on the building, trapping residents in their beds as they slept.  The cladding has since failed all safety checks and prompted a nationwide review of the materials used on everything from hospitals to hotels and apartment blocks. The fire has become a flashpoint for public anger at the record of May’s Conservative Party in government following cuts to local authority budgets designed to lower the national deficit. Grenfell Tower is located in Kensington, one of the richest boroughs in Europe.  Battling to save her position after losing her majority in a June 8 election, May has promised to do everything she can to protect those residents who survived the fire and to improve the quality and safety of public housing in Britain. British police have said they are considering bringing manslaughter charges over the Grenfell fire.

[“So the reality is clear: America is stronger because of the Affordable Care Act,” he wrote in a statement over 600 words long.  Obama painted his bill as the culmination of progressive history, citing leaders of both parties since former President Theodore Roosevelt fighting for the cause of health care. “[U]ltimately, after a century of talk, decades of trying, and a year of bipartisan debate, our generation was the one that succeeded,” he wrote. “We finally declared that in America, health care is not a privilege for a few, but a right for everybody. ” The former president repeated many of the selling points he used seven years ago, arguing that thanks to his bill more Americans were insured and enjoyed the benefits of health insurance. Obama specifically disputed Speaker Paul Ryan’s claim that Obamacare was in a “death spiral” even though he admitted that some premiums went up instead of down, he argued that the “vast majority” of plans did not experience premium hikes. Read the full  statement below: Statement from President Barack Obama On the 7th Anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, When I took office, millions of Americans were locked out of our health care system. So, just as leaders in both parties had tried to do since the days of Teddy Roosevelt, we took up the cause of health reform. It was a long battle, carried out in Congressional hearings and in the public square for more than a year. But ultimately, after a century of talk, decades of trying, and a year of bipartisan debate, our generation was the one that succeeded. We finally declared that in America, health care is not a privilege for a few, but a right for everybody. The result was the Affordable Care Act, which I signed into law seven years ago today. Thanks to this law, more than twenty million Americans have gained the security and peace of mind of health insurance. Thanks to this law, more than ninety percent of Americans are insured  —   the highest rate in our history. Thanks to this law, the days when women could be charged more than men and Americans with   conditions could be denied coverage altogether are relics of the past. Seniors have bigger discounts on their prescription drugs. Young people can stay on their parents’ plans until they turn 26 years old. And Americans who already had insurance received an upgrade as well  —   from free preventive care, like mammograms and vaccines, to improvements in the quality of care in hospitals that has averted nearly 100, 000 deaths so far. All of that is thanks to the Affordable Care Act. And all the while, since the law passed, the pace of health care inflation has slowed dramatically. Prices are still rising, just as they have every year for decades  —   but under this law, they’ve been rising at the slowest rate in fifty years. Families who get coverage through their employer are paying, on average, thousands of dollars less per year than if costs kept rising as fast as they were before the law. And reality continues to discredit the false claim that this law is in a “death spiral,” because while it’s true that some premiums have risen, the vast majority of Marketplace enrollees have experienced no average premium hike at all. And so long as the law is properly administered, this market will remain stable. Likewise, this law is no “” because America’s businesses went on a   streak of job growth in the seven years since I signed it. So the reality is clear: America is stronger because of the Affordable Care Act. There will always be work to do to reduce costs, stabilize markets, improve quality, and help the millions of Americans who remain uninsured in states that have so far refused to expand Medicaid. I’ve always said we should build on this law, just as Americans of both parties worked to improve Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid over the years. So if Republicans are serious about lowering costs while expanding coverage to those who need it, and if they’re prepared to work with Democrats and objective evaluators in finding solutions that accomplish those goals  —   that’s something we all should welcome. But we should start from the baseline that any changes will make our health care system better, not worse for hardworking Americans. That should always be our priority. The Affordable Care Act is law only because millions of Americans mobilized, and organized, and decided that this fight was about more than health care  —   it was about the character of our country. It was about whether the wealthiest nation on Earth would make sure that neither illness nor twist of fate would rob us of everything we’ve worked so hard to build. It was about whether we look out for one another, as neighbors, and fellow citizens, who care about each other’s success. This fight is still about all that today. And Americans who love their country still have the power to change it.", "prop": 0.5051915181527555},

[McMaster was not one of the top candidates suggested by administration sources after President Trump’s first choice, retired Vice Admiral Robert Harward, declined the position. Over the weekend, President Trump began interviewing three new candidates, along with the current temporary occupant of the position, retired General Keith Kellogg. McMaster was one of the three, along with former U. N. Ambassador John Bolton and West Point superintendent Lt. Gen. Robert Caslen.  According to the White House announcement, Kellogg will continue serving under McMaster as chief of staff for the National Security Council. Thomas Ricks at Foreign Policy predicted McMaster would be Trump’s choice for National Security Adviser on Monday morning, describing him as “smart, energetic, and tough. ” “He has good combat experience, he was a good trainer, and he led the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment well in his deployment to Iraq, most notably in pacifying Tell Afar, to the west of Mosul,” Ricks wrote, adding that McMaster was supported to a “surprising degree” by people who had worked for him in the past. McMaster is the author of a   book on Vietnam, Dereliction of Duty: Johnson, McNamara, the Joint Chief of Staff, and the Lies That Led to Vietnam. The book strongly argues that military leadership should be willing to stand up to civilian political leaders when war is not waged successfully, and also criticizes   military leadership for becoming distracted by bureaucratic infighting. McMaster’s leadership at the famed Battle of 73 Easting in Operation Desert Storm was an important part of the U. S. military’s resurgence, poetically described as “exorcising the ghosts of Vietnam” at the time. In that battle, a vastly outnumbered American unit defeated Iraqi forces with superior tactics, coordination, and technology, without suffering a single casualty. Last February, McMaster wrote an extensive account of the battle, and the lessons it provides for future conflict, for The National Interest. He is noted as an advocate of both strong conventional military forces and   capability. Concerned by cuts to both manpower and equipment modernization, he warned the Senate last year that “we are outranged and outgunned by many potential adversaries  …     our Army in the future risks being too small to secure the nation. ” One of the lessons he recommends learning from the Battle of 73 Easting, a   on, is that American forces may never again have such a pronounced technological advantage over enemy ground forces. One of the adversaries McMaster particularly worries about is Russia. Defense One reported in May 2016 that he believes the Ukraine conflict has “revealed that the Russians have superior artillery firepower, better combat vehicles, and have learned sophisticated use of UAVs for tactical effect. ” McMaster feared American military planners have invested too much effort in “winning   missile duels,” proclaiming such tactics of limited use against the “dispersion, concealment, intermingling with civilian populations  …     the ability to disrupt our network strike capability, precision navigation and timing capabilities” demonstrated by Russian forces in Ukraine. He was also concerned about Russia’s advantages in battlefield artillery. He was also concerned about Russia’s advantages in battlefield artillery, including their use of cluster munitions, thermobaric warheads, and heavy use of electronic warfare, citing reports of Russia’s astonishing effectiveness at shutting down Ukranian tactical radios, drones, and even the electrical fuses on their artillery shells. Even the vaunted American technological edge in air supremacy, tanks, and armored fighting vehicles has dangerously eroded, in McMaster’s estimation.", "prop": 0.7504157285863278},
{"article": "In San Francisco, a young engineer hopes to “optimise” his life through sensors that track his heart rate, respiration and sleep cycle. In Copenhagen, a bus running two minutes behind schedule transmits its location and passenger count to the municipal traffic signal network, which extends the time of the green light at each of the next three intersections long enough for its driver to make up some time. In Davao City in the Philippines, an unsecured webcam overlooks the storeroom of a fast food stand, allowing anyone to peer in on all its comings and goings. What links these wildly different circumstances is a vision of connected devices now being sold to us as the “internet of things”. The technologist Mike Kuniavsky, a pioneer of this idea, characterises it as a state of being in which “computation and data communication [are] embedded in, and distributed through, our entire environment”. I prefer to see it for what it is: the colonisation of everyday life by information processing. Though it can often feel as if this colonisation proceeds of its own momentum, distinct ambitions are being served wherever and however the internet of things appears. The internet of things isn’t a single technology. About all that connects the various devices, services, vendors and efforts involved is the end goal they serve: capturing data that can then be used to measure and control the world around us. Whenever a project has such imperial designs on our everyday lives, it is vital that we ask just what ideas underpin it and whose interests it serves. Although the internet of things retains a certain sprawling and formless quality, we can get a far more concrete sense of what it involves by looking at how it appears at each of three scales: that of our bodies (where the effort is referred to as the “quantified self”) our homes (“the smart home”) and our public spaces (“the smart city”). Each of these examples illuminates a different aspect of the challenge presented to us by the internet of things, and each has something distinct to teach us. At the most intimate scale, the internet of things is visible in the form of wearable biometric sensors. The simplest of these are little more than networked digital pedometers, which count steps, measure the distance a person has traversed, and furnish an estimate of the calories burned in the course of this activity. More elaborate models measure heart rate, breathing, skin temperature and even perspiration. If wearable biometric devices such as Fitbits and Apple Watches are, in theory, aimed at rigorous   the colonisation of the domestic environment by similarly networked products and services is intended to deliver a very different experience: convenience. The aim of such “smart home” efforts is to   the process of reflection that stands between having a desire and fulfilling that desire by buying something. Right now, the perfect example of this is a gadget being sold by Amazon, known as the Dash Button. Many    devices are little more than some conventional object with networked connectivity tacked on. The Dash Button is the precise opposite, a thing in the world that could not have existed without the internet.

To use Dash Button, simply download the Amazon app from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Then, sign into your Amazon Prime account, connect Dash Button to   and select the product you want to reorder. Once connected, a single press on Dash Button automatically places your order. ” In other words:   electronic devices, each dedicated to an individual branded item, that you press when you’re running low. Pressing a Dash Button specific to your preferred pet food, washing powder or bottled water automatically composes an order request to Amazon for that one product. I don’t for a second want to downplay the value of such a product for people who have ageing parents to look after, or kids to drop off at daycare, or for whom simply getting in the car to pick up some cat food may take an hour or more out of their day. But the benefit to the individual customer is tiny compared with what Amazon gains. Sure, you never run out of cat food. But Amazon gets data on the time and place of your need, as well as its frequency and intensity, and that data has value. It is an asset, and you can be sure that Amazon will exploit it in every way its terms and conditions permit  —   including by using it to develop behavioural models that map our desires in high resolution, so as to target them with even greater efficiency in the future. Again, the aim of devices such as the Dash Button is to permit the user to accomplish commercial transactions with as little conscious thought as possible  —   not even the few moments it takes to tap out commands on the touchscreen of a phone or tablet. The data on what the industry calls “conversion” is as clear as it is unremitting: with every box to tick or form to fill, the percentage of users that make it all the way to checkout tumbles. The fewer steps there are in a transaction, the more likely people are to spend their money. Manufacturers, enticed by the revenue potential of conquering the domestic environment, keep trying to eliminate these steps, in the hope that one of their connected products will become as essential to everyday life as the smartphone. The recent industry push toward the “smart home” is simply the latest version of this.  For the moment, this strategy is centred on   smart speakers, a first generation of which have now reached the market. These products include the Amazon Echo and Google Home, each of which is supposed to function as the command hub of a connected domestic environment. Amazon’s Echo is a simple cylinder, while the Google Home is a bevelled ovoid. But the physical form of such speakers is all but irrelevant, as their primary job is to function as a branded “virtual assistant” providing a simple, integrated way to access the numerous digital controls scattered throughout the contemporary home  —   from lighting and entertainment to security, heating, cooling and ventilation systems.  Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple each offer their own such assistant, based on   speech recognition. Most are given female names, voices and personalities, presumably based on research indicating that users of all genders prefer to interact with women. Apple’s is called Siri and will, according to reports, soon be getting its own device, Amazon’s Alexa, and Microsoft’s Cortana, while one simply addresses Google’s Home offering as “Google. ” At first, such devices seem harmless enough. They sit patiently and quietly at the periphery of our awareness, and we only speak to them when we need them. But when we consider them more carefully, a more problematic picture emerges. This is how Google’s assistant works: you mention to it that you’re in the mood for Italian food, and then, in the words of one New York Times article, it “will then respond with some suggestions for tables to reserve at Italian restaurants using, for example, the OpenTable app”. This example shows that though the choices these assistants offer us are presented as neutral, they are based on numerous inbuilt assumptions that many of us would question if we were to truly scrutinise them. Ask restaurateurs and    workers what they think of OpenTable, for example, and you will swiftly learn that one person’s convenience is another’s accelerated pace of work, or worse. You’ll learn that restaurants offering reservations via the service are, according to the website Serious Eats, “required to use the company’s proprietary   system, which means leasing hardware and using   software” and that OpenTable retains ownership of all the data generated in this way. You’ll also learn that OpenTable takes a cut on reservations per seated diner, which obviously adds up to a significant amount on a busy night. Conscientious diners have therefore been known to bypass the ostensible convenience of OpenTable, and make whatever reservations they have to by phone. By contrast, Google Home’s frictionless default to making reservations via OpenTable normalises the choice to use that service. This is not accidental. It reflects the largely preconscious valuations, priorities and internalised beliefs of the people who devised Google Home. As throughout the industry, that is a remarkably homogeneous cohort of young designers and engineers. But more important than the degree of similarity they bear to one another is how different they are from everyone else.    devices are generally conceived by people who have completely assimilated services such as Uber, Airbnb and Apple Pay into their daily lives, at a time when figures from the Washington   Pew Research Center suggest that a significant percentage of the population has never used or even heard of them. For the people who design these products, these services are normal, and so, over time, they become normalised for everyone else. There are other challenges presented by this way of interacting with networked information. It’s difficult, for example, for a user to determine whether the options they are being offered by a virtual assistant result from what the industry calls an “organic” return  —   something that legitimately came up as the result of a search process  —   or from paid placement. But the main problem with the virtual assistant is that it fosters an approach to the world that is literally thoughtless, leaving users disinclined to sit out any prolonged frustration of desire, and ever less critical about the processes that result in gratification. Virtual assistants are listening to everything that transpires in their presence, and are doing so at all times. As   interfaces, they must be constantly attentive in order to detect when the “wake word” that rouses them is spoken. In this way, they are able to harvest data that might be used to refine targeted advertising, or for other commercial purposes that are only disclosed deep in the terms and conditions that govern their use. The logic operating here is that of preemptive capture: the notion that companies such as Amazon and Google might as well trawl up everything they can, because no one knows what value might be derived from it in the future. This leads to situations that might be comical, were it not for what they imply about the networking of our domestic environments. These stories circulate as cautionary tales: one of the   was the time the US National Public Radio network aired a story about the Amazon Echo, and various cues spoken on the broadcast were interpreted as commands by Echos belonging to members of the audience, causing domestic chaos. Put aside for one moment the question of disproportionate benefit  —   the idea that you as the user derive a little convenience from your embrace of a virtual assistant, while its provider gets everything  —   all the data about your life and all its value. Let’s simply consider what gets lost in the ideology of convenience that underlies this conception of the internet of things. Are the constraints presented to us by life in the   world really so onerous? Is it really so difficult to wait until you get home before you preheat the oven? And is it worth giving away so much, just to be able to do so remotely? Most of us are by now aware that our mobile phones are constantly harvesting information about our whereabouts and activities. But we tend to be relatively ignorant of the degree to which the contemporary streetscape has also been enabled to collect information. This development is often called the “smart city”. If the ambition beneath the instrumentation of the body is ostensible   and that of the home is convenience, the ambition at the heart of the smart city is nothing other than control  —   the desire to achieve a more efficient use of space, energy and other resources. A broad range of networked   devices are increasingly being deployed in public space, including CCTV cameras advertisements and vending machines equipped with biometric sensors and the indoor micropositioning systems known as “beacons” that, when combined with a smartphone app, send signals providing information about nearby products and services. The picture we are left with is that of our surroundings furiously vacuuming up information, every square metre of seemingly banal pavement yielding so much data about its uses and its users that nobody yet knows what to do with it all. And it is at this scale of activity that the guiding ideology of the internet of things comes into clearest focus. The strongest and most explicit articulation of this ideology in the definition of a smart city has been offered by the house journal of the engineering company Siemens: “Several decades from now, cities will have countless autonomous, intelligently functioning IT systems that will have perfect knowledge of users’ habits and energy consumption, and provide optimum service . .. The goal of such a city is to optimally regulate and control resources by means of autonomous IT systems. ” There is a clear philosophical position, even a worldview, behind all of this: that the world is in principle perfectly knowable, its contents enumerable and their relations capable of being meaningfully encoded in a technical system, without bias or distortion. As applied to the affairs of cities, this is effectively an argument that there is one and only one correct solution to each identified need that this solution can be arrived at algorithmically, via the operations of a technical system furnished with the proper inputs and that this solution is something that can be encoded in public policy, without distortion. (Left unstated, but strongly implicit, is the presumption that whatever policies are arrived at in this way will be applied transparently, dispassionately and in a manner free from politics.) Every aspect of this argument is questionable. Perhaps most obviously, the claim that anything at all is perfectly knowable is perverse. However thoroughly sensors might be deployed in a city, they will only ever capture what is amenable to being captured. In other words, they will not be able to pick up every single piece of information necessary to the formulation of sound civic policy. Other,    distortions inevitably colour the data collected. For instance, people may consciously adapt to produce metrics favourable to them. A police officer under pressure to “make quota” may focus on infractions that she would ordinarily overlook, while conversely, her precinct commander, under pressure to present the city as   may downwardly classify a felony assault as a simple misdemeanour. This is the phenomenon known to viewers of The Wire as “juking the stats,” and it is particularly likely to occur when financial or other incentives depend on achieving a performance threshold. There is also the question of interpretation. Advocates of smart cities often seem to proceed as if it is   that each of our acts has a single, salient meaning, which can be recognised, made sense of and acted upon remotely by an automated system, without any possibility of error. The most prominent advocates of this approach appear to believe that no particular act of interpretation is involved in making use of any data retrieved from the world in this way. But data is never “just” data, and to assert otherwise is to lend inherently political and interested decisions an unmerited gloss of scientific objectivity. The truth is that data is easily skewed, depending on how it is collected. Different values for air pollution in a given location can be produced by varying the height at which a sensor is mounted by a few metres. Perceptions of risk in a neighbourhood can be transformed by slightly altering the taxonomy used to classify reported crimes. And anyone who has ever worked in opinion polling knows how sensitive the results are to the precise wording of a survey. The bold claim of “perfect” knowledge appears incompatible with the messy reality of all known   systems, the human individuals and institutions that make use of them and, more broadly, with the world as we experience it. In fact, it is astonishing that any experienced engineer would ever be so unwary as to claim perfection on behalf of any computational system, no matter how powerful. The notion that there is one and only one solution to urban problems is also deeply puzzling. Cities are made up of individuals and communities who often have competing preferences, and it is impossible to fully satisfy all of them at the same time. That such a solution, if it even existed, could be arrived at algorithmically is also implausible. Assume, for the sake of argument, that there did exist a master formula capable of balancing the needs of all of a city’s competing constituencies. It certainly would be convenient if this golden mean could be determined automatically and consistently. But the wholesale surrender of municipal management to an algorithmic toolset seems to place an undue amount of trust in the party responsible for authoring the algorithm. If the formulas behind this vision of future cities turn out to be anything like the ones used in the current generation of computational models,   decisions will hinge on the interaction of poorly defined and subjective values. The output generated by such a procedure may turn on   abstractions, in which complex circumstances resistant to direct measurement are reduced to more easily determined proxy values: average walking speed stands in for the “pace” of urban life, while the number of patent applications constitutes an index of “innovation” and so on. Quite simply, we need to understand that creating an algorithm intended to guide the distribution of civic resources is itself a political act. And, at least for now, nowhere in the current   literature is there any suggestion that either algorithms or their designers would be subject to the ordinary processes of democratic accountability. And finally, it is difficult to believe that any such findings would ever be translated into public policy in a manner free from politics. Policy recommendations derived from computational models are only rarely applied to questions as politically sensitive as resource allocation without some intermediate tuning taking place. Inconvenient results may be suppressed, arbitrarily overridden by more heavily weighted decision factors, or simply ignored. As matters now stand, the claim of perfect competence that is implicit in most   rhetoric is incommensurate with everything we know about the way technical systems work. It also flies in the face of everything we know about how cities work. The architects of the smart city have failed to reckon with the reality of power, and the ability of elites to suppress policy directions that don’t serve their interests. At best, the technocratic notion that the analysis of   data would ever be permitted to drive municipal policy is naive. At worst, though, it ignores the lessons of history. So, yes: the internet of things presents many new possibilities, and it would be foolish to dismiss those possibilities out of hand. But we would also be wise to approach the entire domain with scepticism, and in particular to resist the attempts of companies to gather ever more data about our lives  —   no matter how much ease, convenience and   we are told they are offering us.

{"article": " “A little learning is a dangerous thing,” wrote the poet Alexander Pope. Three centuries later, Pope’s aphorism perfectly  —   and dangerously  —   describes President Trump’s understanding of history as a   clash of civilizations in which “the West” can triumph by imposing its will.  The speech Trump delivered Thursday in Warsaw’s Krasinski Square might have been appropriate when Britannia ruled the waves and Europe’s great powers held dominion over “lesser” peoples around the globe. It had nothing useful to say about today’s interconnected world in which goods, people and ideas have contempt for borders.  “The fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive,” the president said. “Do we have the confidence in our values to defend them at any cost? Do we have enough respect for our citizens to protect our borders? Do we have the desire and the courage to preserve our civilization in the face of those who would subvert and destroy it?” Trump added what he probably thought of as a Churchillian flourish: “I declare today for the world to hear that the West will never, ever be broken. Our values will prevail. Our people will thrive. And our civilization will triumph. ” Triumph over whom? Trump mentioned “radical Islamic terrorism” as one of the enemies posing “dire threats to our security and to our way of life,” but he didn’t stop there. He went on to add Russia and  —   weirdly  —   “the steady creep of government bureaucracy” to the list. It is appalling that the president would describe patriotic public servants as a kind of fifth column that “drains the vitality and wealth of the people,” and I guess some precious bodily fluids as well. But what does Trump mean when he speaks of “the West” and its civilization? “Americans, Poles and the nations of Europe value individual freedom and sovereignty,” he said. “We must work together to confront forces, whether they come from inside or out, from the South or the East, that threaten over time to undermine these values and to erase the bonds of culture, faith and tradition that make us who we are. . . . We write symphonies. We pursue innovation. We celebrate our ancient heroes, embrace our timeless traditions and customs, and always seek to explore and discover   frontiers. ” That’s what I mean about a little learning. If the president read a few history books, he’d know that for most of the past 2, 000 years, China and India were the world’s leading economic powers and Europe was a relatively primitive backwater. He’d know that Europe rose to dominance not by erecting walls but by opening itself to the rest of the world  —   its resources, products and people. There is nothing pure about Western civilization. Its ability to absorb and incorporate outside influences has proved a great strength, not a weakness. Imagine Italy without tomato sauce, a gift from the New World  —   or the United States without the   companies founded by immigrants, gifts from the Old. Of course Trump is right to call for a united front against terrorism. But the solution, in a globalized world, cannot be to hunker behind walls, however big and beautiful those walls might be. Industrial supply chains cross borders and span oceans. Words and images flash around the globe at the speed of light. Global issues, such as nuclear proliferation and climate change, demand global solutions. Like it or not, we are all in this together. The correct response to the terrorism threat, which is real, is to isolate it as an abomination that is as much a grievous insult to Islam as to any other faith  —   and that has taken the lives of far more Muslims than  . The wrong response is to posit that “the West” is besieged by, and therefore at war with, a hostile civilization. That’s a fight in which everyone loses. Trump did finally make clear that the United States remains fully committed to Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which states that an attack on one member of the alliance is tantamount to an attack on all. He was tougher on Russia than in the past, and he cited “propaganda, financial crimes and cyberwarfare” as “new forms of aggression” that must be countered.  But viewing the fight against terrorism as some kind of civilizational Armageddon is wrong. Trump seems to view himself as the West’s defender against 1. 6 billion Muslims, almost all of whom want only to live in peace. We need a capable president, not a crusader in chief.

{"article": "   Step inside any   math class in the United States, and chances are you’ll find students staring down at their Texas Instrument calculators, nimbly typing commands into those $100 pocket computers. Calculators are so commonplace in modern American education that a   or   can be found stashed away in many homes, mementos from taking the SAT or computing integrals on the Advanced Placement calculus exam. Still, college professors remain divided on the use of calculators in their classes. When I took my freshman math courses at McGill University in Montreal last school year, I had to revert back to pencil and paper, clumsily lining up columns to do addition and   problems at my professor’s request. This isn’t an unusual predicament: According to a 2010 national survey by the Mathematical Association of America, nearly half of Calculus 1 college instructors prohibit students from using graphing calculators on exams. The debate over the use of calculators in math classrooms has ensued for more than four decades —  nearly as long as the contemporary calculator has been around. Although the abacus has been in use since the time of the Sumerians and Ancient Egyptians, it wasn’t until 1958 when the Texas Instrument engineer Jack Kilby invented the integrated circuit, which paved the way for the cheap and compact computer chips used in most electronic devices today. (Kilby later won the Nobel Prize in physics.) A decade later, calculators would no longer be stored in gigantic cabinets with a price tag of over $700, 000 they would substantially diminish in size and gradually become more affordable. Today, prices for graphing calculators hover around $80. By the mid 1970s, 11 percent of Americans owned a calculator.   calculators —  those that only perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division —  gradually entered the classrooms, dividing educators and parents alike. Debates over the role of calculators in the classroom quickly emerged, and arguments for and against their use have hardly changed since then. Proponents of the calculator argued that machines could help students make sense of abstract mathematical notations through   problems, making math fun and interesting. Opponents worried that students would become   on calculators, losing the ability to do simple arithmetic operations and exercise a solid sense of numbers. In 1986, Connecticut became the first state to mandate the use of calculators on state tests, signaling the beginning of a   generation. But the most consequential move came three years later from the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) which advocated for the use of calculators from kindergarten through grade 12. The guidelines set by the NCTM were soon adopted into many local and state curricula. In 1994, the College Board made substantial changes to the SAT’s math section to allow the use of calculators. The 1995 Advanced Placement calculus exams were the first to require the use of graphing calculators, a powerful electronic aid that is still used in most   math classes today. For W. Stephen Wilson, a math and education professor at Johns Hopkins University, using a calculator is akin to relying on a crutch when one doesn’t have a bad leg. “I have not yet encountered a mathematics concept that required technology to either teach it or assess it. The concepts and skills we teach are so fundamental that technology is not needed to either elucidate them or enhance them. There might be teachers who can figure out a way to enhance learning with the use of technology, but it’s absolutely unnecessary,” Wilson wrote in the journal Education Studies in Mathematics. Proponents of using technology in classrooms argue that graphing calculators, particularly those equipped with programs that can compute algebraic symbols, would reduce the need for students to memorize formulas and perform   computations. But Wilson fears that students who depend on technology will fail to understand the importance of mathematical algorithms. Yes, a calculator could effortlessly churn out the derivative of( )8, but would students understand how to find the answer using the fundamental theorem of calculus or the definition of the derivative? The idea, Wilson says, is not to have students mindlessly perform mechanical operations, but for students at all levels to apply linear thinking in understanding the beauty of efficient algorithms. If a student can’t master long division, how can she grasp derivatives and integrals? Wilson says he has some evidence for his claims. He gave his Calculus 3 college students a     arithmetic test (can you multiply 5. 78 by 0. 39 without pulling out your smartphone?) and divided the them into two groups: those who scored an eight or above on the test and those who didn’t. By the end of the course, Wilson compared the two groups with their performance on the final exam. Most students who scored in the top 25th percentile on the final also received an eight or above on the arithmetic test. Students at the bottom 25th percentile were twice as likely to score less than eight points on the arithmetic test, demonstrating much weaker computation skills when compared to other quartiles. It’s worth noting that calculators are also more likely to be barred in math exams at research universities than at   colleges and regional public universities. Out of the 50 national universities ranked at the top by U. S. News and World Report, only four schools had policies allowing electronic devices on Calculus 1 exams. One explanation is that selective institutions are less likely to offer remedial math courses and generally accept students who possess a strong math background. Why aren’t high schools taking their cue from math professors at Harvard and MIT? Because most college students won’t major in STEM subjects and won’t need advanced math knowledge for much of their work. Dan Kennedy, a   teacher at Baylor School, argues that to set a reasonable expectation for all students, calculators should be used because many   problems cannot be solved without technology. Students, he says, would be better served by learning probability, statistics, computer literacy, financial mathematics, and matrix algebra —  the kind of math that requires the use of graphing calculators —  not the kind of theoretical math that dominates math competitions. David Bressoud, a math professor at Macalester College in Minnesota, has a different theory: He thinks that large research universities typically ban calculators because the devices are essentially obsolete there. “The larger universities have traditionally had   resources, [and now] it is easier to expect that all students have access to a computer,” Bressoud said. Computers, Bressoud says, are a much better tool for teaching calculus because they are more flexible and faster than calculators. At Macalester,   calculus is known as “Applied Multivariable Calculus 1. ” Computers are heavily encouraged in class, and professors aren’t slowly chalking away proofs and theorems on the blackboard. Unlike those at traditional college math classes, Macalester professors take the word “applied” seriously: A lecture on functions, for example, is demonstrated using the Body Mass Index, a function of height and weight used to determine whether a person is obese. Students in their first year of calculus also learn differential equations, a topic that is generally covered only when students have three semesters’ worth of calculus under their belts. The aim is that, by introducing differential equations early on, students understand how mathematical models are generated. Why? Because these models are used in many fields, including, but not limited to, economics, environmental science, psychology, and medicine. The calculator debate also plays into a larger discussion of whether colleges should be less theoretical and more practical. For technology advocates, an increased emphasis on technology is often seen as a way to prepare students for the real world. Calculator opponents tend to see it differently. The goal of university education, they contend, is for students to get a good grasp of the theoretical foundation of a subject, not to master calculators or computers. After all, today’s technology might become drastically different 20 years from now, but a good foundation will always last. Even Socrates once quipped that a reliance on writing would lead to the deterioration of memory. And many of the best practices in pedagogy teach that memorization does have its merits when it comes to education, despite the invention of the internet and search engines. Drawing the line between the use of and barring of calculators could prove difficult, says Jon Star, an education professor at Harvard University. “That line is also moving as time goes on, at different levels. There might be students who bring different skills who put the line in different places,” Star noted. “I’m very wary of anyone who says it should be at one extreme or the other. ” Many schools opt for the middle way. While calculators might not be allowed on tests and exams, colleges know that   students will utilize programs such as Wolfram Alpha, a powerful   computational tool, to aid with calculus assignments. Homework problems often require calculator use, asking for solutions that involve cumbersome values or algebraic symbols that are too tedious to compute by hand. Will future professors who were born in a generation of smartphones and tablets change the course of this discussion? Only time will tell.", "prop": 0.025554047851851704},

{"article": " (CNN)  Aubameyang and his father are not only bound by blood ties. Father and son have history when it comes to the two defining moments in Gabon’s football past. Twice ”Les Panthères” have made the quarterfinals of the Africa Cup of Nations. Twice they have played out   draws before going out on penalties.  Both times, the team representing this African nation of around 1. 8 million people starred a man named Aubameyang. ”He was captain, now I’m captain, and I’m proud to lead this national team,” Borussia Dortmund striker Aubameyang tells CNN, 16 years after his father’s team lost to Tunisia.  The    knows plenty about carrying the weight of a nation’s expectations.  Gabon’s only other appearance in the last eight of the AFCON came when it   the competition with neighbor Equatorial Guinea in 2012. While it was a success on a personal level for Aubameyang    he scored three goals during the tournament    it was ultimately his miss in the penalty shootout against Mali that meant his team fell short once again. He walked back to the halfway line before collapsing to the turf in tears and, as the stadium emptied, father and son were left to reflect upon another opportunity lost. This year’s tournament offers a chance of redemption.  Gabon might only be 110th in the FIFA world rankings    below the likes of Swaziland, Rwanda and Sierra Leone    but in star man Aubameyang, it boasts one of the world’s deadliest strikers.  And, with Real Madrid legend José Antonio Camacho coaching the team, the 2017 AFCON host nation has real cause for hope.  ”I think it’s a really important challenge,” says Aubameyang. ”We have a good team . .. Why not win this trophy for the first time?” WATCH:   Aubameyang challenges Usain Bolt to a race  Like father, like son, Born in France and invited to play for Italy’s   following a spell at AC Milan, Aubameyang might never have represented Gabon at all, had it not been for the influence of his father, known during his playing days as Pierre ”Yaya” Aubame. ”It’s my culture,” shrugs the Dortmund star, reflecting on their close relationship. ”He taught me so many things about this country as captain of the national team. I lived all the time in France but it’s like I was born in Gabon. ”For me, this choice was easy because my father was my first favorite player. I was in the stadium watching him for the first time when I was maybe three years old, and straight away I knew I wanted to do it like him. That’s it.” Like his father, Aubameyang spent his formative years in French football    cutting his teeth at Dijon, Lille, Monaco and eventually   in a succession of loan deals from parent club AC Milan.  But while the career of his Dad would eventually fade into relative obscurity    comprising stints at Colombian club Atlético Junior and a season back home in his native Gabon    the same cannot be said of the Dortmund forward.  When he broke Ivory Coast midfielder Yaya Toure’s   hold on the award in 2016, Aubameyang became the first ever Gabonese player to be named African Player of the Year. His peers in Germany football voted him the Players’ Player of the Year last season after he scored 25 Bundesliga goals. And, with 16 league goals in 15 appearances so far this campaign, he’s leading the charge for the European Golden Shoe, previously won by football greats such as Gerd Muller, Marco van Basten and Cristiano Ronaldo. If Aubameyang succeeds, he will become the first ever African winner.  Already his nation’s top goalscorer and a 2016 Ballon d’Or nominee, he’s even challenged Usain Bolt to a race. It’s enough to make any father proud.  ”He told me already that he wants me to continue the way I’m going,” smiles Aubameyang, the youngest of three brothers who have all spent time on the books of AC Milan, but the only one to break into the big time.   ”I think he’s happy but every time he tells me ’You can do it better, you can do it better’ and so that’s the way.” The way forward, If Aubameyang has gone from strength to strength, can Gabon go    with Africa’s football powerhouses? First up, the hosts need to navigate a group that comprises Burkina Faso and Cameroon as well as Saturday’s opponents  . ”Every time, we get the best teams,” laments Aubameyang. ”It’s crazy! ”Cameroon are big and it will be a hard game for sure.  But we did well against Burkina Faso last year so I think we have our chances. ”It’s another year but like I said before we have a good team    young players, but talented players, so for sure we have to advance past the first round.” His father will be watching on hoping he does just that.", "prop": 0.11239687160845899},

{"article": "Simon Cowell is returning to American television as a judge on the 11th season of “America’s Got Talent”  —   which Cowell created in 2006 (it spawned “Britain’s Got Talent,” on which Cowell is a judge). He’ll join host Nick Cannon and fellow judges Heidi Klum, Mel B. and Howie Mandel when the new season of “AGT” premieres May 31. Cowell, 56, was last seen in prime time here on “The X Factor,” the Fox version of his British hit which ended in December 2013 after three (mostly disappointing) seasons. Cowell talked to The Post about his role on “AGT,” what went wrong with “The X Factor” and his reputation as the “nasty” judge. [Laughs] Well, years ago, I had a conversation with NBC about doing this show and they offered me a really good deal overall. At the time I was on “Idol” and it didn’t feel like the right thing to do. NBC always had these conversations with me and the question was not if, but when. Howard [Stern, who left “AGT”] was doing good on the show and it was always his choice whether he wanted to stay or go, but we never knew year to year. He didn’t like the traveling, or whatever it was. Any thoughts I had about being the boss was soon shattered on Day One. These four know each other so well and I felt like the new boy  —   and almost like I had to prove myself. It’s obviously one of our biggest shows so I sometimes came in for the finals, or if I didn’t come in for the finals I watched them. I’d go down to the tapings sometimes and sit with the team. The only thing I felt was missing [was] I thought we could do better with the music acts. That wasn’t our strong point. We’ve had one successful singer over the years, Jackie Evancho, and I think with the “Got Talent” brand, even though it’s a variety show, I still think the music acts are important. That was my number one mission: To see if I could attract better music acts to the show. And we do have better music acts this season, that’s for sure. It was a mess. First of all, we should’ve waited for “Idol” to end and then launch “X Factor” in its spot. That would’ve been the smart thing   …     not having the shows on at the same time   …     In hindsight, we panicked   …     and I opened my big mouth when I said we’d get 20 million viewers [a week]. When I look back on it, some stupid decisions were made. But I’m a big boy. It’s a learning curve   …     And we got [singing group] Fifth Harmony from Season 2, so we found some stars. I don’t think you change as a person. When I look back at early [“American Idol”] clips   …     what people do forget is that I was different from the other judges  —   I was British and said what I’d always said. I thought it was funny, [that I was] not being mean. I think people also forget that what I did mainly in those early days was I found stars, whether it was Kelly Clarkson or Carrie Underwood. And I think people think more about the ‘mean’ things I said when I was really being positive and trying to help people and spot talent. That’s what I’m most proud of. No. I remember once [in 2007]   …     when I was in trouble for   I thought it was funny but, my God, did I get it in the neck.

{"article": "Earlier this week, Fox News’ Tucker Carlson asked a guest on his show if it were true that the United States government has been “looting” Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. [His guest, a mortgage industry analyst named Joshua Rosner, described the bailout that has kept alive the two mortgage finance giants since their collapse in 2008 and subsequent need for $187. 5 billion of taxpayer funding, as “a simple theft. ”   Not a theft from taxpayers —  but from Fannie and Freddie’s shareholders. While it was jarring to see Carlson and Fox not even attempt to challenge an advocate for the two   mortgage companies —  long the targets of conservative critics who argued they distorted mortgage markets, enjoyed a privileged status of being   by the U. S. government even before they were bailed out, and were primary causes of the financial crisis —  Rosner’s basic argument is hardly new. Hedge funds and other big investors, including Perry Capital LLC and the Fairholme Funds, have been making similar arguments in federal courts for years —  to no avail. The cases have been met by dismissal in four federal district courts and last month a federal appeals court largely rejected the bid by investors to reverse one of those decisions. On Fox, however, Rosner gave the shareholder cause a novel twist —  one designed to appeal to conservatives and perhaps the Trump administration despite its lack of grounding in evidence or logic. According to Rosner, the U. S. Treasury is taking funds from Fannie and Freddie to pay for Obamacare —  perhaps the one thing loathed more by conservatives than bailouts of putatively private companies. “Essentially, in 2012, to avoid dealing with Republicans on the debt ceiling, on sequester, and to fund Obamacare, the Obama administration took Fannie and Freddie’s profits,” Rosner said. The message: if you hate Obamacare, you should support the cause of the hedge funds seeking to profit by prying Fannie and Freddie out of government hands.  And please pay no attention to the fact that the two companies have always needed —  and will always need, unless they are eliminated —  the backing of the U. S. taxpayer.  Fannie and Freddie: The Walking Dead, Fannie and Freddie provide liquidity to the housing market by buying mortgages from lenders, packaging them into securities whose principal and interest payments they guarantee. Prior to their 2008 collapse, Fannie and Freddie were widely viewed as enjoying an “implicit guarantee” from the U. S. government, enabling them to earn enormous profits because investors viewed their bonds as being safe —  or nearly so —  as U. S. Treasury bonds, The companies were taken over by the U. S. government in 2008 when officials feared their collapse could further destabilize the housing and financial markets. Treasury provided hundreds of billions of funding while the Federal Housing Finance Agency became their conservator.   Under their original agreement with the U. S. Treasury, both companies were supposed to pay a dividend equal to 10% of their taxpayer funding as well as a fee on the hundreds of billions more Treasury had pledged to support them. For years, however, neither company earned enough to pay the dividend, which forced them to draw even more from their bailout funds just to send the money back to Treasury as the dividend. This circular draw, as it came to be called, threatened to put the companies into a death spiral, slowly eating away at the remainder of the Treasury backstop. In   Treasury and the FHFA agreed to change the terms of the bailout so that Fannie and Freddie would no longer have a fixed dividend —  ending the need for circular draws. Instead, each company would have a flexible dividend obligation that would rise and fall with their profits. Because the new dividend is equal to the positive net worth of each company, less a small capital cushion set to decline each year, it is known as the “net worth sweep. ” At the time the net worth sweep was implemented, Treasury Department officials noted that in addition to ending the circular draws and death spiral, the arrangement would facilitate the eventual wind down of the companies by preventing them from using profits to recapitalize as   designed a safe, more stable mortgage finance system.  Because every attempt at bipartisan mortgage finance reform legislation stalled out on Capitol Hill, neither company has been  . Instead, they have remained in conservatorship and supported by taxpayer backing for more than eight years —  a situation that nearly everyone involved in mortgage finance reform regards as undesirable. “These companies are zombies. They died in 2008 but they’ve been kept alive by the contaminant of government backing ever since —  all because every attempt to build a better system has gone nowhere,” said one former government housing official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Conservatives Balk At Net Worth Sweep For Keeping Companies Alive, The net worth sweep was designed by the Obama administration in part to placate conservative critics of the two companies. Obama housing officials believed that merely lowering the dividend obligation to a level the companies could afford would invite criticism from Republican lawmakers that Fannie and Freddie were getting a second bailout —  a bailout from their bailout. Since the net worth sweep would produce larger dividends if the companies were highly profitable and lower dividends when they were not, it balanced the risks to taxpayers with potential rewards, in the view of several Obama administration officials who spoke on background. Nonetheless, the net worth sweep met with initial resistance from Republican lawmaker who feared it would delay the wind down of the companies. “The reduction of the dividend payments for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will ensure the American taxpayers remain on the hook for the bailout of these two failed institutions,” Congressman Scott Garrett ( ) the chairman of the House Financial Service Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Entities, said in a statement.  “Instead of devoting time and energy to prolonging bailouts, Obama administration should work with Congress to wind these companies down and create a new and sustainable housing finance system where taxpayers are not at risk,” Rep. Garrett said. This prompted an email, made public in one of the shareholder lawsuits, from an Obama administration official named Jim Parrott to complain that the net worth sweep had been misunderstood.  “We’re not reducing their dividend but including in it every dime these guys make going forward and ensuring that they can’t recapitalize,” Parrott wrote to one of Rep. Garrett’s staffers. This didn’t fully satisfy the staffer. “In regards to them keeping additional profits, in my mind that is only an accounting issue, gov recoups now (per new method) or later when we liquidate them and then realize those gains for the taxpayer,” the staffer wrote back. Summarizing the    Parrott wrote to the Treasury Department’s Timothy Bowler: “We’ve closed off possibility that they every [sic] go (pretend) private again and sped up the clock on the wind down of their portfolio, all while increasing the stability of the markets by removing concern that these guys run out of support before we have a place to which to transition. ” Despite this initial resistance, however, there was very little sustained opposition from conservatives to the net worth sweep —  largely because it was presented as a step toward the wind down of Fannie and Freddie.  The Hedge Funds Strike Back, Resistance to the sweep arose from another, unanticipated quarter: hedge fund managers and other large investors who acquired large amounts of the preferred and common shares of Fannie and Freddie —  betting that the government wouldn’t succeed in winding them down and that they would eventually be revived. Several hedge funds made a fortune in the wake of the financial crisis by snapping up shares of   financial companies, such as failed insurance giant AIG and banking giants Citigroup Bank of America, when many investors still shunned the sector. Investors like Bruce Berkowitz of Fairholme and John Paulson of Paulson  Co, who had made a fortune shorting housing before the crisis, came to see themselves as heroic allies of the government’s attempt to rescue the financial companies. Some former Obama administration officials encouraged them to see Fannie and Freddie as presenting similar opportunities. If the government couldn’t wind down the entities, these former officials said, it might wind up recapitalizing them and releasing them to the public —  just as it had with AIG. With the common shares trading at pennies a share and the preferred at deep discounts to face value, the upside potential could be huge. Perry Capital, Paulson  Co, and Fairholme Funds all acquired stakes in the companies. Later, activist investor William Ackman’s Pershing Square would become the largest holder of the common stock of Fannie and Freddie. Others followed the lead of these prominent investors. The trouble was that the Obama administration did not go along with what the hedge fund managers believed to be the script to their next windfall play. It insisted that the companies remain in conservatorship —  and subject to the net worth sweep —  so long as no comprehensive housing finance reform was forthcoming. Which meant that instead of acting as allies of government policies, the funds were now fighting it. Perry Capital, Fairholme and Pershing Square all sued the government in federal court. They argued that the ongoing conservatorship violated the law and that they net worth sweep illegally deprived them of the profits of the companies.  It quickly became conventional wisdom on Wall Street that the net worth sweep was “obviously illegal. ” Shares of the companies rocketed upward as investors piled into the trade that the “smart money” had endorsed. Top flight legal scholars, such as New York University’s Richard Epstein and Yale University’s Jonathan Macey, added their support to the hedge fund cause —  in Epstein’s case, at least, while receiving consulting fees from one of the investors. Hopes for a court room victory were bolstered as Fannie and Freddie turned in record profits in 2013 and 2014, thanks in part to reversals of past losses,   of once abandoned deferred tax assets, and legal settlements with large banks. Shareholders gleefully declared the government’s worry about a death spiral as a ruse and described the mortgage giants as “the most profitable companies in the world,” ignoring warnings that the artificially high profit levels would soon fall. In subsequent years, however, profits did fall by enough that both companies would once again have struggled or failed to pay the original 10 percent dividend. The Influence Vultures Take Flight, Paulson  Co did not join the lawsuits, although his internal legal advisors believed the courts would side with the investors, according to people familiar with the matter. But that didn’t mean Paulson sat by passively. Instead, Paulson helped finance a behind the scenes lobbying campaign urging the government to relinquish its controls on the mortgage giants, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. Lobbying efforts included campaign donations to sympathetic politicians as well as giving cash to minority advocacy groups that voiced support for Fannie and Freddie, the Wall Street Journal reported. Some advocacy groups in Washington, D. C. began offering donations to groups and individuals who agreed to write   advocating for the release and recapitalization of Fannie and Freddie, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. The Wall Street Journal reported that the Raban Group, a Washington lobbying firm, offered a minority trade association $25, 000 contingent on signing its name to an   arguing for the    of Fannie and Freddie, according to the Wall Street Journal. In 2014, John Paulson’s private foundation donated $25, 000 to the Leadership Conference Education Fund, an arm of a coalition of   civil rights advocacy groups, the Wall Street Journal revealed. The Leadership Conference has been an outspoken advocate for the release of Fannie and Freddie to private control.  The DCI Group, a Washington lobbyist outfit that works on behalf of Fannie and Freddie shareholder pressure group Investors Unite, gave the Leadership Conference a total of $325, 000 in donations, according to the Wall Street Journal.  In June of 2016, a group of primarily   New York Baptist ministers calling itself ‘Our Loans Matter’ held a rally near Wall Street. Video of the rally was posted on Twitter by none other than Tucker Carlson’s Obamacare funding critic Josh Rosner, who is manging director at Graham Fisher  Co. which bills itself as an independent research consultancy. The accompanying hashtag: #ourloansmatter.  “Wow.  #OurLoansMatter rally in Wall Street w leading Pastors,” Rosner said in another tweet. Wow. #OurLoansMatter rally in Wall Street w leading Pastors pic. twitter.   —   joshua rosner (@JoshRosner) June 17, 2016,  The Our Loans Matter group decried efforts to   Fannie and Freddie, saying they would hurt homeownership opportunities for “our parishioners,” in an October 2016 letter to New York’s Senator Chuck S`chumer and the FHFA’s Mel Watt. That same summer, Rosner appeared on Perspectives, a television show “geared to discussing contemporary topics affecting the   community. ” His message there was very different than the one he delivered to Tucker Carlson about Fannie and Freddie’s profits allegedly being used to support Obamacare. Instead, he argued that the government is “now in the process of eliminating Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, essentially to hand the business to the big banks, who already are the ones who are likely to overcharge borrowers for home loans. ” There’s no evidence that most big banks want to be in the business of being in the   position on the types of loans Fannie and Freddie tend to back. In fact, the biggest banks have been losing market share to nonbank lenders and retreating from the riskier parts of the market. Rosner went on to argue that eliminating Fannie and Freddie would reduce minority homeownership —  and thereby increase crime, damage the quality of education and reduce people to being “wage slaves. ” Rosner has long been an advocate of homeownership while still criticizing loose credit the practices of banks as well as Fannie and Freddie. Indeed, he was one of the few who understood years before the financial crisis that Fannie and Freddie had taken on —  and disguised —  far more credit risk than they should. He famously criticized low to no downpayment mortgages by saying, “A home without equity is just a rental with debt. ” Currently, he argues that Fannie and Freddie should become   utilities whose profits and practices are stringently regulated but whose shares are owned by investors. His views are not influenced by hedge funds or other investors in Fannie and Freddie, he said. “I put my own views out there and I’ve been remarkably consistent. Anyone who looks at my record knows I’m not for sale,” Rosner said in an phone interview.   Crash and Burn, Despite the sums spent on lobbying and litigating against the government, the hedge funds and other investors did not gain much traction. The Obama administration stood firm in its position that Fannie and Freddie would not be released or recapitalized without congressional action. Capitol Hill lawmakers agreed, including in 2015’s omnibus budget “sense of Congress” provision that demanded the the administration make no changes to Fannie and Freddie’s status without congressional approval. The passage of time did not improve the odds for the hedge funds. As recently as last week, a bipartisan group of Senators sent a letter to FHFA director Mel Watt, who oversees the conservatorships of Fannie and Freddie, that he should not allow the companies to recapitalize without congressional approval. The lawmakers warned against “any administrative action that would adversely impact” efforts underway to legislate housing finance reform. If Capitol Hill and the White House have been cool to the hedge funds’ pleas, the reception in federal courts has been even frostier. In the fall of 2014, a federal court completely dismissed a group of shareholder lawsuits, finding that the government acted well within its rights when it implemented the net worth sweep. At first, the decision was derided by shareholders and their advocates but as court after court reached similar conclusions —  including the influential D. C. Circuit —  hopes for a hedge fund win in the courts withered. Rosner points out that the Obama administration kept from the public over 10, 000 documents investors have sought in connection with the litigation, a practice that the Trump administration has continued. He argues that the documents are likely to show that the motivations for putting in the net worth sweep were different from those stated by government officials. In any case, the public deserves to know what is in those documents, Rosner says. “Let’s see what’s in them. I think it will be  . If I’m wrong about the motivations here, I’ll be the first to say so,” Rosner said in a phone interview. Hope Revived, Briefly  The election of Donald Trump as President briefly revived hopes that the administration would embrace a policy that would bring the   windfall to Fannie and Freddie investors. Although Trump himself has not taken a position on housing finance reform, Fannie investor John Paulson had been a big fund raiser for Trump, hosting a $50, 000 per plate dinner in NYC. Paulson was reportedly picked to be the Trump transition teams advisor on housing policy. What’s more, Trump had reportedly invested between $3 million and $15 million in Paulson’s hedge fund. A day after he was tapped to be Trump’s Treasury Secretary nominee, Steve Mnuchin appeared to bolster the prospects that the hedge funds could finally wrest control of Fannie and Freddie from the government.  “We got to get Fannie and Freddie out of government ownership,” Steven Mnuchin said on Fox Business Network in November. “It makes no sense that these are owned by the government and have been controlled by the government for as long as they have. ” “Trump Treasury May Mean Independence for Fannie and Freddie,” the New York Times declared in a headline. The accompanying article was written by columnist Gretchen Morgenson, who   2011’s Reckless Endangerment with Josh Rosner. Shares of Fannie and Freddie soared. Morgenson described the euphoria among the   Fannie and Freddie investors that followed these comments:  The revival of this particular dream of avarice, however, was quickly quashed. At his confirmation hearing in January, Mnuchin told the Senators his comments had been misinterpreted. “My comments were never that there should be a recap and release,” Mnuchin said. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has continued to fight the hedge funds in court —  and continued to stack up legal victories. There are no signs that the Justice Department, Treasury, or the FHFA is considering settling with the litigious hedge funds or backing away from the government’s strong hand in these lawsuits. Sources inside the Treasury Department say the administration is still reviewing a wide variety of housing financing reforms options but is not planning on making any changes to the conservatorship or dividend of Fannie and Freddie without congressional authorization. On Capitol Hill, Senators and Representatives are already at work on a new version of housing finance reform legislation —  one that is unlikely to leave any value left over for shareholders of Fannie and Freddie, according to people familiar with the matter. “These guys overreached and they’ve accomplished something rare: bipartisan alienation. Both Republican and Democrat leaders can’t stand these Fannie hedge fund guys,” a person close to Capitol Hill housing reform efforts said. Time Traveling Obama Officials and Other Villians, Despite this most recent setback, efforts continue to influence the right to adopt the hedge funds’ position on Fannie and Freddie, in hopes that the Trump administration can still be brought around to changing its views.   legal scholars have been recruited and, in some cases, paid to write   and conservative outlets such as the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Daily Caller have run pieces adopting the hedge fund line on Fannie, Freddie, and the net worth sweep.  The latest argument appears   to lure in conservatives with claims that the Obama administration illicitly diverted funds from Fannie and Freddie to bankroll portions of the Affordable Care Act. Specifically, the funds were allegedly used to provide a substitute funding source after a federal court ruled that some subsidies that had been provided to insurers were improper. The trouble is that the changes to Fannie and Freddie’s bailout that net worth sweep in place were made in 2012, while the judge’s ruling on the Obamacare subsidies didn’t come until 2016. What’s more, the judge in the case has allowed the payments to continue pending appeal, which means there still isn’t a budget gap to fill. Absent a trip in Dr. Who’s TARDIS, it is unlikely the Obama administration foresaw an adverse court ruling four years in advance then put in place a controversial change to Fannie and Freddie’s bailout to avoid it. Another recent tactic has been to target those in the Trump administration viewed as both vulnerable and potential opponents of the hedge fund Fannie and Freddie agenda. Craig Phillips, a former BlackRock Inc. executive who was a big fundraiser for Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid, has recently come under fire. Phillips is leading Treasury’s review financial regulations —  and many on Capitol Hill worry he is not a supporter of the administration’s agenda to rollback the regulations. Supporters of the hedge fund agenda for Fannie and Freddie have been playing on these concerns and Phillips’ connections to former Obama administration officials in hopes that if conservatives were to force Phillips out, he could be replaced by a more pliant Treasury official. “They’ve flipped from seeking support from the civil rights types to seeking support from conservatives and libertarians,” said a staffer of a Republican Congressman who has been approached about his position on Fannie and Freddie. This type of political flexibility is not altogether unheard of in the nation’s capital. Back in 2011, Josh Rosner, who advocated for preserving Fannie and Freddie to preserve minority homeowners in 2016 and decried the alleged use of their funds to support Obamacare in 2017, appeared before a House oversight panel alongside Dr. Anthony Sanders, a George Mason University finance professor. “I really want to go with what the administration said earlier, which is to start paring them down if not dismantling them,” Sanders told the panel after arguing that Fannie and Freddie’s guarantees were keeping private capital out of the mortgage market. “I totally agree with that,” Rosner said moments later.

Antic, 34, now stands to get $0 in his lawsuit    —   well below his hopes for a $25 million payout. Trial in the   case pitting the 6′ ″ Antic against the police had been set to kick off on August 1st. Manhattan federal judge Jesse Furman didn’t explain why he tossed Antic’s lawsuit ahead of trial, saying only that he would explain his ruling “in a forthcoming opinion. ” But the judge hinted in the Wednesday court filing that he agreed with city lawyers who argued that Antic’s claims were bogus  —   in part because he was not harmed during his arrest. The 2015 melee at the center of the lawsuit began when   forward   who tried to intervene in an argument Copeland was having with a lady friend. That prompted the cops to force everyone to leave the Chelsea nightclub, including Antic and his former colleague, Hawks forward Thabo Sefolosha. Cops said Antic and Sefolosha were dragging their feet, prompting an officer to escort them to their SUV. Once outside the SUV, Sefolosha attempted to give a beggar money, prompting a nearby officer nearby think that Sefolosha was going after the officer who had escorted him to the car. They arrested Sefolosha. When Antic tried to intervene he, too, was arrested, court papers said. In April,   alleging false arrest and excessive force. Sefolosha said his arrest led to serious injuries, including a broken fibula and ligament damage, that forced him to sit out the remainder of the NBA regular season. City lawyer’s took a tougher stance on Antic’s claims, arguing that the cops “had ample probable cause to arrest” Antic because he tried to obstruct Sefolosha’s arrest. They also scoffed at Antic’s excessive force claim, arguing that he was not injured as a result of his arrest.

{"article": " The most heated fight at the Rio Olympics lasted just a minute and four seconds. It was a battle between good and evil, the fair and unfair, the clean and the cheaters, with a hint of a Cold War twist.    The conflict: a   breaststroke battle between two swimmers, American Lilly King and Russian Yulia Efimova. In Sunday’s qualifying race, King and Efimova came in first and second place, respectively, with times   of a second apart. But as they entered the aquatic center on Monday to swim in the final, there was a lot more riding on their matchup than an Olympic medal. Efimova’s reputation was tainted by controversy, as she had previously failed two drug tests and served a   suspension. In the end, King defeated Efimova and clinched the gold medal. But her victory was so much more than a personal win.    Who is Yulia Efimova? Efimova’s story of athletic success is marred by cheating  —   namely, positive drug tests. Efimova is one of the top swimmers in the world in breaststroke, winning world championships in the   and   events since she made her debut at the Beijing Olympics in 2008. At the London games in 2012, she won bronze in the   breaststroke.    In 2013, Efimova tested positive for DHEA, a banned steroid hormone considered an anabolic agent by the World   Agency. She served a   ban for the substance. Then, earlier this year, Efimova tested positive for meldonium, the substance that Maria Sharapova tested positive for. A month ago, Efimova wasn’t even supposed to be swimming at the Olympics.    ”She was one of seven Russian swimmers barred from the games who had either failed doping tests or were named in the World   Agency’s investigation into   doping,” the Los Angeles Times reported, explaining the International Swimming Federation’s second ban on Efimova But this past week, Efimova was reinstated, much to the dismay of both swimming fans and fellow athletes. Why do people hate Efimova? On Sunday, August 7, Efimova swam in the   breaststroke preliminary heat. After qualifying for the final with the   time, Efimova was booed. She raised her finger in a ”number one” sign after the race. It was a surreal scene, the type that just doesn’t happen at the Olympics.    Essentially, lots of people  —   her competitors, NBC’s commentators, fans  —   believe Efimova doesn’t deserve to be at the Olympics. In their eyes, she got away with cheating. She can’t shake the lingering specter that her qualifying time might be due to doping. And what about the women who don’t dope that she’s already beaten in races? ”You know, you’re shaking your finger number one and you’ve been caught for drug cheating,” King said in an interview with NBC after taking the top spot in the   qualifier. While waiting for her heat to begin, she watched Efimova’s semifinal and wagged her finger at the swimmer. ”I’m just not a fan,” King added. As SB Nation explains, Efimova could have been facing a lifetime ban for her second doping violation. But she was given a sliver of grace. ”Because she tested positive soon after the drug was added to the list of prohibited drugs in January, Efimova was cleared to participate in the Olympics in July,” the site reported. ”The International Swimming Federation allowed her and many others back in the pool on the basis that it was unclear just how long meldonium stays in the body.” Efimova’s history of cheating put an ugly tint on Monday’s final  —   making it so much more than just a competition about who can swim the fastest. It became about the integrity of the sport. Efimova became the embodiment of the systemic doping in the Russian athletic system. And Lilly King became the only person who could conceivably beat her. The   breaststroke final was amazing and lived up to the hype  Even with all the stakes and beef present in the women’s   breaststroke final, it lived up to expectations. Thanks to their very close qualifying times, King and Efimova were placed in lanes right next to each other. King stared Efimova down as the two waited to begin the race. When Efimova’s name was announced, the crowd let loose a flurry of boos.    King was slightly ahead of Efimova for about 75 percent of the race. But Efimova has great closing speed and pushed King at the very end  —   King really had to work to hold onto her scrap of a lead and ended up finishing with a time of 1 minute 4. 93 seconds  —   good enough for gold and a half a second faster than Efimova. Efimova had been silent leading up to the race, and didn’t outright address the doping allegations until after she won silver. In a   interview she intimated that the first doping violation was her fault, but this second was out of her control. ”I have once made mistakes and been banned,” Efimova said. ”The second time it was not my mistake.” After the race, NBC’s Michele Tafoya asked King if she was trying to send a message with her win. ”I hoped I did, that we can compete clean and still win at the Olympic Games,” King said. When King beat Efimova, she slapped the water in between them in triumph. She shot over a stare. And Efimova didn’t raise her finger.    ”There is a way to become the best and do it the right way,” King said at press conference after her race. Efimova races again in the   breaststroke on Wednesday.  ", "prop": 0.22983285097924394},

{"article": "LONDON  —   Maybe it wasn’t just the iceberg. Ever since the Titanic sank more than 104 years ago, killing more than 1, 500 men, women and children, mystery has swirled around the tragedy. No one doubts that the ship collided at high speed with an iceberg off the coast of Newfoundland. But a new documentary posits that the sinking of the ship  —   hailed at the time as the largest ever built, and praised for its professed unsinkability  —   may have been accelerated by a giant coal fire in its hull that appeared to have started as long as three weeks before it set off on its fateful journey to New York from Southampton, England. In the documentary, which was broadcast on Channel 4 in Britain on New Year’s Day, Senan Molony, an Irish journalist who has spent more than 30 years researching the Titanic, contends that the fire, in a    bunker next to one of the ship’s boiler rooms, damaged its hull, helping to seal its fate long before it slammed into the iceberg. “It’s a perfect storm of extraordinary factors coming together: fire, ice and criminal negligence,” he argues in the documentary, “Titanic: The New Evidence,” which will air in the United States on the Smithsonian Channel on January 21. “The fire was known about, but it was played down. She should never have been put to sea. ” Mr. Molony’s potential breakthrough can be traced to an attic in Wiltshire, in southwest England, where a previously unpublished album of photographs chronicling the ship’s construction and the preparations for its maiden voyage had been gathering dust for more than a century. The photographs were discovered by a descendant of a director of the   company, Harland and Wolff, that built the Titanic. About four years ago, a collaborator of Mr. Molony’s acquired the rare photographs of the ship, meticulously taken by Harland and Wolff’s engineering chief before it left a Belfast shipyard. When the two men looked closely at the images, Mr. Molony said, they were shocked to discover a    diagonal black mark on the hull’s front starboard side, close to where the ship was pierced by the iceberg. An analysis by engineers at Imperial College London subsequently revealed that the mark was most likely caused by a fire in a coal bunker of the ship. Mr. Molony called the photographs “the Titanic equivalent of Tutankhamen’s tomb,” because of the richness of historical detail they conveyed, including the mark highlighting the extent of the damage. Experts said the theory was compelling but were divided over how important a role the fire may have played. In an interview, Richard de Kerbrech, a marine engineer based on the Isle of Wight who has written two books on the Titanic disaster, said that the fire would have damaged the ship’s bulkhead, a wall of steel within the ship’s hull, and made it more vulnerable after it was pierced by an iceberg. An official British inquiry, in 1912, mentioned the fire, but the judge who presided over it, whom critics saw as sympathetic to shipping interests, played it down. “This discovery is a revelation and could change our knowledge of the history of what happened,” Mr. de Kerbrech said. Mr. Molony contends that the ship’s owners knew about the fire but chose to let it go, since delaying the ship’s journey would have been financially ruinous. At the time of departure, the ship was berthed so that the marks caused by the fire were facing the sea, away from the dock, and therefore concealed from passengers. The Titanic disaster has long fanned conspiracy theories, among them that it was not the Titanic that sank on April 15, 1912, but, rather the Olympic, its sister ship that the Titanic was torpedoed by a German   or that the ship was brought down by a sarcophagus containing an Egyptian priestess’s mummy. Popularized by Hollywood, the story of the Titanic continues to exert a hold on popular culture. Construction of a   replica recently began at a theme park in China. Mr. Molony said his fascination took root when he was 12 and was gripped by “A Night to Remember,” Walter Lord’s 1955 book recounting the Titanic’s final night. He said he was so captivated that he finished the book in two hours and 40 minutes, the same time it took the Titanic to sink. Now the political editor at The Irish Daily Mail, Mr. Molony, who has also written a book called “The Irish Aboard Titanic,” was also drawn to the social divisions reflected on the ship, where   cabins hosted millionaires while hundreds of   passengers, many of them Irish, stayed below. Mr. Molony said he believed the fire had been played down, in part because death by iceberg was a more dramatic explanation. “The ship was seen as a heroic unsinkable ship and, as a result, people focused on explanations that fed that narrative,” he said. Not everyone is convinced. David Hill, a former honorary secretary of the British Titanic Society, who has been studying the cause of the sinking since the 1950s, argued that, while the damage caused by the fire to the steel walls protecting the hull may have hastened the disaster, the blaze was not the decisive factor. “When the Titanic hit the iceberg close to midnight on April 14, 1912, it created a    line of damage on the starboard section of the hull, including punctures and gashes, that opened up too many compartments to the sea, so that the weight of the water dragged the bow down so low that the ship eventually sank,” he said. “A fire may have accelerated this. But in my view, the Titanic would have sunk anyways. ” He added: “It amazes me how this ship still captures the global imagination. It was not the   catastrophe at sea. But it is the one everyone remembers. ”", "prop": 0.09224681881351159},

[The protests, which were aimed at University System President Tim Wolfe and the administration’s alleged mishandling of several racial incidents on campus, became the focus of several national news stories. According to the protesters, several racial incidents spanning across the last five years were ignored by the university, even though the movement’s admits that many of these incidents occurred  . They collectively put together a list of demands, one of which was a call for Wolfe’s resignation.  Immediately following the resignation of both the University System President and Chancellor, a video of University of Missouri Professor Melissa Click calling for the physical removal of a student photographer on assignment for ESPN quickly spread around the web. Click was charged with misdemeanor assault as a result of her exchange with the photographer. Even though a letter signed by 100 faculty members in defense of Click was presented to the administration, she was ultimately terminated by the university on February 25th.

{"article": "  of State Hillary Clinton appears to have sought inside information on a potential European Union bailout as her    Marc Mezvinsky, speculated on defaulting Greek bonds in 2012 with CalPERS’ public pension cash as his hedge fund was getting wiped out. [Fox News reported late last week that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who served from January 21, 2009 and until stepping down on February 1, 2013 in advance of her run for president, sought “secret info on European Union bailout plans as [her]   ’s doomed hedge fund gambled on Greece. ”  A former Goldman Sachs broker, Mezvinsky formed the Eaglevale Partners hedge fund in October 2011 with two   Sachs partners. Eaglevale was incorporated in the secretive tax haven of the Cayman Islands in October 2011, then immediately named Goldman Sachs as its prime broker and banker. Eaglevale would raise $325 million from CalPERS and others through a “special arrangement” with Goldman Sachs to engage in a “global macro” strategy to seek profit from opportunities in “politically volatile situations. ” Goldman Sachs has donated $5 million to the Clinton Foundation paid Hillary Clinton $675, 000 in speaking fees was Hillary Clinton’s fourth largest contributor to her 2008 presidential campaign with $407, 850 and  —   via its employees  —   is the sixth largest contributor to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign with $466, 978 in donations. Goldman has an extremely dicey history of manipulating the value of Greek debt. To help the perpetually insolvent nation qualify to join the euro in 2001, Goldman set up derivative   swaps with “fictional interest rates. ” The structure allowed the Greek government to borrow another $10 billion in debt payable in U. S. dollars and Japanese yen by pretending the Greek treasury had an extra $1 billion in cash. After the European Union bailed out Greece in 2010 to prevent an international banking collapse, Goldman’s derivative activity was investigated by the U. S. Securities  Exchange Commission, according to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. The only “situation” Eaglevale seems to have invested in was buying distressed Greek bonds at big discounts. The hedge fund speculated that the European Union would protect bondholders, requiring Greece to slash health and welfare spending. The same month Mezvinsky started his hedge fund, Gary Gensler, chair of the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates hedge funds,   Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that a bailout by the European Central Bank could “turn market sentiment” in favor of Greek bonds. Gensler was former   of Corporate Finance at Goldman Sachs, is currently the Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign’s Chief Financial Officer, and expects to be named Secretary of Treasury if Hillary Clinton is elected President. According to   subpoenaed regarding her use of a   personal server while Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton “kept a sharp eye on intelligence assessing the chances of a bailout of the Greek central bank” in 2012. Robert Hormats, Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment from 2009 to 2013 and a former Vice Chairman of Goldman Sachs, shared an extensive   chain with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during the crisis about the possibility of bailing out Greece. Included   contained classified materials and internal State Department memos about the debt from the U. S. Ambassador to Greece. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton shared   about the Greek bond restructuring with husband Bill Clinton and    Marc Mezvinsky. The   were not produced under the original 2014 subpoena regarding the private server, because the State Department had deemed the communications “protected” government communications. The recently produced   also reveal that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was sharing “classified information” about how the German government viewed the prospects for a Greek bailout with Clinton Foundation consultant Sidney Blumenthal. Sharing such inside information with friends and family is a conflict of interest under the United States Office of Government Ethics and is grounds to be “disqualified from working on a particular Government matter. ” But more importantly, it may have been a violation of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 prohibition on inside trading. Eaglevale picked up $13 million from the CalPERS public employee pension fund in April 2012 to invest it in distressed Greek bonds. At the same time, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and Chelsea Clinton’s former boss Marc Lasry both bought Greek bonds. Despite all of the work by the U. S. State Department in favor of a bailout that would have been a home run for Greek bondholders, the German government opposed a blanket   and Greek bonds crashed even lower in price. It is believed that CalPERS suffered a 100 percent loss on its investment.", "prop": 0.8732940332266306},

Following Ball’s twisted logic, the three sons apparently learned to refrain from misogynistic insults against their mom only so they could get what they needed from her. “I told them, ‘If you’re going to be disrespectful to your mom, I want you to be all the time.’ So, excuse my language right here, but if you want to say, ‘Good morning, b —  ’ that’s fine with me,” Ball   at the family’s home in Chino Hills, Calif.. “I’m not going to say nothing.

Because I say, ‘In the long run, you’re going to need her before you need me. ’” When it came to the boys breaking   rules, LaVar said he had no problem using physical punishment  —   “a couple of hits upside the head” to   Lonzo after he missed curfew and had a   with police or using a “belt or something” on youngest son LaMelo  —   before quickly backtracking. “I spanked them once,” Ball said as clarification, “to let them know there are repercussions at times. But my boys are respectful, and usually my voice is enough. ” Ball’s voice has been ringing in the ears of the basketball world since son Lonzo emerged as a star guard at UCLA and an expected   pick in the NBA draft on June 22. Tina, meanwhile, has been trying to regain her speech after she suffered a stroke in February that hospitalized her for about three months and damaged her verbal abilities. Ball said he’s been monitoring Tina since she returned home and feels confident he can restore her strength while their sons continue doing what they were raised to do: play basketball. “Like I told my boys: ‘I got her. Now you can do whatever you want to do. What I’m not going to is burden you with sitting there rubbing her hand.   …     We’re not making a movie,’” he said. “That’s my wife, and I take care of her. She wants to talk, and she can get out a few words. I’m rebooting her now right now. She’s saying, ‘LaVar, you’re right. You are right.’ That’s all I want to hear her say. Now we can get another 25 years having a good time. She is going to get better with me. ” Although Tina won’t be feeling well enough in time to attend the draft, Ball said, there’s no doubt in his mind Lonzo will wind up a Laker. And that assumption is only the first part of the equation. Next up in Ball’s wildly optimistic mind:    LiAngelo and    LaMelo will go “  ” and find their way to Los Angeles at any cost. “I’m going to do the same thing with Melo,” Ball said. “And we get three of the Ball boys on the Lakers together, and we gonna go championship, championship, championship, championship, championship.

{"article": "Budweiser has chosen the charged political issue of immigration as the subject of its Super Bowl LI commercial. [The   spot explains the origin story of the beer company’s immigrant   Adolphus Busch.  The ad, titled “Born the Hard Way,” begins with a young,   Busch being told, “You’re not wanted here! Go back home!” The big budget production eventually sees Busch land on the shores of St. Louis where he built his  . “This is the story of the original   man, one of the founders of the American Dream, making it the hard way, and his path that all came after him followed,” Laura Rowan, of Budweiser’s creative branch told Adweek. “We then see the words appear: ‘When nothing will stop your dream, this is the beer you’ll drink.’ We end with the Budweiser logo and [tagline] ‘This Bud’s for you,’” she said of the ad. Ricardo Marques, vice president and executive for the Budweiser brand in the U. S. says the company’s   Super Bowl ad is “relevant today,” in light of President Donald Trump’s executive order temporarily suspending the U. S. Refugee Admissions Program and his executive order intended to tighten security along the U. S.  border and enhance enforcement of U. S. immigration laws. “It’s true, Adolphus Busch made an incredible journey to this country, and that’s really what this is about. It’s about his vision, his dream, everything that he doest to achieve that,” Marques told AdWeek. “Even though it happened in the 1850s, it’s a story that is super relevant today. That’s what we’re honing in on it’s the pursuit, the effort, the passion, the drive, the hard work, the ambition, that’s really what this is about more than anything else. ” However, Marques insists that the ad’s placement during the Super Bowl is not an attempt at making a political statement. “There’s really no correlation with anything else that’s happening in the country,” he said. “We believe this is a universal story that is very relevant today because probably more than any other period in history today the world pulls you in different directions, and it’s never been harder to stick to your guns. ” Despite Marques’s assurance that the Super Bowl ad is not about making a political statement, his company has recently played politics with its commercials. Bud Light, another brand under the   InBev umbrella, hired and then fired   actors Amy Schumer and Seth Rogen, who starred in the beer brand’s “Bud Light Party” television  last year. One of the   ads enraged viewers, who slammed the Bud Light gender pay   commercial. What’s more,   InBev, which recently cut its revenue projections for the year after reporting a consistent sales slump, invested   levels on its short TV spot. Budweiser ads typically cost between $2 million to $3 million to produce. Add the record $5 million average cost for a   Super Bowl ad, and it’s easy to understand why the brewing company is hoping its $12 to $15 million commercial can spur growth in sales.

{"article": "BERLIN  —   Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party suffered the latest in a string of defeats in German state elections on Sunday, when her Christian Democratic Union was ousted from power in Berlin after its worst showing in the capital since World War II, according to preliminary results. Voters in Berlin turned out in higher numbers than in previous years, many responding to voter mobilization calls from the   Alternative for Germany party. The party is now poised to enter the  ’s legislature for the first time, although its share of the vote, 14. 2 percent in the preliminary results, was less than what it was two weeks ago in Ms. Merkel’s home state,   where it placed second. Ms. Merkel’s party won 17. 6 percent of the vote in Berlin, not enough to allow it to continue as the junior partner in a governing coalition with the Social Democrats. The   Social Democratic Party earned 21. 6 percent of the vote and is expected to form a government with two other parties: the Left Party, with 15. 6 percent, and the Greens, with 15. 2. “We are all angry that the AfD got in,” Michael Müller, Berlin’s mayor and the Social Democrats’ leading candidate, told cheering supporters in the capital, referring to the Alternative for Germany party. “But I can assure you that Berlin will remain an international city, open to the world. ” The result proved that the Alternative for Germany party is not as popular in Berlin as it is elsewhere, but it managed to draw considerable support, mostly from the city’s eastern districts. It campaigned hard against the chancellor’s decision last year to allow more than one million migrants into the country. Berlin is the 10th state in which the party has earned representation, and with little more than a year to go before the 2017 general election, the party appears to be gaining enough strength to earn seats in the national Parliament. Some commentators viewed the result as a chance for a rebirth of Germany’s struggling traditional parties and its overall democracy. “The success of the Alternative for Germany is a   call that it can’t be taken for granted that society is liberal and will remain so,” Heribert Prantl, a journalist at the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, wrote in a commentary. “Nor can it be taken for granted that minorities (and not only the refugees) are and will be respected. ” Many former supporters of the chancellor’s party drifted to the liberal Free Democratic Party, which voters returned to the state legislature with about 6 percent of the vote after it was ousted in the 2011 election. But the upstart Pirate Party, which won seats in the state Parliament in 2011, was voted out. Ms. Merkel, who governs on the national level in a coalition with the Social Democrats, had blamed Mr. Müller, the   mayor, for refusing to be held accountable for the chaotic circumstances faced by the 79, 000 refugees who arrived last year in the capital. “Based on my own experience, I know that leaders of government are always responsible, and they will be made responsible,” the chancellor said in an interview with the Berlin newspaper Tagesspiegel before the vote. Yet many in Ms. Merkel’s own conservative bloc have criticized her for allowing the refugee influx to become a crisis. Horst Seehofer, the leader of a Bavarian sister party to Ms. Merkel’s conservatives, has been among her loudest critics. In an interview released Friday, Mr. Seehofer threatened to withhold his party’s support for her in the 2017 election unless she agreed to set a limit on the number of new refugees to be admitted. Frank Henkel, the leading candidate for Ms. Merkel’s party in Berlin, blamed squabbling for the party’s poor showing in Berlin, saying the infighting had alienated voters and led them to question the bloc’s ability to govern.", "prop": 0.13012957855341925},

The $2 million commitment was placed on the agenda for a September 2010 conference of the Clinton Global Initiative at Mr. Clinton’s urging, according to a document from the period and people familiar with the matter. Mr. Clinton also personally endorsed the company, Energy Pioneer Solutions Inc. to   Secretary Steven Chu for a federal grant that year, said people with knowledge of the endorsement. The company, whose business plan was to insulate people’s homes and let them pay via their utility bills, received an $812, 000 Energy Department grant. Mr. Chu, now a professor at Stanford University, said he didn’t remember the conversation. The Clinton Global Initiative is a program of the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. The foundation has been a focus of criticism this political season over donations received from governments and corporations that had business before Mrs. Clinton when she was secretary of state and that could be affected by decisions she would make as president. The foundation has said it “has strong donor integrity and transparency practices. ” The Clinton Global Initiative’s help for a   company   by Clinton friends poses a different issue.

{"article": "Sen. Jeff Sessions appeared on Breitbart News Daily with host Stephen K. Bannon on Monday to discuss his endorsement of Donald Trump for President, noting that “a Trump election would kill the advancement of that   [Trans Pacific Partnership trade] agreement. ”[Sessions said he was impressed with the size of the crowd for his endorsement, and its energy.  “That stadium was filled,” he said of his appearance with Trump at the Madison City Schools stadium on Sunday.  “There were people from all categories of life.  You know, you had your young people with tattoos and things, you had some of the best civic and business people in the community  …     it was really sort of an expression of national concern about the country, and they’re seeing in Donald Trump a force that they think could break through the logjams we’re in, and advance America in a good way. ”  Sessions praised Trump for listening to American voters’ desire for a “lawful system of immigration” that “serves the national interest, and that is good for the people of America. ”   He also found voters to be “uneasy about these trade agreements that have not worked as promised, and they want us to slow down and protect American manufacturing and jobs. ” The Senator conceded that Trump is “not a perfect person,” and advised him to “clean up his speeches some, and be more focused” on these winning issues, but gave him credit for being a “smart and capable” leader who could bring new voters into the Republican Party. Sessions was especially forceful in his criticism of the Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement, which he saw as a serious threat to American sovereignty, as well as a menace to the economic interests of   voters. “I believe the advancement of the   partnership, with this   commission  —   the Pacific commission that would be created here, where each of our Pacific partners in that trade agreement, if it were adopted, would get one vote, and they set rules, they can change the rules, without Congress, without the permission of the American people  —   I think that’s a huge mistake,” he said.  “It absolutely should not happen. ” Unfortunately, Sessions added, his friend Senator Marco Rubio “voted for it, and he says it’s one of the three pillars of his foreign policy.  That worries me.  Trump is clear, and I think a Trump election would kill the advancement of that   agreement. ” He wanted a new deal, negotiated from a position of strength, with the understanding that America’s trade partners need us more than we need them  …     by a President who “understands that we’re not going to lose a single job as a result of an unfair trading agreement. ” Sessions saw the Gang of Eight immigration bill as another bad deal, made without due consideration for the needs of the American people, and criticized Rubio as the chief spokesman for that effort. He recalled advising the Gang of Eight to have law enforcement in the room when they designed the bill, including representatives of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers who could have explained “the loopholes and the problems, and the frustrations they have with trying to enforce the law. ” “But they didn’t want them,” Sessions noted ruefully.  “They had La Raza there, they had the Chamber of Commerce there  …     they had other special interest groups, the ACLU  …     the American people weren’t there, and law enforcement was not there. ”  Listen to the full audio of Sessions interview below: Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 weekdays from 6:00AM to 9:00AM EST.", "prop": 0.8566210367306265},
{"article": "Politicians in Stockholm said the policy of “ ” snow removal has failed after the weather brought Sweden’s capital to a standstill last week, with hospitals reporting a fourfold increase in broken bones. [The city switched to a “feminist” system of clearing snow last winter but last week’s burst of snow, which threw the city into chaos, has cast doubt on its effectiveness.  Hundreds of thousands of people were affected, with the majority of bus routes put out of service and commuters having to wait in queues for several hours. Previously, fresh snowfalls were cleared first from main roads and by areas like construction sites before being removed from pavements and cycle lanes. As men are more likely to drive and women more likely to travel on foot, more women slipped on the ice which led to complaints that the system was sexist.   of Stockholm, the Green Party’s Daniel Helldén, admitted that “equality snow removal” had failed the city, and apologised to residents who had injured themselves as a result. When the   coalition, comprising politicians from the Social Democratic Party, Green Party, Left Party, and Feminist Initiative, were elected to City Hall in 2014 the introduction of a “feminist” snow clearance was high on the agenda.

{"article": "Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said Monday that the Fed was shifting its focus from stimulating the economy to keeping growth on an even keel. She said the economy was “pretty healthy,” thanks in part to the Fed’s   stimulus campaign, which the central bank is moving to end. “Looking forward, I think the economy is going to continue to grow at a moderate pace,” Ms. Yellen said during an event at the University of Michigan. “Our job is going to be to try to set monetary policy to sustain what we have achieved. ” The Fed raised its benchmark interest rate in March for the third time since the financial crisis, and said it planned two more rate increases this year. The Fed also said it planned to begin reducing its large holdings of securities by the end of the year. Ms. Yellen did not offer any additional details during her appearance on Monday. Ms. Yellen, interviewed onstage by Susan M. Collins, the dean of the Ford School of Public Policy at the university, used the opportunity to make a strong case for the financial regulations enacted by Congress in the 2010   Act to address the problems revealed by the 2008 financial crisis. President Trump and congressional Republicans have said they want to eliminate or overhaul many of those measures, which they regard as ineffective in preventing future financial crises and as impediments to economic growth. Ms. Yellen pushed back on both counts. She cited changes that she said had increased the strength of the financial system, including requiring banks to raise more money from investors and subjecting large banks to annual stress tests. “We have accomplished a lot, and we have a much safer system,” she said. She also directly addressed the argument that the regulatory pendulum has swung too far and that government rules are preventing healthy financial activity. “I don’t think if you look at objective data on lending, that it’s possible to make the case that regulation has simply stifled lending,” Ms. Yellen said. “Lending is growing in a very healthy way as the economy has recovered. ” She said banks were actually in a better position to lend, although she acknowledged that the Fed would like to reduce the burden on smaller banks. Ms. Yellen’s assessment of economic conditions remained upbeat. She noted that the unemployment rate, which fell to 4. 5 percent in March, is now below the level that most Fed officials regard as sustainable. Consumer spending is growing at a decent pace, and Ms. Yellen noted that the global economy was also looking “slightly more robust and healthier. ” Though inflation remains a bit weaker than the 2 percent annual pace the Fed regards as healthy, she said it would be appropriate for the Fed to keep raising interest rates. She said, however, that the economy still faced problems that were beyond the power of monetary policy. While job growth has been strong, economic growth remains relatively slow, around 2 percent a year in recent years. If more people are working, making more things or doing more things in less time, the economy should be growing faster. “The fact that you can create that many jobs in the context of growth that is so low points to a significant problem,” Ms. Yellen said. “And the problem is that productivity growth is very low. ” Productivity measures the average person’s economic contribution. There are only two possible causes of economic growth: more people or increased productivity, which is to say, the same number of people making more stuff. We have slow population growth and slow productivity growth, so we have slow economic growth. Economists regard the slow pace of productivity growth as something of a mystery. Ms. Yellen tipped her hat to a number of the theories in circulation. Some economists think the flow of good ideas has simply slowed. Others point to a   in educational attainment. She also pointed to recent research that suggested one factor was a decline in corporate competition: less creation of new businesses and more corporate consolidation. Ms. Yellen said the combination of relatively fast job growth and relatively slow economic growth pointed to the underlying problem. She also fielded some lighter questions. Asked how she dealt with pressure, Ms. Yellen described herself as an “ardent believer” in the importance of a good night’s sleep. Asked for life advice, she encouraged students to find a profession that fills them with a sense of enthusiasm every day. “For me,” she said, “the core of having a satisfying career first and foremost was finding something to do that I really love. ”", "prop": 0.05919841234364269},
{"article": " The good folks at NASA never miss a chance to let us know when vital bodies of water around the world are shriveling up and vanishing. First it was Lake Mead. Then it was the Aral Sea.     Now it’s poor Utah’s turn. Earlier this week, NASA’s Earth Observatory posted satellite images showing the dramatic decline of Utah’s Great Salt Lake over the past five years. As the two images below from 2011 and 2016 show, water levels at Farmington Bay have plummeted, exposing   of the lakebed and threatening a key waterfowl habitat:                                       Suffice to say, that’s not good. The Great Salt Lake is one of the natural wonders of the West. It’s a terminal bay, which means rivers and streams flow in, but there’s nowhere for water to leave  —   except through evaporation. As a result, the minerals left behind just keep piling up. Today, NASA notes, the lake’s water is three to five times saltier than the ocean’s, creating a rich ecosystem that sustains brine shrimp, millions of migratory birds, waterfowl hunting, and so on. Mineral industries rely on it. It’s a key part of Utah’s economy, worth some $1. 2 billion per year.  Why the Great Salt Lake is drying up and shrinking But the lake is now in trouble. Ever since the first pioneers arrived in 1847, humans have been diverting more and more water from the rivers and streams that would otherwise feed the Great Salt Lake. Today, about 40 percent of that water gets used instead by farms, cities, and industry  —   causing the lake to recede.    The problem has only been exacerbated of late by brutal droughts (the sort of droughts, note, that are likely to get worse as global warming continues). Water levels in the lake are currently about 11 feet below their historic levels:            A recent paper, led by Utah State University’s Wayne Wurtsbaugh, warns that if water diversions continue to increase, it’s not impossible to imagine the lake drying up completely. The same thing happened to southern California in the 1920s, when water diversions to Los Angeles desiccated Owens Lake.    When a lake like this goes dry, things can get ugly. The paper notes that Los Angeles has spent at least $1. 3 billion since 2000 dealing with dust from the exposed Owens Lake lakebed  —   a major source of harmful particulate pollution that causes asthma and other lung ailments. Utah has already gotten a taste of this future: back in August 2015, a massive (and deadly) dust storm engulfed Salt Lake City.    And that’s just the start. If the lake keeps drying up, the paper notes, the region’s $57 million brine shrimp industry will wither. Water fowl will start to disappear, crippling the region’s $70 million hunting industry. Industries that harvest brine or minerals from the lake, like Morton Salt, will also suffer. Can Utah save the Great Salt Lake? The way to avoid this dire scenario is straightforward: stop diverting so much water from the lake. There’s some reason for optimism here: Wurtsbaugh and his colleagues note that per capita water use in cities dropped 18 percent between 1989 and 2000 (though overall urban water use is up 5 percent, as the population has grown). Conservation is possible; humans are surprisingly good at it when they have to be. But the real challenge will be convincing farmers, who account for 63 percent of the region’s water use, to join in the conservation efforts. There’s also a debate around nascent plans to develop of Bear River, which is the biggest river feeding the lake. An effort to divert drinking water from that river for   cities and towns in the Wasatch Front could shrink lake levels an additional 8. 5 inches, officials have said.    So it’s your standard tragedy of the commons. Here’s how Wurtsbaugh and his colleagues conclude: “We must be willing to make decisions now that preserve Great Salt Lake’s benefits and mitigate its negative impacts into the coming centuries. ” As water journalist John Fleck told me in this recent interview, states and localities in the American West have actually been surprisingly good at responding to tragedy of the   problems over the past few decades. The Great Salt Lake is going to be an important test case here. Because the last thing anyone should want is to replicate what happened to the Aral Sea.  Further reading  —   Seriously, the disappearance of the Aral Sea is an excellent warning for what happens when you let a   lake go dry.   —   Everyone’s worried the West is running out of water. The reality is more complicated. ", "prop": 0.06337414856875938},

{"article": "After a woman was   and died of her injuries in New Delhi in December 2012, the Indian government tried to set up swift and judicious ways to report and address such crimes. Fast track courts were set up, social workers and police were given sensitization training. Women were told things would be better when they stepped out.   four years and the country is buzzing angrily at how much has not changed. Women bringing in the new year in downtown Bangalore, the country’s cosmopolitan IT hub, were surrounded and groped by mobs of pushing, shoving, handsy men. Photos and videos captured that night show young women trying to push through crowds of up to 300 men pressing in on them. Some of the women were crying, some yelling, others were being defended by their friends. Many of the women said they used their shoes to beat off gropers. A short distance away, an emcee walked out of his event and stumbled upon 25 men threatening a group of women. According to some women on the scene, not only was the harassment frightening, the apathy of cops who looked away and didn’t intervene was worse. In the days that have followed, the official stance on the mass harassment has done somersaults. First the police vowed to punish the offenders and called on the victims to file police complaints. Three days later, the police said they found no street camera footage to support the claims of sexual harassment, although the police commissioner has since said there is ”credible evidence” of the attacks. And then came the remarks of home minister G. Parameshwara, one of the highest ranking officials in the state of Karnataka, of which Bangalore is the capital. He went on record to say: ”Youngsters . .. try to copy the Westerners not only in the mindset but even the dressing. So some disturbance, some girls are harassed, these kind of things do happen.” On January 3, Abu Azmi of Mumbai, the state leader of a political party, said on national TV: ”If my sister or daughter is roaming around on December 31 with random men who aren’t their husband or brother, I don’t think that’s right.” He added, ”If there’s petrol near fire, it will burn. If there is sugar, ants will come.” His words were highlighted in angry tweets. Trisha Shetty, a lawyer, is the   of SheSays, a nonprofit group that educates young women about their rights, especially in the areas of sexual violence. She said the responses from officials were reprehensible. ”We reject this sense of entitlement men have over women’s bodies, sexuality and spaces,” she said. And, she added, the display of such parochial mindsets from people in charge of ensuring safety in public spaces is a huge setback for women. Meanwhile, on social media the #NotAllMen hashtag started to trend the next day defending men who didn’t do it, arguing that women were generalizing their anger. Japleen Pasricha, who runs the Feminism in India platform, was a critic of #NotAllMen tweets: ”The #NotAllMen tag detracted from the conversation, hijacked the narrative, and moved it away from how to deal with what’s happening. We’re not saying all men do this, but we do know all women are harassed.” To counter it, Feminism In India and Pasricha dusted off the globally used #YesAllWomen hashtag. Their tweet inviting Indian women to share their stories of public harassment, assault and abuse has been retweeted more than 900 times, with at least 1, 000 responses, says Pasricha. Sharing stories publicly may not change too many minds (although one Twitter troll changed his handle to ”I’m sorry” after being taken to task for sexism) m says Pasricha, ”But, mainly we wanted to take the narrative back.” A petition has been floated demanding unconditional apologies from the politicians, and on January 21 solidarity marches will be held in seven cities: Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Pune and Kolkata, organized and supported by 18 organizations, including Take Back the Night and Why Loiter, under the umbrella hashtag #IWillGoOut2017, Will a march make a difference? In late 2012 and early 2013, protests and vigils took place across the country, but soon other issues overtook demands for women’s safety. ”In the wake of the Nirbhaya case [the 2012 rape] the nation was in fervor  —   taking to the streets, debating on various media outlets,” the organizers of the #IWillGoOut march told me in a collectively authored email. ”Some blamed her and her partner. Some fathers vowed to never send their daughters out again because the world was cruel to them. Is this how we deal with assault? By limiting the freedoms and mobility of half the population?” What’s more, cases of sexual attack are on the rise. Data shows that police reports of assault on women rose 92 percent from 42, 968 in 2011 to 82, 422 in 2015. But conviction rates declined by 5 percent. In Karnataka, the rate of conviction is 1. 2 percent. Sukriti Gupta,   at the Academy For Earth Sustainability, an environment education organization, said she’s still hopeful of making a difference. ”I strongly believe reclaiming public space, making our voices heard, is important to remind and encourage others, especially women, that there is a support system out there  —   that we have a right and a place in our country, at night, regardless of what we wear.” Plus, she said, ”the visual nature of marches can cross socioeconomic barriers and provide food for thought for those who are normally not engaged in   press such as women and young girls living in more conservative families and slum areas.” The organizers of the march told me that the Bangalore harassment was not an isolated incident: ”It is a visible part of systemic inequality that prevents, hinders and shames half the population from moving around their cities, their homes. It is time to stake a claim in our landscape and our rights to own the streets and go out!” India’s tourism minister expressed the opposite perspective in August 2016. After high profile rape cases across the country, some involving foreign tourists, in August 2016 Mahesh Sharma advised foreign visitors to avoid wearing skirts and venturing out at night: ”For their own safety, women foreign tourists should not wear short dresses and skirts,” he said, because ”Indian culture is different from the Western.” This attitude toward safety seems to have been a contentious issue even a century ago. The Twitter account for the Why Loiter group has shared a quote from 1905 that mocks how keeping women safe means locking them up rather than changing or punishing the attitudes that endanger them.", "prop": 0.04205676988976339},
{"article": "Our former colleague Eliana Johnson has a short profile of the guy launching American Affairs, the forthcoming intellectual journal of Trumpism, rising   from the ashes of the Journal of American Greatness. A    conservative wunderkind is out to intellectualize Trumpism, the amorphous ideology that lifted its namesake to the presidency in November. Until recently, the idea itself was an oxymoron, since Trumpism has consisted in large part of the  ’s ruthless evisceration of the country’s intellectual elite. But next month, Julius Krein, a 2008 Harvard graduate who has spent most of his admittedly short career in finance, is launching a journal of public policy and political philosophy with an eye toward laying the intellectual foundation for the Trump movement. If his nerdy swagger is any indication, he has big ambitions: He noted wryly that he is  —   “coincidentally”  —   the same age that William F. Buckley Jr. was six decades ago when he founded National Review, the magazine that became the flagship of the conservative movement. But other than that, I’m glad someone is doing this. The conservative movement needs more   not less. I agree with Yuval Levin, who tells Johnson, “Not nearly enough of that is happening around the changes we’ve seen in this election. ” Also, a thing like “Trumpism” deserves an intellectual effort to define it in   terms. That said, I’m skeptical of some of Krein’s larger ambitions. Johnson reports that American Affairs will “launch in both a print and digital version, and a substantial portion of the funding will come from Krein himself. He said donors to traditional conservative institutions have been ’surprisingly’ receptive to his pitch, though he declined to name the additional contributors. ” How receptive could the donors be if the editor is largely  ? It’s even harder when Donald Trump is your lodestar. I’m quoted in the piece: “It will take a good deal of time for even Trump’s most gifted apologists to craft an intellectually or ideologically coherent theme or narrative to his program,” said Jonah Goldberg, a senior editor of National Review. “Trump boasts that he wants to be unpredictable and insists that he will make all decisions on a    basis. That’s a hard approach for an intellectual journal to defend in every particular. ” My point there is you beat ideas with ideas. You can challenge the “theoretical foundations of ‘conservatism’” (perhaps starting with an explanation for why you put it in scare quotes) or you can defend a theoretical program. Unless you’re just going to defend Pragmatism   the instinctual, infallible, wisdom of Donald Trump in all cases, you’ll either need your own theory of the case or you’ll need to allow for writers willing to criticize Trump outright. There’s nothing wrong with that, except American Affairs is being launched to defend Trump and Trumpism. If Krein isn’t willing to tolerate serious criticism of Trump in furtherance of Trumpism, then he should skip the journal and go work directly for Sean Spicer. If he does allow criticism, (a) good for him and (b) he should be prepared for his   journal to be denounced by Trump himself. While I am perfectly comfortable saying that Krein is no William F. Buckley  —   because no one is  —   I would note that great magazines and journals are often born out of such chaos and internal contradictions. Irving Kristol and Daniel Bell founded The Public Interest (which was more of an inspiration for neoconservatives than was The National Interest, contrary to what Eliana wrote). But they had some pretty profound disagreements, causing Bell to walk away early on. Irving Kristol solved these, and similar, problems by making the PI a magazine for writers, not editors. At National Review we had an even more stormy beginning, with libertarians, Machiavellians, Ultramontane Catholics, Straussian philosophers, social conservatives of every flavor, and a wide variety of   squabbling and debating everything under the sun. The creative tension was invaluable in forming the foundation of modern conservatism. Bill Buckley made it work through sheer force of personality. We didn’t have a fan in the Oval Office until Ronald Reagan. The New Republic (now a pale shadow of its former self) was always at its best when it was at war with itself. I grew up on it in the 1980s, when many of the editors hated one another’s guts and fought over Reagan, the Contras, etc. The magazine’s early years were even more chaotic. The New Republic was founded, according to Walter Lippmann (a   New Republic staffer as well as an aide to Woodrow Wilson) “to explore and develop and apply the ideas which had been advertised by Theodore Roosevelt when he was the leader of the Progressive party. ” Pretty much TR was to The New Republic as Trump is to American Affairs. But when Wilson was elected, and started leading us to war, The New Republic was all over the map because of disagreements among the editors. Eventually, their old ideological hero Teddy Roosevelt charged into the offices of The New Republic like a Bull Moose to chew them out for their disloyalty. Realizing he couldn’t set them straight, TR shouted that the magazine was “a negligible sheet, run by two anemic Gentiles and two uncircumcised Jews. ” If Trump tweets something like that at Krein  Co. he’ll know he’s on his way to “greatness. ”,", "prop": 0.5910609071490633},

Tillerson said Washington is discussing North Korea with all of its allies, and seeing some response from China, its biggest trading partner. He said North Korea would top the agenda at  next week’s   talks between U. S. and Chinese officials. Tillerson said the United States would have to work with other countries to deny North Korea access to basics such as oil and will have to consider whether to impose sanctions on those doing business with North Korea. ”We are in a stage where we are moving into this next effort of, ’Are we going to have to, in effect, start taking secondary  sanctions because countries we have provided information to  have not, or are unwilling, or don’t have the ability to do that? ’” Tillerson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Because the United States has no trade with the North, its strongest way to impose economic pressure is through ”secondary sanctions” that threaten companies from third countries with losing access to the U. S. market if they deal with Pyongyang. TIES WITH RUSSIA AT A LOW Asked whether the United States wanted to see an   global embargo to deny exports of petroleum and other products to North Korea, Tillerson said that this would only work if Russia and China, the North’s main suppliers, cooperated. Tillerson repeated his view that U. S. relations with Russia  were at an all   and still deteriorating. Ties have been strained by differences over Syria, Ukraine and allegations, denied by Moscow, of Russian efforts to influence the 2016 U. S. presidential election. He said the administration was trying to find a way to   a working relationship, notably on Syria. It took years of diplomacy with Russia and China to achieve consensus among major powers to impose the sanctions on Iran and a similar result with the North seems unlikely given Beijing’s reluctance to destabilize its neighbors. Asked if China had lived up to its pledges to crack down on the North, Tillerson said its actions had been ”uneven,” but added: ”They have taken steps, visible steps that we can confirm. We are in discussions with them about entities inside of China.” The purpose of Tillerson’s appearance, his first of four congressional hearings this week, was to discuss the budget. In all, the Trump proposal cuts about 32 percent from U. S. diplomacy and aid budgets, or nearly $19 billion. Committee members, including some of Trump’s fellow Republicans, spoke sharply against the plan. Republicans control both houses of Congress, which sets the federal government budget. Separately, 16 retired senior generals and other   officers said they would submit joint testimony to the Senate on Wednesday about the importance of foreign aid to national security.

{"article": "The    that has inflicted the most lasting and politically lethal damage to Hillary Clinton and her campaign, Clinton Cash, came from the investigative pen of Breitbart Senior    Peter Schweizer. [Bloomberg Politics editor Mark Halperin hails Clinton Cash as “the Right’s greatest success story. ” And that is why Hillary Clinton’s campaign has decided to throw a   temper tantrum aimed at lashing out at the news organization behind the Clinton Cash juggernaut, one that has coalesced into media outlets across the political spectrum calling for the Clinton Foundation’s immediate closure.  Indeed, Hillary’s latest desperate attempt to label 31 million Breitbart readers “racist” is easier to understand when viewed against the blistering devastation Clinton Cash —  in all its varied forms —  has inflicted on her campaign. Clinton Cash debuted last year at number two on the New York Times bestsellers list, remained fixed there for ten weeks, is currently on the NYT paperback list for three weeks running, is currently #1 on the NYT graphic novel bestseller list, and has been viewed nearly 3. 5 million on YouTube in its documentary form in just the last several weeks. The progressive MSNBC said the film is “devastating” and “powerfully connects the dots. ” The liberal Guardian says it’s “  …    a powerful message, one that is clearly designed to stir up trouble at the convention at just the moment when Clinton should be reveling in her victory in the Democratic race. ” Time Magazine calls it “a scathing broadside aimed at persuading liberals [and] is likely to leave    Clinton supporters who see it feeling more unsure about casting a vote for her. ” The film’s producer, of course, is former Breitbart News Executive Chairman and current Donald Trump campaign CEO Stephen K. Bannon. Ergo, Team Hillary’s latest attempt to trash Breitbart Nation and its 31 million monthly readers as racist. Put simply, the tsunami of verified and confirmed Clinton Cash revelations are now engulfing Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Nearly a dozen progressive media outlets and journalists have joined the deafening chorus of voices calling for Hillary’s embattled and corrupt Clinton Foundation to stop serving as a favor factory for foreign oligarchs and to shut down operations immediately. The Associated Press reports that over half of Hillary Clinton’s nongovernmental meetings at the State Department took place with Clinton Foundation donors. Emails uncovered by Judicial Watch reveal Hillary’s top aide Huma Abedin coordinating foreign favors with the Clinton Foundation, including greasing requests for billionaire   oligarch Gilbert Chagoury, a former business associate of the late billionaire fugitive Marc Rich. On Wednesday, the Democrat presidential nominee went on CNN to try and tamp down calls for her foundation to close. Liberal CNN host Anderson Cooper asked Clinton, “Why was it okay for the Clinton Foundation to accept foreign donations when you were secretary of state, but it wouldn’t be okay if you were president?” Clinton replied, “No, no. You know, look, Anderson, I know there’s a lot of smoke and there’s no fire. ” Hillary Clinton’s embarrassing and anemic response explains why she’s refused to hold a single press conference over the last 264 days. But it also underscored a deeper, more vexing problem for her campaign: there are no good answers to the myriad Clinton Cash revelations that continue to bedevil her candidacy. As Schweizer detailed last week, Hillary has still yet to answer even basic questions about her State Dept. auctioning policies to foreign Clinton Foundation donors: Hillary Clinton has not answered why her State Dept. approved the transfer of 20% of all U. S. uranium to Russia while not disclosing to the Obama administration that nine investors in that uranium deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation. Hillary Clinton has not answered why her brother, Tony Rodham, sat on the board of a company that received a rare “gold exploitation permit” from the Haitian government while she was dispersing billions of U. S. taxpayer dollars in Haiti earthquake disaster relief. Hillary Clinton has not answered why she hid $2. 35 million in Clinton Foundation donations from the head of one of the Russian government’s uranium companies. Hillary Clinton has not answered why she has yet to release the names of the 1, 100 foreign Clinton Foundation donors that both Bloomberg and the Washington Post confirm remain secret. Hillary Clinton has not answered why it was appropriate for Bill Clinton to deliver a $500, 000 speech in Moscow paid for by a   bank while she led the   Russian reset as Sec. of State —  a Clinton Cash revelation so egregious, that even the progressive New Yorker magazine was left to ponder, “Why was Bill Clinton taking any money from a bank linked to the Kremlin while his wife was Secretary of State?” Hillary Clinton has not answered why her current campaign chairman, John Podesta, sat on the board of a company alongside Russian officials that received $35 million from Rusnano, Vladimir Putin’s funding apparatus. Until Hillary’s campaign can concoct answers to those and other questions, they have decided the best they can do is “run out the clock” and label anyone who holds different ideas or opinions as racist. It’s a sad and desperate denouement to Hillary Clinton’s unprecedented Clinton Foundation corruptions.", "prop": 0.995128217802128},
{"article": " (CNN) The use of a robot to kill the man who authorities say fatally shot five Dallas police officers has drawn attention in part because it’s the first time police have used robots in such a manner. Below is a series of questions that I have been asked frequently and preliminary answers. The facts remain incomplete, so these are preliminary thoughts.  What happened? In the wake of the shooting of the Dallas police officers Thursday night during a peaceful protest, police cornered the shooter     Micah Xavier Johnson    in a parking garage. After an   standoff that included exchanges of gunfire, they used a robot to deliver an explosive that killed the gunman.    Why did they use it? ”We saw no other option but to use our bomb robot and place a device on its extension for it to detonate where the subject was,” Dallas Police Chief David Brown said at a news conference Friday morning. ”Other options would have exposed our officers to grave danger.” What robot was used? The system has been reported as a Northrop Grumman Remotec Andros, which is a   bomb disposal robot commonly used by police, military and other first responders around the world. It is wheeled, weighs around 220 kg (485 pounds) and mounts various sensors and a robotic arm with grippers.  Why is this being reported as a big deal? This is the first use of a robotic system by the police in a deliberately lethal manner.  Are there parallels or past precedents by the police? Robots are used all the time by police bomb squads forces around the world in bomb disposals. They are also frequently used in surveillance roles by SWAT teams and the like. They have been used in standoffs with armed gunmen in a variety of examples, from helping to figure out where the gunman is hiding to delivering pizza to the gunman and hostages during negotiations when a person wasn’t allowed in. But none of these involved delivering lethal force.  The closest parallel I am aware of was a case in 2011, when police in Tennessee strapped tear gas grenades to a robot that then accidentally started a fire in a mobile home. This doesn’t seem a great parallel, as it does not reflect a decision deliberately to use the robot to kill. Another parallel would be the 1985 standoff in Philadelphia between law enforcement and the MOVE group. Manned police helicopters dropped two small explosive devices on the roof to try to open a breach into the building below where the group was bunkered in. Instead, the building caught fire, killing 11 in the blaze, and burning down many neighboring buildings. Again here, the parallel isn’t a perfect one. While it did involve a bomb, there was no robot, nor was it a deliberate use in the way authorities used the robot in Dallas.  What about in war? The best parallel that I am aware of is a case that I wrote about in my 2009 book ”Wired for War.” A U. S. Army soldier discussed how his unit in Iraq in the mid 2000s was equipped with a surveillance robot known as a MARCBOT. This is a remotely operated surveillance robot, equipped with a mast holding a small camera, not the kind used in Dallas. It costs about $8, 000. Their unit used the robotic system for roles like checkpoint duty if there was a car that was suspected of being a car bomb, they would send the robot for a close look, rather than a risk one of their people.  When they faced off with an armed insurgent holed up in an alley, the soldier told of how they came up with an ad hoc answer. They   the robot with an explosive device (literally   a claymore mine on it) and drove it down the alley to kill the insurgent, rather than risking a soldier. Why would the police have a bomb with them? It has not been reported which type of explosive was used, but it is important to note that it was clearly not the common image of a ”bomb” like the type dropped by an  . Police SWAT teams have small explosive charges that they use for breaches (to blow open a locked door or a hole in the wall to get around a gunman behind a door) while bomb squads sometimes will place  small explosive charges beside a known or suspected bomb to detonate it in a safe manner.  Update: Dallas PD has confirmed that the explosive device on the robot was a   C4 plastic explosive plus ”Det” cord, fitting with the analysis above. How does this link to the ”killer robots” debate?  While there are links to the discussion on the future of killer robots, known as LAWS (lethal autonomous weapons systems) there are also three important differences to keep in mind. First, this was not an autonomous robot both the robot and the explosive were remotely operated. Second, this was not a designed weapons system. There are many ground robots under development that are armed with weapons like machine guns and missile launchers, from the prototypes of the US MAARS to the Chinese Sharp Claw. But this was the case of using an older robot designed for something else. And, third, the concerns driving the ”killer robots” debate center on whether we can prevent the unleashing of   robots on the battlefield, for which militaries around the world are beginning to establish plans and doctrines. The debate is driven by a concern that such a future might cause both greater civilian harm and a lack of accountability.  By contrast, this was an ad hoc use, just like the case in Iraq. There is no doctrine that planned this out, no training manuals that police were following, nor development programs for this use. It also doesn’t appear to have risked civilian harm or raised accountability concerns of the kind that motivate the killer robots debate. There are links to that debate but they are more about the many different directions robot use might go to next. But doesn’t it portend a future of lethal police robots? It is too early to draw that conclusion. An important first use of robots in a lethal way by police was established. But you can counter whether that important first will open the floodgates with two opposite points. First, police forces around the world are already equipped with this type of robotic system. So it can’t cause mass spread of the technology since that spread was already under way. And, second, important precedents of use aren’t always followed. They can either prove to be exceptional circumstances or the public   police decide against them in the aftermath. Take the case of the 1985 MOVE standoff police helicopters dropped bombs, but that didn’t become a common practice in the years since.  What we can confidently conclude is that we will see greater and greater use of robotics in all sorts of roles, whether it be by the military, law enforcement, or just the rest of us in civilian life. Indeed, some 80 plus countries already have robotics in their militaries, while companies that range from Google to Tesla to Uber to Ford are planning on a future of ”  cars.” In policing, the robotics trend has been moving towards greater use of drones in surveillance roles, from smaller ones that might be used by individual units to large ones that could monitor an entire neighborhood or city. The key here is to distinguish the decision of unmanning a system from arming it. Just as manned police planes or helicopters are not armed (police don’t fly Apache attack helicopters or  ) the trend towards their unmanning doesn’t somehow mean they have to be armed. So, too, manned police ground vehicles, whether they be patrol cars or even military surplus MRAPS don’t mount cannons or machine guns like their military equivalent neither do the unmanned versions have to be armed by definition.  Before this incident, when it came to arming robotic systems in a law enforcement role, most of the discussion has been of ones using ”less than lethal” weapons. At a number of trade shows, robotic systems have been displayed that mount tasers and tear gas to China’s controversial Anbot, which is a police bot designed to operate autonomously and equipped with an electroshock device similar to a cattle prod. These, of course, prompt great debate that brings together elements of the robotics argument with the question over whether ”less than lethal” weapons actually lead to abuse (think about the debate over Tasers  they arguably save lives, yet might be used more often). Did the Dallas Police do the right thing? I’m not going to second guess them. The information isn’t all in, emotions are high, and the best judges of that are going to be experts on SWAT team tactics and lawyers that specialize in police use of force issues. In no way, shape, or form is any of this a condemnation. Indeed, it is the opposite. My reaction is similar to the one I had to the case mentioned above in Iraq I wasn’t there, but can certainly understand and, even more, empathize with what the people on the scene decided to do. At the same time, my analytic side can recognize that this is a big issue that has provoked debate.  Is this another sign of the ”militarization” of police in the U. S.? I have a hard time making that connection now. The debate over the militarization of the police seems to turn on 1) the use of equipment designed for war, often provided in surplus from the U. S. military, and 2) in a manner that is intimidating or threatening to the public.  In this incident, the technology is not one that is only used in war and it was not used in a way that was targeting the broader public indeed it was the opposite. Remember, the police in Dallas who were shot and killed were there protecting peaceful protesters, not intimidating them. Images from the scene beforehand showed police and protesters smiling together. In turn, when violence struck, the police on the scene bravely moved protesters to safety, while the media reported that protesters helped police find the shooter. The police and protesters were in it together so we, in turn, should not let people try to exploit the tragedy as a means to divide.  What are the overall issues at hand? Obviously, this use of robotic technology in a lethal manner was a big first and one can imagine pathways that take you into those concerns. Yet, even though I am someone who has written widely on robotics, the events of this last week leave me more concerned over other trends. The issue of robotics may be new, but the ease of mass violence in our society, the worsening of   relations, and all the challenges of race in America are problems that were there well before the tragic events in Minnesota, Louisiana, and now Texas. These are what we must face, and, most importantly, face together.", "prop": 0.33235179038963153},

{"article": " With the debacle of health care reform in the rearview window, conservatives in Congress and the White House are turning their sights on President Barack Obama’s financial regulations. All indications are that the GOP is more unified in how they want to go about “repealing and replacing” these regulations  —   most of which were passed as part of the   Act in 2010.    For the past six years, these reforms have provided key protections to consumers and stability to the banking system by protecting consumers. They’ve made banks more resilient and created stability in the capital markets.  Expect Republicans, as in the case of the health care bill, to attack the regulations by way of the budget: specifically, through the “budget reconciliation” process that eliminates the threat of a Democratic filibuster. Contrary to many headlines, the executive orders President Donald Trump has released so far related to banking regulations do little more than call for reviews. Reviews are the sort of thing a   administration would normally have quietly done during the transition. True, Trump can do damage to financial reform when he appoints regulators hostile to enforcing the law. But undoing the regulations won’t be as simple as flipping a switch, or swapping out one set of political appointees for another. There would have been no point in passing something like   if a Republican president could overturn it by fiat.    It is unlikely, also, that Congress will overturn   with a big bill. The Senate is the crucial threshold, and the legislation Republicans have floated is so aggressive it’s unlikely it can get 60 votes. The CHOICE Act that has been proposed by Republicans in the House would repeal or dismantle virtually every part of   from the Volcker Rule (which prevents commercial banks from making certain kinds of speculative trades) to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to the ability to prevent a collapsing financial firm from bringing down the broader economy.     But the CHOICE Act goes still further, splitting the Federal Reserve in half and preventing it from coordinating financial regulations and monetary policy, something that will make bubbles more likely  —   and more dangerous to the economy. It would reduce the deference given to regulatory agencies, making regulations harder to pass, and harder to interpret. Republicans did not seek any Democrat input on the bill, and as such it’s unlikely to gain the support it needs to overcome a filibuster. Bloomberg’s Matt Levine called the bill “a kitchen sink of grievances. ” Yet there’s a way around the filibuster  —   one that will be familiar to those who have closely followed the health care debate. For years, conservatives in Congress have been eyeing the pieces of   that can be repealed through budget reconciliation, a process that only requires a simple majority vote in the Senate (if the changes follow a complicated set of rules related to spending). This poses the biggest danger to financial reform in the next year.    Where financial regulations are concerned, Republicans’ top targets may surprise you. Many knowledgeable observers, such as Ben Bernanke, point to the ability of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to take over and   a financial firm on the eve of collapse  —   an ability created by    —   as a signal achievement of financial reform. Such powers would have prevented Lehman Brothers from going into bankruptcy in an uncontrolled manner, as it did in 2008, and would have thereby taken significant stress off the financial system. Yet these powers are in the crosshairs.  Many also argue that the risks of lending and borrowing among investment banks in the capital markets  —     “shadow banking”  —   carry the potential to produce panics, runs, and other crises. Regulators have made progress in limiting such risks. Yet Republicans want to bring this kind of oversight to a halt.  Republicans love to hate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau The biggest target of all, however, is likely to be the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was created to ensure that consumers have a dedicated financial regulator on their side. In its short life, the CFPB has been a remarkable success. It was essential in extracting a $100 million settlement from Wells Fargo for creating fake accounts for its customers that they did not want, then charging them fees for those accounts. It has provided billions of dollars in relief through legal actions against companies that used deceptive practices to sell financial products.     Perhaps most importantly, the bureau has brought transparency and accountability to previously opaque markets like consumer credit reporting, making clear just how much putting that new computer on your credit card will cost you in the long run. It has clarified for consumers the fine print aggressively wielded by nonbank debt collectors, mortgage and student debt servicers, and   colleges. These are markets where consumers are often not in a position to rectify injustices themselves. Conservatives have argued, however, that the CFPB is unaccountable and     —   that it lacks any of the administrative checks that accompany other regulatory agencies. Rep. Jeb Hensarling ( ) chair of the House Financial Services Committee, has called it the “most powerful and least accountable” agency in American history. That’s the same exact wording used by Mitt Romney while running for President in in 2012. But this supposed unaccountability is a canard. The CFPB is structured exactly like the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) another banking regulator  —   one that the CFPB is designed to complement and counterbalance. Like the Comptroller of the Currency, the CFPB has a single director, a dedicated funding stream, and a clear mission.  The similarity between the two regulatory agencies is no accident. (Indeed, the Senate Report on the   Act says the CFPB’s policies and “provisions are modeled on similar statutes governing the Office of the Comptroller. ”) In the   to the financial crisis, the OCC and other federal regulators put bank profitability over safeguards for consumers. The CFPB wields a similar level of powers but has a mandate to fight for consumers. It was unclear whether President Trump would fire CFPB Director Richard Cordray upon taking office. The legal case to do so was nonexistent, though many prominent Republicans encouraged him to. For now, Cordray has his job, which is set to naturally end in July of 2018, though the CFPB is still a target. We can expect Republicans to use reconciliation to dramatically reduce the budget, and by extension the effectiveness, of the CFPB. A move to keep “shadow banking” in the shadows The next target for Republicans will be the mechanism we have for dealing with risks posed by the overall financial sector. One of the lessons of the financial crisis is that it’s possible for the risks associated with traditional banking  —   panics, bank runs, and cascading failures of institutions  —   to be present in activities and institutions that aren’t traditional banks.     In the aftermath of Lehman Brothers’ collapse, investors in money market mutual funds, for instance, began rapidly pulling their funds. Soon, money market funds with no known Lehman exposure were having panics; in one week, investors in such funds withdrew $349 billion. This was the beginning of an It’s a Wonderful Life style banking run, but one that was in the capital markets of Wall Street instead of your neighborhood bank. Rapid deregulation had led to a situation in which large commercial banks like Citigroup had investment banking subsidiaries within them that were poorly regulated relative to traditional banking.   has fought for a consistent and clear regulatory regime for this type of credit creation. Republicans, however, don’t share this goal: The American Enterprise Institute recently ran a headline flatly stating “Shadow banks are not a source of systemic risk. ” Republicans plan on instituting    regulation reflecting that assumption.  The way Republicans plan on achieving this dubious goal is by reducing the funding for the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) a council of regulators whose job is to monitor the financial system, while also slashing the budget of the newly created Office for Financial Research (OFR). The Financial Stability Oversight Council requires financial firms that pose an unusually high risk of collapse, panic, and uncertainty to the economy to follow tougher regulations  —   including straightforward regulations followed by regular commercial banks. Republicans will also weaken the FSOC by appointing people to the council who share the ideology that there are no special risks in this sector. This upcoming attack is unfortunate because, as Amias Gerety, former Treasury assistant secretary for Financial Institutions under President Obama, describes in a recent paper, there’s been significant progress in reducing systemic banking risks. Bets that were hidden off the balance sheet of major financial firms have been put back on the books, making them clearer to investors and forcing banks to fund themselves with enough capital to handle the attendant risks.  New capital requirements require firms to have enough liquid funds to survive a crisis and make required payments to other firms. The riskier money market funds have been reorganized so they now have a value that fluctuates, which reduces the incentives for investors to be the first out the door like they did after Lehman failed. (Before, investors tended to bolt when money market funds “broke the buck”  —   when the share of a fund purchased per dollar dipped below $1. The new system makes it clearer that such funds, which tend to have low risk and low returns, aren’t guarantees.) However, by going after the funding of the regulators designed to handle future risks in capital markets, progress could be stopped dead.    Some institutions are indeed “too big to fail. ” But that doesn’t fit GOP ideology. Republicans will also try to use budget reconciliation to kill the funding and emergency powers given to the FDIC to deal with a failing financial institution, should the Lehman Brothers scenario recur. One reason is that many influential Republicans think, once again, that there’s simply no systemic problem that needs fixing. When Financial Services Committee Chair Jeb Hensarling introduced his CHOICE Act to roll back   he answered a question about the “too big to fail” issue by saying that letting big banks fail, as the government did in the case of Lehman, posed no problems: “Although it was painful, and somewhat chaotic, in many respects, those in the bankruptcy arena would tell you, the Lehman bankruptcy, to some extent, worked as it should have worked. ” But there are good reasons why we shouldn’t simply let financial institutions like Lehman Brothers go bankrupt, especially during a crisis. Bankruptcy is slow while a financial crisis is quick. Bankruptcy isn’t designed to stop financial runs or keep operations running, and it is certainly not designed to quickly coordinate across the vast complexity of financial firms that exist in dozens of countries.  Access to a secure line of funding is necessary to keep crucial banking functions running  —   and that can be difficult to secure during a bankruptcy, especially if the financial markets are chaotic. A random bankruptcy judge won’t have any experience with the financial firm in advance. What’s more, both the bankruptcy judge and Congress will face huge political pressure to resort to bailouts to prevent a crisis. To handle this,   provides the FDIC with a special power to take over and gradually shutter financial firms in case of emergencies.  It’s called Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) which oversees what Barney Frank calls “death panels for banks. ” Such liquidations are designed to function in some ways like bankruptcies, but they’re executed by regulators, who will have great familiarity with the industry and the firm. They can be done on the eve of a failure, which prevents managers from gambling to try to fix themselves  —   creating new problems that put the financial system at risk.  The FDIC can adjudicate claims quickly under this receivership, including putting a hold on derivatives and other complicated financial instruments. It can create a bridge company that allows for the transfer important entities to a new company. By targeting the parent company of a financial firm’s structure and forcing it to prepare for failure in advance, it can handle international scale and complex scope of financial institutions in a way bankruptcy cannot.     The liquidation authority has a dedicated funding stream that allows the FDIC to borrow against the failing firm’s assets in a time of crisis. Though taxpayer money is always recovered first by statute, the CBO scored this power as having a budgetary cost. This score is controversial because CBO assumed money would be lent within the   period but not recovered until afterward. Thus, under the complex reconciliation rules, Republicans can change and perhaps remove this power.   can be weakened through neglect, and the regulators President Trump puts into place are certainly likely to try that strategy. But the main danger is funding. Paul Ryan’s goal in the next two years is to recreate the federal government using a narrow majority and Senate budget rules to dodge the filibuster. This approach is dangerous when it comes to financial reform, because instead of creating a system that works for the overall economy, the proposals may well amount to a    of whatever fits this procedural trick.  Rapid change is the strength of this approach, but it would be rapid change in a direction that hurts consumers  —   and it makes a repeat of the 2007 to 2008 financial meltdown more likely.

{"article": " Fired FBI Director James B. Comey said President Trump told him at the White House “I need loyalty, I expect loyalty’’ in their private White House dinner conversation in January, according to written testimony prepared by Comey.  In written remarks submitted to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Wednesday  —   a day before his   testimony  —   Comey said he remembered nine separate private conversations with President Trump. Three were in person and six on the phone.  Comey said the president called him at lunchtime on Jan. 27 to invite him to dinner.  “It was unclear from the conversation who else was going to be at the dinner, although I assumed there would be others,’’ Comey wrote. “It turned out to be just the two of us, seated at a small oval table in the center of the Green Room. Two Navy stewards waited on us, only entering the room to serve food and drinks. ’’ The president began the conversation, Comey wrote, by asking him if he wanted to stay on as FBI Director, “which I found strange because he had already told me twice in earlier conversations that he hoped I would stay, and I had assured him that I intended to. ’’       (Bastien   Washington Post)   The president replied, according to Comey, that lots of people wanted his job and “he would understand if I wanted to walk away. ’’ Comey’s instincts, he wrote, were that both the setting and the conversation “meant the dinner was, at least in part, an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship. That concerned me greatly, given the FBI’s traditionally independent status in the executive branch. ’’  The president then made his demand for loyalty.  “I didn’t move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed,’’ Comey wrote. “We simply looked at each other in silence. The conversation then moved on, but he returned to the subject near the end of our dinner. ’’  [Read Comey’s prepared remarks for his upcoming testimony]  When prompted again on the subject of loyalty, Comey said he replied, “You will always get honesty from me. ’’  Comey said that once before Trump’s inauguration, and again at the January dinner, he assured the president that he was not personally under investigation. He also told the president later on that he had shared that information with congressional leaders.  In essence, Comey’s written testimony confirms a key claim that Trump has made  —   that three times, Comey told the president he was not under investigation. But it also paints a portrait of a strained, awkward relationship between the two men, in which the president frequently expressed his displeasure about the Russia probe in ways that alarmed the FBI director. The written testimony also recounts a    conversation the two men had on February 14  —   Valentine’s Day  —   at the Oval Office, where many senior officials had gathered for a counterterrorism briefing. After the meeting, the president asked everyone to leave. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and senior adviser Jared Kushner lingered in the room, but the president told them to leave, too, according to Comey.  When the door by the grandfather clock closed, Comey wrote, the president said “I want to talk about Mike Flynn’’  —   the former national security adviser who was forced out after disclosures about his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the U. S. Sergey Kislyak. Flynn had resigned a day earlier. “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go,’’ the president said, according to Comey. The FBI director replied only that “he is a good guy. ’’ In that conversation, the president repeatedly complained to the FBI director about leaks, and Comey said he agreed with him about the harm caused by leaks of classified information.  Comey said he understood the president to be asking for him to “drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador in December. I did not understand the president to be talking about the broader investigation into Russia or possible links to his campaign. ’’ The former FBI director wrote that he found the conversation “very concerning, given the FBI’s role as an independent investigative agency. ’’ Later, Comey complained to Sessions that he should not have been left alone with the president, and Sessions did not reply, according to the written testimony. Then, in late March, Trump called Comey at the FBI. In that conversation, the president called the Russia probe “a cloud’’ hanging over his ability to lead the country. He also expressed continued frustration that unsubstantiated allegations in a private dossier about him had become public, including lurid claims of sexual activity while in Russia. “He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he had been recorded when in Russia,’’ Comey wrote. “He asked what we could do to ‘lift the cloud.’ I responded that we were investigating the matter as quickly as we could, and that there would be great benefit, if we didn’t find anything, to our having done the work well. He agreed, but then   the problems this was causing him,’’ Comey wrote. After that phone call with the president, Comey said he called acting deputy attorney general Dana Boente to tell him what was discussed, and “await his guidance. ’’ Comey said he never heard back from Boente.  Then, on April 11, Comey wrote, the president called him and asked him what he had done about getting out word that he was not personally under investigation. The president told him “the cloud’’ of the probe was interfering with his ability to do his job. “I have been very loyal to you, very loyal; we had that thing you know,’’ Trump told Comey, according to the written testimony. “I did not reply or ask him what he meant by ‘that thing. ’’’ He added: “That was the last time I spoke with President Trump. ’’ ", "prop": 0.15893524495077205},
{"article": "Lights, camera, Beckham. This is the  “Entertainment Tonight”  Six world that Odell Beckham Jr. and the Giants live in  —   a New York sports world that now revolves around him and Aaron Judge, the brightest stars in our constellation. Show’dell played Tuesday in East Rutherford, N. J. And Show’dell longs to play for the rest of his career in the only place that can effectively harbor his mushrooming fame. I asked him this question Tuesday at mandatory Giants minicamp: What was your reaction when John Mara said that he wants you to be a Giant for life? “I think we’re on the same page there,” Beckham said. “Obviously this is one of the best organizations in the league, and I would love to be here for the rest of my life. ” And he should know the New York Post will be with him every step of the way  —   every false step and every touchdown dance step, however he chooses to emblazon us on his cleats, whether his advisers and sycophants like it or not. For Beckham, for the Giants, this all boils down to a matter of trust. The Giants trust that Beckham will grow up then show up as the best receiver in the NFL. Beckham trusts that the Giants will make him the   receiver in the game no later than before the start of the 2018 season, and my instincts tell me that there is an understanding between the sides that a   will get done. Beckham   with his OTA No’dell, and is shrewd enough not to bite the hand that will be feeding him with a holdout. “I don’t really think that really proves a point in my opinion,” he said. “I was just really out there [Los Angeles] taking that time for myself to reflect on life and value what’s really important, and to grow, to mature. You should be growing each and every year, each and every day, until the day you leave this earth. ’’ He talked so much about growth during his absence from OTAs  —   growth from this, growth from that, growth from losing in the playoffs and learning and growing just like LeBron James has to learn and grow from losing the NBA Finals —   that you had to look twice to make sure he hadn’t turned into Judge. “I have got some gray hairs now, so I’m starting to get up there,” Beckham joked. “I’ve been trying to read a couple books. ‘The Four Agreements’ is one book that I picked up. There is just four basic principles that are in there, and one of them that you really had to learn was ‘use your words wisely and don’t take anything personal ever,’ and as you kind of get this guideline of this book it starts to help you grow and really mature into who you are as a person. Like I said, I’ve gotten a couple gray hairs and I feel as if I am a little bit wiser. ” Much better if Show’dell doesn’t just tell us, and especially Giants general manager Jerry Reese. “Growth is something that, it’s a lifetime,” Beckham said. “If you stop growing you’re not really aren’t progressing in life, so we all can grow as well, each and every day. ” Eli Manning hardly sounded insulted that Beckham was away catching passes from Johnny Manziel. “I was in that same position years ago and had to go through it, had to mature, had to realize things, and just understand how to handle everything that is kind of thrown at you and I think he is doing a good job doing that,” Manning said. Of course, Manning never hung out with Drake or Khloe Kardashian or Iggy Azalea or Justin Bieber and Trey Songz and   …     so far be it for him to offer Show’dell advice about handling fame. “Obviously, he is at a whole new level.   …     I don’t know if I’m the one to give advice on that, but I think he is doing a good job,” Manning said. Of course, the    Manning mostly sees the    Beckham within the friendly confines of the Quest Diagnostics Center and MetLife Stadium. The Giants never have housed this kind of celebrity before. “The NFL has changed, social media, all that has changed since I have been a New York Giant, and so you do have to understand the different personalities and different mindsets of people and how to adjust and handle them,” Manning said. What the Giants are counting on is Beckham’s football addiction, and his quest to be legendary. He genuinely was happy to be back among his teammates, especially   wide receiver Sterling Shepard. “It was great just to walk into the room,” Beckham said. “Seeing some new faces, but it is really a special bond when you get inside that room and the relationships that you build with each and every one of those guys, and to see young Shep, it just put a smile on my face. He has such a bright future ahead of him and he puts that smile on your face. “It reminds me of when I was young, it was my second year in the league, and you are just so happy to be here and to be happy to do what he is doing, so it is reassuring to see that from him. ” It was reassuring to the Giants to see that Tuesday from Beckham. As a matter of fact, it was reassuring to them to see him at all.", "prop": 0.18657663638949662},
{"article": "Boston Globe and Bloomberg News journalist Joshua Green had some breaking news to share on Thursday’s Breitbart News Daily about the stark difference in negative campaign ads endured by Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in their respective primaries. [To get a sense of how the Republican and Democratic primaries differed, Bloomberg News consulted with a media tracking firm and asked, “How many dollars of negative ads were run versus Donald Trump in the Republican primary, and how many were run against Hillary Clinton?”  “The disparity could not have been more striking,” he said. “  million dollars in ads run against Trump, zero in attack ads run against Clinton. ” Green noted such an imbalance in negative advertising was unprecedented. “Back in 2008, the last time the Democrats had an open primary, you had Hillary Clinton hitting Barack Obama with the famous ‘3 a. m.’ ad, and there was a lot of kind of  ” he recalled. “This time, nothing. No attacks. So essentially, Clinton got through the Democratic primaries unscathed. ” Green thought this was not necessarily good news for the Democrats.  “I think there are two schools of thought on this,” he said, adding: If you talk to Republican strategists, they will say, “Look, Hillary Clinton has had zero dollars in negative ads run against her, and her favorability numbers are only marginally better than Trump’s. Once we start running ads, they’re gonna fall even further, and she’s in real trouble. ” “The Democratic sort of    —   and I do put some stock in this  —   is that, look, it’s better to come out of a primary with your reputation, your political reputation intact,” he continued. “Look what happened to Mitt Romney in 2012, when Newt and Rick Perry branded him a ‘vulture capitalist. ’” SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon noted that Clinton’s Democratic rival Sen. Bernie Sanders went decidedly more negative against her in the final days of his campaign, while 72 percent of his supporters say they do not trust her, leading him to conclude that her political reputation is not intact. He noted Green’s revelation that the lack of primary attack ads against Clinton was as stunning as the complete absence of media questioning she faced for the Clinton Cash revelations. Bannon said that Clinton and her surrogates do not seem   to deal with the trustworthiness issues she was never hit with during the primary, based on some embarrassing stumbles they have made lately.  Green countered by citing Bill Clinton’s   in 1996, and noting, “You don’t necessarily need to be considered trustworthy to get elected president. ” “The problem she has, I would say, is sort of the flip side of the Trump problem,” he suggested. He continued: Trump got through the Republican nomination because Republicans didn’t want to make a lot of the attacks that Hillary is going to make. The flip side for this is the fact that Bernie didn’t attack Hillary on her secret Goldman Sachs speeches, and on this Clinton Foundation stuff, and on the emails, means that we still have five months to go where there is gonna be a candidate who’s gonna raise those issues. Green predicted that if Trump can “show the discipline and the wherewithal to not go berserk attacking, you know, judges with Mexican heritage, and if he can train his fire on the Clinton message that the party wants him to talk about  —   on the Clinton Cash message, basically  —   then I think he could potentially do a lot of damage to her, and you could see those negatives rise even higher. ” “It only takes one thing from Trump, and that is ” he stressed. “It’s the one thing he hasn’t exhibited a lot of. ” “Look, the minute you open your mouth, if you’re Donald Trump, and you talk about Trump University, or a Mexican judge, or something like that, the media are gonna flock like moths to a flame and cover that, and they’re not going to cover Hillary Clinton,” he warned. “This is the big complaint that Republicans justifiably had when the IG report came out on Hillary’s email. Did anybody pay attention to that?” he asked, then answered himself: “Not really because they were so busy talking to Trump about the judge and listening to Trump double down, and triple down, and quadruple down on these attacks. ” Green said he personally found the IG report against Clinton stunning, but the “Trump Effect” causes him to “dominate news coverage,” for better and worse. “We’ve been seeing that since basically last summer,” he observed. “The downside of that is, the media only covers what comes out of Trump’s mouth. And if he’s not talking about the IG report, if he’s not talking about Hillary Clinton’s email, then that’s not going to get the type of    coverage that you want to see happen, if you’re a Republican. ” Bannon envisioned the 2016 election as “the heavyweight title match, in living memory, of two candidates who are both heavyweights and not afraid to go to places other people that maybe have more decorum won’t go. ” “Oh, absolutely, absolutely,” laughed Green. “That’s what’s so fascinating about the race, and that’s the thing that really does scare a lot of Clinton strategists about Trump,” he said. “Any traditional Republican candidate, you basically know the parameters of the possible attacks. With Trump, it could be literally anything, and that’s hard to prepare for. ”  “It’s also hard to drive your own message, if you’re Clinton and the Democrats, because at any moment, Trump could open his mouth and say something that is going to completely wipe out whatever it is that you think you want to talk about,” he added.

{"article": "Entitlement reform might be back in fashion. The House Agriculture Committee just released a lengthy report on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) formerly known as Food Stamps. The report  —   Past, Present,  Future of SNAP  —   is a comprehensive review of the federal government’s costliest food program, which has a projected budget of $82 billion in 2017. Republicans in Congress have been eyeing changes to SNAP, and President Trump may have the chance to sign the first major reforms to this program since 1996. The report is a good balance of accountability and compassion, no doubt gearing up for the usual “you want poor people to starve” resistance from Democrats. Opponents are already lined up not just to challenge any changes but to push for more benefits. James Weill, president of the Food Research and Action Center, an   lobbying group, testified that “benefits are not adequate to get most families through the whole month . . . even though SNAP recipients use a variety of savvy shopping practices to stretch their limited food dollars, such as clipping coupons, using shopping lists, purchasing generic brands, buying in bulk quantities, and shopping at multiple stores” (just like most people). During testimony to the committee last year, Erik Randolph of the Illinois Policy Institute broke down some of the numbers: A single parent in Lake County [Illinois] who earns $12 per hour brings home just over $22, 000 in net pay. However, that same single parent is eligible for an array of welfare benefits [including tax credits, subsidized school lunch for their children, housing assistance and child care services]. When you add up the value of those potential benefits, it comes to an astounding $39, 534, bringing the total net receivables  —   in terms of earned income and benefits  —   to $61, 655. In comparison, suppose you earn $18 per hour, bringing home about $33, 000 in net pay. That is a gain of about $11, 000 in earned income. However, your potential welfare benefits will drop drastically to $5, 236 from $39, 534, for a loss of more than $34, 000. Why would any sane person voluntarily give up $34, 000 in benefits to gain only $11, 000? This could help explain the near      rate, which fell to 62. 7 percent in September. A morass of federal and state agencies that oversee 18 different   programs leads to overlap and waste, another problem the next Congress could tackle. Although SNAP is federally funded, it’s administered at the state level with little coordination between it and other   offices, which sows fertile ground for fraud and misuse. Dave Yost, Ohio’s state auditor, told the committee on October 31 that “  fraud hardens the hearts of good people and deafens their ears to the sound of hunger. For those who hunger, and for those who pay the bill, we owe a greater effort toward integrity. ” While most SNAP beneficiaries are children (68 percent) about 11 percent of recipients are     Adults Without Dependents (ABAWDs) accounting for nearly $10 billion per year in benefits. Some states still have time limit waivers for ABAWDs  —   allowing benefits for longer than the standard three months  —   issued after the recession. Congress will likely push to tighten time limits and for tougher work requirements, which Dr. Ron Haskins of the Brookings Institution says are “modest . . . and do not appear to be rigorously enforced. ” The biggest fight could be over eliminating certain items from eligibility. Taxpayers now subsidize the purchase of lots of food they probably shouldn’t. According to a recent Department of Agriculture survey, soft drinks rank number one on the list of most purchased items with SNAP benefits, to the tune of nearly $360 million per year. Other items that could be on the chopping block include bag snacks (#4 on the list) candy (#11) and ice cream (#15). You can just hear the Democrats now: “Republicans want to take away popsicles from poor kids!” Food companies won’t like those plans, either. But it’s worth a look. Not only did the number of SNAP recipients increase over the past eight years, so did Americans’ collective waistline. In 2009, eight states reported at least 30 percent of their adults were obese in 2015, 27 states did with even higher rates among minorities and the poor. The report also addresses how to improve food access, reduce “food deserts,” and promote healthier food. Democrats will use any proposed changes to portray Republicans as heartless  . But with food prices at an   low, rising obesity and diabetes rates, and no major overhaul in a generation, SNAP reform should be on the table.,", "prop": 0.16257147362006216},
{"article": " President Trump on Tuesday called for a government shutdown later this year and suggested the Senate might need to prohibit future filibusters, threatening to fracture Washington’s basic underpinnings to make progress on his legislative goals. His latest outbursts  —   no sitting president has called for the government to be shut down like this  —   could cast a shadow over how Congress approaches numerous bills this year. Trump wants Congress to overhaul the tax code, approve a $1 trillion infrastructure package and raise or suspend the debt ceiling before the government begins falling behind on its obligations. He has made little legislative progress in any of these areas, and he is on the verge of being dealt another stinging defeat as House Republicans splinter on a   bill for the second time in recent weeks. Trump’s new threats suggest he will jettison attempts at compromise and instead use the bombastic partisan warfare he employed during his campaign. The threats come after White House officials said they were furious at what they viewed as gloating by Democrats over the terms of a   spending bill that funds government operations through Sept. 30. In morning Twitter posts, Trump said he had to make concessions because Senate rules require 60 votes to pass legislation and Republicans control only 52 seats in the   chamber.  [Congress reaches deal to keep government open through September]        (Reuters)   He wrote that Republicans needed to pick up more seats in the 2018 midterm elections or consider changing filibuster rules so that the Senate’s minority party cannot block bills. “Our country needs a good ‘shutdown’ in September to fix mess!” he wrote. Trump could easily trigger a partial government shutdown in October, by directing Republicans not to negotiate with Democrats or by refusing to sign a spending bill that Congress sends him for approval. White House Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said Tuesday that Congress needs to return to the practice of passing   appropriations bills and sending them to the White House for approval, not continuing the recent practice of lurching from one stopgap spending bill to the next. “This is a   president, and he’s going to change Washington, D. C.,” Mulvaney said. “And if it takes a shutdown, that’s what it’s going to take. ” Mulvaney added, though, that a shutdown was not “desirable,” seeming to break with the president. Mulvaney plans to release a   budget in   that is supposed to help lawmakers craft their 2018 budgets. He said he wants work on those spending bills to begin immediately.  [Video: Mulvaney defines a ‘good’ shutdown]  Timothy Naftali, a presidential historian at New York University, said Trump’s threat of a shutdown was “totally, totally, totally” unprecedented. He said the threat, coupled with talk of changing filibuster rules, was typical of Trump’s approach. “Really what he’s talking about is destroying congressional procedures to get his way,” Naftali said. “When he’s losing, he likes to flip the game board. ” The White House did win numerous concessions during the recent negotiations with Congress over the stopgap spending bill. Democrats agreed, for example, to $1. 5 billion in new money for border security and roughly $21 billion in new defense spending, two of Trump’s top priorities. But, Mulvaney said, Democrats tried to “spike the football” because they blocked new funding for a wall along the Mexico border. Despite the White House’s frustration, Trump’s suggestion that spending bills should be able to pass with a simple majority was quickly dismissed by numerous top Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( . ). And Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer ( . Y.) said he was “deeply disappointed” in Trump’s calls for a shutdown. “It is truly a shame that the president is degrading it because he didn’t get 100 percent of what he wanted,” Schumer said. He went on to quote a Rolling Stones song to make his point, adding, “You can’t always get what you want. ” Trump’s attacks Tuesday illustrate how he continues to take a defiant stand with Congress more than 100 days after taking office. Top White House officials are hopeful that he can reach a deal with lawmakers to overhaul the tax code later this year, but budget rules will make that difficult without Democratic support. Democrats have so shown no willingness to accept the   tax cuts that Trump proposed last week, imperiling another of his campaign promises. Sensing how difficult it is to cobble together legislative support, Trump in recent weeks has openly floated numerous approaches to build a political coalition. He has said he wants to package his tax plan with his infrastructure plan, package his   plan with his infrastructure plan, pursue his   plan first, pursue his tax plan first, and pursue them separately but at the same time. The last government shutdown, in 2013 when Republicans controlled Congress, lasted more than two weeks. During that partial shutdown, the Obama administration said that at one point 850, 000 federal employees were placed on “furlough,” or leave without pay. Many other federal employees continued to work but were not paid until the shutdown ended. In total, the furloughs accounted for 6. 6 million days of lost work. The lost productivity cost the government $2 billion, the Obama White House said at the time. Diplomatic meetings were canceled, and U. S. officials largely stopped traveling to conferences and events across the country. The processing of tax returns slowed, and many agencies begin operating with much smaller staffs. Many government functions, such as law enforcement and national security, continued, but national parks closed and economists say there was a sizable impact on the economy, particularly in the Washington area. Once government shutdowns end, the federal employees are typically repaid for the time they were on furlough. Many lawmakers from both parties agree that the way the government funds its operations is broken and does not allow agencies to plan or prioritize. But the stopgap system has remained in place because lawmakers have a hard time agreeing on spending levels for different programs. Steve Bell, a Republican former staff director of the Senate Budget Committee, said Trump’s call to shut down the government over the problem was merited and could lead to a breakthrough. “I don’t know anything other than a really dramatic statement that could fix this,” he said. But Republican Judd Gregg, a former senator from New Hampshire, said Trump was finally coming to grips with the major differences between finding success in Washington compared with the business world. “I get the sense they are beginning to realize this isn’t like building a building or opening a golf course,” Gregg said of the White House. “This is high politics, not   buildings, and the process is entirely different. The motivation is entirely different. ” Former senator Kent Conrad, a Democrat from North Dakota and like Gregg an   of the Senate Budget Committee, said Trump’s call for a shutdown shows how he refuses to adjust to his role as president. “We really need a president to reach higher and to set a positive tone of responsible leadership,” Conrad said. “That’s what the country desperately needs. ”    ", "prop": 0.16287277086478394},
{"article": "LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation)   Nearly one in three migrant children tracked by a refugee charity have gone missing since the ”Jungle” camp in the northern French town of Calais was dismantled in October, the organization said on Wednesday. Refugee Youth Service said it could not locate a third of the 179 child migrants it had been tracking since authorities bulldozed the Jungle, home to up to 10, 000 people fleeing war or poverty in the Middle East and Africa. The fate of children staying in the squalid camp where migrants converged in the hope of making it across to Britain, has been a political problem for the British government. Religious leaders, refugee rights campaign groups and opposition parties have accused Britain of dragging its heels in helping to deal with unaccompanied children. Refugee Youth Service, which has worked in the Calais camp since November last year, said a lack of information and widespread misunderstanding about what will happen to them had led to many children disappearing. ”These are some of the most vulnerable children in the world, they have been let down time and time again,” said the charity’s   Ben Teuten said in a statement.  ”When they disappear we are extremely concerned that they will be preyed upon by traffickers and are unlikely to seek state support due to their treatment to date.” Earlier this month, the French authorities began moving about 1, 500 unaccompanied child migrants from the Jungle to reception camps across the country. Josie Naughton, who helped to set up another charity, Help Refugees, said many migrant children were frightened. ”Being placed somewhere that you don’t understand  —   where you don’t necessarily have access to translators or social workers  —   and not knowing how long you’ll be there, that triggers a natural instinct to take control of your own life,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Migrant children have two legal routes into Britain. One is under European Union rules that allow for children to be reunited with relatives already in the UK. The other is under the   Dubs amendment to the Immigration Act which allows the most   child refugees in Italy, Greece and France to be taken to the UK for sanctuary. Refugee Youth Service called on the French and British governments to provide clearer information to child migrants, and urged the authorities to report children as missing when they disappear from reception centers. A Home Office spokesperson told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by email that ”we have made significant progress in improving and speeding up the existing processes since the beginning of the year, but the primary responsibility for unaccompanied children in France lies with the French authorities”. French officials were not immediately available for comment.  (Reporting by Zoe Tabary @zoetabary, editing by Katie Nguyen.

{"article": "MOUNT VERNON, Va.  —   The costumed characters at George Washington’s gracious estate here are used to handling all manner of awkward queries, whether about   privies or the first president’s teeth. So when a visitor recently asked an     in a full skirt and head scarf if she knew Ona Judge, the woman didn’t miss a beat. Judge’s escape from the presidential residence in Philadelphia in 1796 had been “a great embarrassment to General and Lady Washington,” the woman said, before offering her own view of the matter. “Ona was born free, like everybody,” she said. “It was this world that made her a slave. ” It’s always 1799 at Mount Vernon, where more than a million visitors annually see the property as it was just before Washington’s death, when his will famously freed all 123 of his slaves. That liberation did not apply to Ona Judge, one of 153 slaves held by Martha Washington. But Judge, it turned out, evaded the Washingtons’ dogged (and sometimes illegal) efforts to recapture her, and would live quietly in New Hampshire for another 50 years. Now her story  —   and the challenge it offers to the notion that Washington somehow transcended the seamy reality of slaveholding  —   is having its fullest airing yet. Judge is among the 19 enslaved people highlighted in “Lives Bound Together: Slavery at George Washington’s Mount Vernon,” the first major exhibition here dedicated to the topic. She is also the subject of a book, “Never Caught: The Washingtons’ Relentless Pursuit of Their Runaway Slave, Ona Judge,” by Erica Armstrong Dunbar. Most scholars who have written about Judge’s escape have used it as a lens onto Washington’s evolving ideas about slavery. But “Never Caught,” published on Tuesday by 37 Ink, flips the perspective, focusing on what freedom meant to the people he kept in bondage. “We have the famous fugitives, like Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass,” Ms. Dunbar, a professor of black studies and history at the University of Delaware, said in an interview in Mount Vernon’s    food court. “But decades before them, Ona Judge did this. I want people to know her story. ” Research on slavery has exploded in the two decades since Mount Vernon, Monticello and other founder home sites introduced   tours and other prominent acknowledgments of the enslaved. “Lives Bound Together,” which runs through September 2018, was originally going to fill one    room in the museum here, but soon expanded to include six other galleries normally dedicated to the decorative and fine arts, books and manuscripts. “We had so much material, and it’s such an important story,” Susan P. Schoelwer, the curator at Mount Vernon, said. “We realized we could take many of the objects already on view and reframe them. ” The exhibition makes it clear just who poured from the elegant teapots and did the backbreaking work on the   estate. But integrating the harsh reality of slavery into the heroic story of Washington  —   “a leader of character,” as the title of the permanent exhibition across from the slavery show calls him  —   remains unfinished work, some scholars say. “He’s a much more mythic figure than Jefferson,” said Annette   the author of “The Hemingses of Monticello” and a Harvard professor. “Many people want to see him as perfect in some way. ” But his determined pursuit of Judge, she said, as much as his will freeing his slaves, reflects the basic   of slave owners. “It’s saying, ‘Whatever I might think about slavery in the abstract, I should be able to do what I want with my property,’” she said. Ms. Dunbar, the author of “Never Caught,” first came across Ona Judge in the late 1990s, when she was a graduate student at Columbia researching free black women in Philadelphia. One day in the archives, she noticed a 1796 newspaper ad offering $10 for the return of “a light Mulatto girl, much freckled, with very black eyes and bushy hair” who had “absconded” from the president’s house. “I said to myself: ‘Here I am, a scholar in this field. Why don’t I know about her? ’” Ms. Dunbar recalled. Since then, Judge’s story has inspired several children’s books, and even an episode of “Drunk History. ” But “Never Caught” is the first   nonfiction account, drawing on some newly unearthed sources to track her from Mount Vernon to New York City, Philadelphia and then New Hampshire, at a time when gradual abolition left the line between slavery and freedom ambiguous. “There’s a myth of the North as free, but her story shows how complicated that was,” Ms. Dunbar said. It is in the meticulous ledgers of Mount Vernon that we first see Ona Maria Judge, who was born around 1773 to an enslaved mother and a father who was a white indentured servant. At age 9 she was brought to live in the mansion house, eventually becoming Martha Washington’s personal maid. When Washington became president, Judge followed the first couple to New York and then Philadelphia, home to a growing free black community. Free blacks, Ms. Dunbar writes, aided Judge’s escape in the midst of a presidential dinner, after she had learned that she was to be given to Martha Washington’s granddaughter, Eliza. And it was free blacks who helped her catch a sailing ship to Portsmouth, N. H. where she married, had three children and lived on the edge of poverty, laboring in households far less exalted than the Washingtons’. In two interviews published in abolitionist newspapers shortly before her death in 1848, Judge testified to the desire for freedom that drove her to run away from the Washington household, where she had “never received the least moral or mental instruction,” she said. Judge’s story, Ms. Dunbar said, explodes any notion of “privileged” house slaves, or of the benevolence of the Washingtons, whose far from passive role in perpetuating slavery  —   and in doling out sometimes brutal punishment to the rebellious  —   is described in detail. Ms. Dunbar describes how the Washingtons quietly maneuvered around Pennsylvania’s 1780 gradual abolition law, rotating their slaves in and out of the state every six months. And she recounts their shock at the “ingratitude” of Judge, who fled “without any provocation,” the president wrote. After hearing that Judge was in Portsmouth, Washington, offering a story that she had been “enticed away by a Frenchman,” discreetly sent a federal customs officer to bring her back, circumventing procedures laid out in the 1793 fugitive slave law he himself had signed. When Judge agreed to return on condition that she be freed on Martha’s death, George Washington dismissed her demand as “totally inadmissible. ” However much he might favor general emancipation, he wrote to the customs officer, granting Judge any say in her fate would only “reward unfaithfulness” and give ideas to others “far more deserving of favor. ” In August 1799, Washington, through another associate, tried again to capture her, but was foiled when Judge received a tip about the plot and disappeared. Four months later Washington was dead, freeing all his slaves in his will. Judge and the others held by Martha Washington remained her legal property. Ms. Dunbar calls Washington’s act “no small thing,” but does not see the former president, who had no biological children to disinherit, as the hero of the story. “When it was safe, he emancipated his slaves,” she said. “He dealt with it after his death. And you know what? That’s what all the founders did with slavery: They kicked the can down the road. ”", "prop": 0.5136566002464644},
{"article": "Trump ally Chris Ruddy has caused quite a stir over the past 24 hours. The CEO of the   website Newsmax, a close friend of Trump’s, has been making the media rounds saying President Trump is considering firing special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Department of Justice investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. ”I think he’s considering perhaps terminating the special counsel,” Ruddy told PBS NewsHour Monday night, though he went on to say he thinks, personally, it would be a bad idea. ”I think he’s weighing that option. I think it’s pretty clear by what one of his lawyers said on television recently. I personally think it would be a very significant mistake.” Why not, right? It’s believable enough. After all, Trump fired James Comey as FBI director. Trump reportedly told top Russian diplomats in the Oval Office that pressure is now taken off after firing Comey. And here’s that lawyer interview Ruddy was referring to: But firing Mueller would be a political bomb in Washington. Mueller, the former FBI director, is widely respected on both sides of the aisle, something that’s pretty tough to do in Washington nowadays. Both Democrats and Republicans pushed back. House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Adam Schiff,  . said the move would have the unintended consequence of keeping Mueller in charge: Sen. Lindsey Graham,  . C. said the move would be a ”disaster” and, he added, ”There’s no reason to fire Mueller. What’s he done to be fired?” Sen. Susan Collins,   said it would be ”extraordinarily unwise.” House Speaker Paul Ryan,  . said Tuesday he had confidence in Mueller and that he should be left alone to conduct an independent investigation, NPR’s Susan Davis reports. ”These investigations are important,” Ryan said. ”They need to be independent. The need to be thorough. They need to go where the facts go. But we also have a duty to serve the people that elected us to fix the problems that they are confronting in their daily lives and that’s what we’re doing.” House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy,  . accused the media of ”creating a rumor that’s not happening.” The White House forcefully disputed Ruddy’s claims, saying he speaks for himself, not the president. ”Mr. Ruddy never spoke to the president regarding this issue,” White House press secretary Sean Spicer said. ”With respect to this subject, only the president or his attorneys are authorized to comment.” Of course, neither of those statements is a denial that Trump is considering it. The move would be Nixonian. Trump himself does not have the authority to directly fire the special counsel. That would have to be done by the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, given that Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from DOJ’s Russia investigation. Both Rosenstein and Sessions are testifying Tuesday on Capitol Hill. Rosenstein was asked about it and answered this way, ”You have my assurance that Director Muller will have the full degree of independence that he needs to conduct the investigation.” He added, ”I’m not going to follow any order unless I believe those are lawful and appropriate orders. Under the regulation, Special Counsel Mueller may be fired only for good cause, and I am required to put that cause in writing. That’s what I would do. If there were good cause, I would consider it. If there were not good cause, it wouldn’t matter to me what anybody says.” But both Rosenstein and Sessions serve at the pleasure of the president, and if Rosenstein refused to fire Mueller, in theory, Trump could appoint someone to Rosenstein’s job who would do his bidding, just as Nixon did after the infamous ”Saturday Night Massacre,” where Robert Bork (yes, that Robert Bork) carried out Nixon’s wishes. Ruddy issued a terse response directed at Spicer, but also admitted he didn’t speak to Trump personally about this. ”Spicer issued a bizarre late night press release that a) doesn’t deny my claim the President is considering firing Mueller and b) says I didn’t speak to the President about the matter  —   when I never claimed to have done so,” Ruddy told Politico Playbook and others in an email. ”Memo to Sean: focus your efforts on exposing the   Russian allegations against POTUS and highlighting his remarkable achievements! Don’t waste time trying to undermine one of your few allies.” The president himself got in on the act this morning, tweeting about ”fake news” and ”phony sources”: But Ruddy continued to double, triple and quadruple down Tuesday morning. On CSPAN: ”I have some good sources in the administration. I think it’s an accurate statement.” On CNN to anchor Chris Cuomo: ”I think it is a consideration the president has had, because Mueller is illegitimate as special counsel. Chris, remember there is no evidence of wrongdoing there’s no evidence of collusion there’s no evidence of obstruction. . .. The basis of his investigation is  .” CNN also reported, per an administration source, ”No one is recommending that,” but it ”hasn’t been ruled out.” 1. There has been a   effort to delegitimize Mueller. See, for example, Newt Gingrich’s changed tone. From a conservative radio talk show: ”I think Congress should now intervene and they should abolish the independent counsel, because Comey makes so clear that it’s the poison fruit of a deliberate manipulation by the FBI director leaking to the New York Times, deliberately set up this particular situation. It’s very sick.” On Twitter Monday, Gingrich said, ”Republicans are delusional if they think” Mueller ”is going to be fair” (Gingrich appears to be referring to donations to Democrats by some members of Mueller’s team, as reported on by CNN): Less than a month ago, he called Mueller a ”superb choice,” someone whose ”reputation is impeccable for honesty and integrity.” And he’s not the only one: 2. Let’s not overthink this: Trump, his allies and his White House also just like to mess with the media and stir confusion among the public. They don’t mind stirring the pot to distract, deliberately provoke and disrupt. They have done it before: Think about how it floated the idea of Mueller’s potential conflicts of interest and remember those charges of Democratic ties to acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe? It’s all an effort to manufacture news cycles, create conflicts, distract from other pressing issues and raise questions about someone for a couple days. When it dies down, in the end, they hope they’ve succeeded in muddying up opponents.", "prop": 0.8142027721875895},

I think they may be the best ribs I’ve ever had  —   including in Texas, the Carolinas, Memphis, and New York. The Czech lands, at least some of them, are known for pork. Not very long ago, I saw and wrote about a play by Vaclav Havel: The Pig, all about a pig roast. Funny to think of, isn’t it? Out for a walk in Budapest, I come to an intersection. I have to press a button, to put the lights in my favor. To make the traffic stop. The word on the device is “VARJON. ” Huh. Several times, I have reviewed a Hungarian pianist, Denes Varjon. Turns out the name means “Wait. Hold on. Cool your jets!” I can tell you that it’s  . Properly written, it’s “Eötvös. ” One more musical note? From fairly far away, I spot a bust of Liszt. Handsome devil. Helluva swordsman in his younger days. He grew religious, or at least mystical. Don’t know about then   …     Budapest has a lovely monument to Shakespeare, showing the playwright bowing. It is we who must bow to him, of course. Funny to have referred to him as a playwright. He tried his hand at poetry, too. This is pretty good: a shop called, simply, the “Biggest Souvenir Shop. ” A sign also advises that you can use the toilet. Must be good for business. Everyone searches out a toilet. Then you may well buy an item or two: out of convenience, or gratitude (for the use of the facilities)  —   or maybe even out of a sense of obligation. I wish I had a business mind. If you do, I salute you. Behold the Gresham Palace. It is a stunning building, an example of Art Nouveau. It is now a Four Seasons hotel. Imagine holing up there for a weekend, or a week, or a month. I’ll have to leave it at imagining   …     Walking outside Parliament, I can’t help thinking of Janos Horvath. He is one of the grand men of Hungarian politics. I interviewed him a few years ago. He was a political prisoner of the Nazis, and then of the Communists. Dodged death more than once. After the war, he was the youngest member of Parliament. Then came a long, productive American exile. (Ran for Congress, as a Republican!) After the fall of Communism, he returned to Hungary, where he reentered Parliament as the oldest member. How thrilling it must have been  —   how satisfying  —   to reenter that body, after all that time. It must have been a dream come true, really. Not so much his personal return to Parliament, but the death of Communism and the reintroduction of democracy. As we are sailing along, I have to tell you: The Danube is more green than blue. The waltz is “On the Beautiful Blue Danube. ” I’m sure it got that name for a reason. The reason, I don’t quite see, with my own eyes   …     There is an eatery in Bratislava: the Ankara Kebab Shop. Bet it’s good. There are Ankara Kebab Shops all over the world. They tend to be good. And I have a related item: In Vienna, I go into the Mozart Café, hard by the Sacher Hotel. (Within it? I’m not sure.) What do you get, if you’re in the mood for something sweet? A slice of Sacher cake, of course. It would be strange not to. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the worst piece of Sacher cake I have ever had in my life. (And I’ve had dozens.) (Okay, hundreds.) Drier than the Sahara. Without the schlag, it is barely edible, and it’s barely edible then. I report this to a friend of mine (Bill Kristol). He says, “Decline of the West. ” I say, “Yes: but I bet the falafels, all over, are wonderful. ” Incidentally, the best slice of Sacher cake I have ever had was in Anif, outside Salzburg  —   at the Friesacher Hotel. I’ve had many slices at the Sacher Hotel (in Salzburg). Hit or miss. May be the same way at the Friesacher, not sure. My sample there is too small   …     In Vienna, as in Salzburg and elsewhere in Austria, pedestrians wait at the red lights. Even if there are no cars within miles. They wait and wait until that sucker turns green. My American feet can hardly stand it. But if you bolt, while others are waiting, it feels awkward. This goes triple when there are children with their parents. You know? It is a shock, for someone like me, who lives in New York, to see female cabbies. Attractive, young female cabbies. I think, “This is a sign of a civilized place. ” Would you want your daughter to be a cabbie in a big city? I have a feeling that Viennese fathers don’t mind. (That Vienna has not always been a civilized place, I don’t need to state. Do I?) St. Stephen’s Cathedral is very, very old. But there’s a touch of the modern here now. Three words are beamed up toward the ceiling, from a projector of some kind: Glaube, Hoffnung, and Liebe, which is to say, “faith,” “hope,” and “charity. ” This mingling  —   of the medieval and the modern  —   is nicely brought off, I must say (conservative that I am). I peek into another church  —   very, very ornate. Sort of the church version of    Trump’s club in Palm Beach. (I had a very nice evening there once. I liked the club, even if it was “over the top. ” There’s room in life for   . Not everything can be under.) A sign says that a choir from Baylor University will sing here in the church. They’ll sing Bach and Pärt (i. e. Arvo Pärt, the contemporary Estonian)  —   and the Alleluia of Randall Thompson, one of the great hits of the American choral repertoire. Glad about that. Cruising along the Danube is a ship called “Jane Austen. ” Funny to think of the writer honored in a ship’s name! But why not? The greatest compliment ever paid an author, I think, was paid to Jane Austen  —   by I forget which Oxbridge don. Someone said to him, “You don’t read novels, do you?” He said, “I certainly do: I read all six of them every year. ” (I’ve never gotten through one, but we can discuss that another time.) You don’t want to get in the way of someone’s picture. You want to wait till he snaps. For years  —   eons  —   you could pass behind the  . But what do you do now? It can be impossible to know whether the guy’s taking a selfie or not. You don’t know which way the camera, or “camera,” is pointing. Do you know what I mean? Aboard our ship are conservative luminaries: Mona Charen, David   Charles Murray, John O’Sullivan, others. Those others include General Ervin Rokke, of the Air Force. He is an hombre and a half. Tall, authoritative, gentlemanly. His name is pronounced “Rocky. ” The general is from Minnesota and a   Norwegian. He went to the Air Force Academy. And then Harvard, for two degrees  —   master’s and Ph. D. His dissertation adviser was Kissinger. In the military, Rokke played many, many roles. Later, he was a college president. Now he does other things. We talk about multiculturalism, and the importance (as we see it) of E pluribus unum, one America. He mentions the time he began to study Norwegian. His aunt was alarmed. She said to his father, “Our family has been trying to get rid of a Norwegian accent for 50 years. And now this?” I love the study of languages  —   but I also love the assimilationist spirit. Speaking of language: General Rokke tells a story about a pilot, on a flight. The pilot in question “greased the landing. ”   people like me tend to like military lingo.

I figure I should get some Linzer torte, but it doesn’t happen. Could it be for the best, given my experience with the Sacher variety in Vienna? I do see people eating ice cream  —   quite older people, who are licking their cones with relish. I like this sight. And I’m reminded of something. Years ago, in an   parlor in Washington, D. C.  —   Thomas Sweet (Georgetown)  —   I looked over and there was Bob Hope. He was licking a cone, and enjoying it very much. He was very, very old. His skin was translucent.

It is the “City of Three Rivers. ” “I thought that was Pittsburgh,” I remark to a local. He says, “We were here first!” Lots of Germans in Pittsburgh, too, by the way. As for Passau, I suppose I’ve seen a more beautiful city  —   I just can’t remember it. Passau is pretty much unsurpassed, in my experience. I see a sign for Rohrbach  —   which lets me know where Dana Rohrbacher’s ancestors came from, at least some of them. (Rohrbacher was a Reagan speechwriter and is a California congressman.) Above, I wrote “Passau, Germany. ” Bear with me for a second. To senior citizens, a city, followed by a comma, followed by “Germany,” is normal. It is normal to young or youngish people, too. When I was growing up, there was no “Germany. ” I would occasionally read old literature and see “Magdeburg, Germany,” for example. Or “Aachen, Germany. ” That looked antique  —   truly out of another era. Because Germany had been divided into West and East forever, or so I thought. It was all I knew. Then, after 1990, towns were called, for example, “Magdeburg, Germany. ” I can’t tell you how weird that looked to me. Which must seem very weird now. But not to those in my age bracket, probably. On my way home, I meet a young Dutchman. He lived in America for six months, training as a pilot. (Hope he greases landings.) He was in Phoenix. Loves America. “What do you like about it?” I ask. The food, for one thing. “Do you like hamburgers?” I ask. “I like Five Guys,” he says. “But I also love Bombay Express. And the Cheesecake Factory. There’s nothing like American cheesecake. It’s not nearly as good in the Netherlands, because of our health regulations. We can’t make food as rich. In America, there are no such regulations. So you can make cheesecake good and full and right. ” I’ll be damned. Never thought of that. But don’t give our regulators any ideas. The last thing they need is encouragement. There’s something else this young Dutch pilot likes about America: Ross Dress for Less. I’ve never heard of it. But I’ve never heard of a lot of things. And the name is damn catchy.

{"article": "As we close in on the June 12 Tony Awards  —   the excitement mounts!  —   here’s a snapshot of the race: “Hamilton” has a   16 nominations, but it’s not going to topple Mel Brooks’ “The Producers” for the most wins. Mel will remain the King of Broadway with his 12 Tonys. An informal survey of Tony voters reveals a few cracks in the “Hamilton” facade. Cynthia Erivo, the breakout star of “The Color Purple,” is the clear favorite for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Musical, snapping the prize away from Phillipa Soo, of “Hamilton. ” Both are terrific, but   Erivo is one reason why “The Color Purple,” a show dismissed by many voters back in 2005, is on track to win Best Revival of a Musical. Soo was also one of the “Hamilton” cast members who agitated for a share of the profits. There are plenty to go around, of course, but more than a few producers  —   and some writers from the Dramatists Guild  —   are worried about setting a precedent. They’re prepared to fight Actors’ Equity on this front if it comes up in future negotiations. “We will argue that ‘Hamilton’ is unique,” one producer says. “Actors are not entitled to profits. They’re entitled to a paycheck, but we take the risk. ” Leslie Odom Jr. my “Smash”   was another “Hamilton” agitator, so there’s grumbling about him as well. He’s terrific as Aaron Burr, for which he’s nominated for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Musical, and I think he’s on track to be a big movie or TV star. But more than a few voters told me they marked their ballot for Danny Burstein of “Fiddler on the Roof” instead. “He’s earned it,” one producer says. My money’s still on Odom, but if there’s going to be an upset on Tony night, look for it in this category. The Tony for Best Choreography will likely go to Savion Glover for “Shuffle Along. ” Voters like this show, and Glover’s work is one reason why it moves so swiftly. He’s brilliantly   the original musical’s dances while giving them a modern spin. There’s support for “Shuffle” director George C. Wolfe in his category, but probably not enough to upset Thomas Kail, who staged “Hamilton. ” Let me put in a word for John Doyle. I never gave much thought to “The Color Purple,” but his production has made me a huge fan of the show. In fact, I’m waving my hand in the air and singing “Like a blade of   a   a waterfall” as I write this. David Rockwell is quietly gaining traction for Best Scenic Design of a Musical for his exquisite jewel box set for “She Loves Me. ” Voters adore this revival, lovingly directed by Scott Ellis. It won’t topple “The Color Purple,” but voters will give it a nod by recognizing Rockwell. I’m picking up a lot of support in her category for Ann Roth, who designed the witty costumes for “Shuffle Along. ” Everybody loves this salty old broad. (She won’t be offended by that phrase, trust me!) How can you not vote for a woman who breaks out the charcuterie and the vino when you visit her at her costume shop? Plus, she should have won for her brilliantly funny costumes for “The Book of Mormon” in 2011. (“Priscilla, Queen of the Desert” won, if you can believe that.) Now that I’ve thoroughly depressed the “Hamilton” producers with what they won’t win, let me lift their spirits with what they will win. Best Musical is a given, and so is Best Original Score (Music   Lyrics) Written for the Theatre. It pains me to admit this, but I’m coming around to   Miranda’s score, which I’ve given a few spins on my CD player. I’m not a rapper, and my head hurts from all that rhyming (“Aaron Burr, Sir”?) but “Burn” and “It’s Quiet Uptown” are lovely. And “Wait for It” is a Broadway standard in the making. “Hamilton” is also going to win Best Book of a Musical, but I must report that voters find the   “Hamilton: The Revolution” a bit much. That’s the book Manuel   with his Boswell, Jeremy McCarter, about the making of the musical. “I’ve never read such pretentious drivel in my life,” scoffs one voter. “The  !” Still, he’s casting his vote for the “Hamilton” script. Like many, he’s trying to separate the show from the hype, which everyone agrees is out of control. As another voter says: “I love ‘Hamilton.’ But if I have to read one more story about it in the New York Times, I’m canceling my subscription. ” As they say in “The Color Purple”: “Amen!”", "prop": 0.9678889005617718},
{"article": "Nearly everything you have been told about the food you eat and the exercise you do and their effects on your health should be met with a raised eyebrow. Dozens of studies are publicized every week. But those studies hardly slake people’s thirst for answers to questions about how to eat or how much to exercise. Does exercise help you maintain your memory? What kind? Walking? Intense exercise? Does eating carbohydrates make you fat? Can you prevent breast cancer by exercising when you are young? Do vegetables protect you from heart disease? The problem is one of signal to noise. You can’t discern the signal  —   a lower risk of dementia, or a longer life, or less obesity, or less cancer  —   because the noise, the enormous uncertainty in the measurement of such things as how much you exercise or what exactly you eat, is overwhelming. The signal is often weak, meaning if there is an effect of lifestyle it is minuscule, nothing like the link between smoking and lung cancer, for example. And there is no gold standard of measurement, nothing that everyone agrees on and uses to measure aspects of lifestyle. The result is a large body of studies whose conclusions are not reproducible. “We don’t know how to measure diet or exercise,” said Dr. Barnett Kramer, director of the National Cancer Institute’s division of disease prevention. His division is working on ways to sort out inconsistencies in research used to generate health advice, hoping to improve what has become a real mess: “You can ask people how many times a week or how many times a month they eat bread or berries or ask them to keep a diary of what they ate in the last 24 hours. ” But, he said, it should be no surprise that people misremember or give researchers an answer they think makes them sound good. “I can’t remember what meals I ate a week ago,” Dr. Kramer said. “Now ask me what meals I had as an adolescent, or how much I exercised. ” David Allison, director of the nutrition obesity research center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, says the same problems plague obesity research, with only two things known with certainty. All other things being equal, if you eat more calories, you will gain weight. And all other things being equal, if you exercise enough, you will lose a small amount of weight. Adding to the confusion is a cacophony of poorly designed research, the tendency for different researchers studying the same effect to use different measurements and report outcomes differently, and researchers’ tendency to selectively report positive or “interesting” results. The result is what Dr. Kramer calls whipsaw literature. “One week drinking coffee is good for you, and the next week it is lethal,” he says. The situation is so bad that what gets published tends to be what the scientists believe ahead of time, says Dr. John Ioannidis, a professor of medicine and of health research and policy at Stanford University’s medical school. “There are so many nutrients and so many diets,” he said. “So many outcomes  —   heart disease, cancer, stroke. What kind of data do you collect? A   at two months, six months, two years, 10 years? You end up having millions of choices. ” And the scientists get to pick the one they want. “I can get you any result you want in any observational data set,” he said. There have been rigorous lifestyle studies, but they are few and far between. A large diet study in Spain found that a Mediterranean diet, with fruits, vegetables, fish and olive oil or nuts, decreased the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Two large federal studies looked at a   diet but failed to find evidence it protects against colon cancer. Then there are the seemingly contradictory but   studies. One large federal study found that  —   contrary to all assumptions  —   diet and weight loss did not prevent heart attacks and strokes in people with Type 2 diabetes. Another large federal study found that people at risk for Type 2 diabetes could stave it off by losing a modest amount of weight and exercising. A few years ago, two researchers decided to ask just how crazy the cancer and diet literature was. They began with a cookbook, “The Boston   Cookbook,” and randomly selected recipes, listing the ingredients, until they had 50 distinct ingredients. Then they did a literature search asking if those ingredients were associated with cancer. Four out of five were linked to cancer, the researchers reported, either increasing or decreasing the risk. Often the same ingredient that increased risk in one study decreased it in another. Those ingredients not associated with cancer risk tended to be odd, like terrapin, and had not been studied by nutrition researchers. But when the authors, Dr. Jonathan Schoenfeld, a radiation oncologist at the   Cancer Institute, and Dr. Ioannidis, looked at   of the ingredients, which combined data from all the studies, the effects generally went away. They titled their paper, “Is everything we eat associated with cancer?” That study is no surprise to a group that puts together an authoritative guide, the Physicians Data Query, for the National Cancer Institute. The group’s screening and prevention board wants to make some sort of statement about whether diet affects cancer risk. But the studies are just so unreliable that it is hard to draw conclusions. The board’s feelings about whether diet has any link to cancer “are pretty consistently negative,” said Dr. Donald Berry, a biostatistician at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who is a member of the board. “Were I to write a paper on the subject, I might use this variant of their title: ‘Is anything we eat associated with cancer? ’” Dr. Berry said. “And my answer would be ‘No. The preponderance of the evidence is either negative or unreliable and subject to   conclusions. ’” Some medical experts say the problems with lifestyle studies are so overwhelming  —   and the chance of finding anything reproducible and meaningful so small  —   that it might be best to just give up on those questions altogether. “They may not be worth studying,” said Dr. Vinay Prasad, a cancer researcher at Oregon Health and Science University. “People want certainty, but, boy, we have no good answers. ” As for Dr. Kramer, he has not given up on rigorous research. What is needed at this point, he says, is a little more humility among researchers in interpreting and reporting the implications of their own evidence.", "prop": 0.3614818772751942},
{"article": "There are two great capitals of liberal internationalism in Europe. One is the Hague, where sits the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court. The International Criminal Court, established by the Rome Statute over the objections of the United States, is the philosophical heir to the ad hoc tribunals at Nuremberg that saw to the necessary business of hanging Nazis such as Werner Braune and Otto Ohlendorf after World War II. Besides the International Criminal Court, which is tasked with prosecuting crimes against humanity, war crimes, and crimes of genocide, the Hague is home to an older and related institution, which labors under the unwieldy name of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991. Karadzic, with his famous silvery mop, is the face of a conflict about which Americans were conflicted, it being one of those terribly complicated post —  Cold War episodes involving a country that isn’t there any more. After the war, the nationalist crank changed his name and became a practitioner of the homeopathic healing arts, even publishing a few articles on the subject. Which is to say, he attempted to follow in reverse the career of Michael Weiner, the Berkeley quack (author of Herbs That Heal: A Prescription for Herbal Healing) who you know today as   ranter Michael Savage. The memory of Karadzic and his crimes faded quickly. Americans of a certain age will vaguely remember the siege of Sarajevo, domestic political questions about whether Newt Gingrich and congressional Republicans would use American involvement in Bosnia against President Bill Clinton, and perhaps some subsequent grumblings on some parts of the Right that we might have been fighting on the wrong side, given that the campaign against Slobodan Milosevic, Radovan Karadzic, and their allies put the United States effectively into alliance with radical Islamists, some of them connected to Osama bin Laden. Pat Buchanan, who was one of the leading voices against American involvement in Bosnia, would later draw parallels to U. S. pressure on Putin to make peace with the Chechens under the headline “Bin Laden’s Useful Idiots. ” Putin’s apologists, like Karadzic’s, believe that the strongmen of Eastern Europe are the Christian West’s first line of defense against the Islamic hordes, and thus are to be indulged. It is easy to imagine Donald Trump, whose admiration for Putin is plain, following that line of argument. In the Hague, we have a court dedicated to the belief that there exists a law of war, that there is such a thing as a war crime, and certain eternal rules of decency and humanness apply in every situation, even in the madness of war. In Brussels, we have the bloody and horrifying evidence that the Islamic world harbors a great many who reject those notions, who know no law but the savagery they call a religion, who revel in their indecency, who believe that the battlefield is everywhere and that all who fail to submit are the equivalent of soldiers at arms, to be dealt with by any means necessary. In the Hague, they are in the business of drawing lines: This is war, and beyond this is atrocity. For the jihadists, those lines are not boundaries, but starting lines. There is no equivalent to the Hague in the Islamic world, and that is not mere coincidence.

{"article": ", I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. Sometimes it seems the Internet is, at its core, a tremendous nostalgia machine. You are, at any given moment, just a few clicks and keystrokes away from local television that aired 40 years ago, from discontinued toys, and from sounds you haven’t heard in forever (or at all). It seems fitting, if not outright magical, for example, that the immersive virtual worlds of my youth —  computer games like Lemonade Stand (1979) The Oregon Trail (1979)  Choplifter (1982) Carmen Sandiego (1985) and Think Quick! (1987) —  are all playable online. Back when I was playing these games on my family’s Apple IIc, they were often   by a generation that had first encountered home computers as adults —  and distrusted gaming as a waste of time. If anything destroys the practice of reading once and for all, The New York Times warned in 1994, it will be computer games. Computer games did not destroy reading. Instead, games had a profound effect on the popular perception of computers. The ginormous machines of the 1960s and 1970s were viewed as either complex and boring or, in science fiction, threatening. “I think the fact that computers were primarily used to play games really helped to get people to accept that computers were good and helpful devices instead of the negative portrayals of them in the ‘60s and ‘70s in movies,” said John Romero, the   of id Software and the designer of several hugely popular games including Wolfenstein 3D (1992) Doom (1993) and Quake (1996). Games also shaped people’s understanding of what computers are for —  and what humankind’s relationship with such machines could be like. Computers were serious tools, yes, but they could enable exploration and experimentation, too. Computers weren’t just expensive calculators or advanced typewriters they were fun. “I strongly believe that games have been largely underrated in the spread of what we might think of as our ‘orientation’ toward computing,” said Laine Nooney, a cultural historian of video games and computing. “In the span of less that 20 years, many Americans went from having never seen a computer to interacting with these machines in many facets of their daily lives. Gaming is the first form of computational technology most of us ever handled   …     Games taught us principles of interaction and screen responsiveness, about coordination between hand and eye, how to type, how to sit, how to look at a screen. ” Early games also served a crucial function in the shaping the broader culture of computing —  including promoting central ideas about openness and sharing that would eventually become foundational values of the web. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, game makers —  like anyone who found themselves tinkering with computers at the time —  were inclined to share what they learned, and to build on one another’s designs.  This dynamic was, Nooney says, an “outgrowth of the general need for a decently sized but geographically disparate group of microcomputer users to trade knowledge. ”   The thriving culture of early computing magazines was a direct byproduct of this need —  people helped debug each other’s code, swapped tips about hardware, and generally supported one another. “It wasn’t uncommon for for someone who had written in with a question and included their address to receive a phone call from another computer user helping them with their question —  since all another reader had to do was get the operator on the phone and request a lookup by name and town,” Nooney said. “The Apple II is really a product of the hacker culture which originally came from universities —  they were the only organizations able to afford mainframes and later minicomputers but still allow freedom to play and experiment,” said Bill Budge, the legendary game designer who created Raster Blaster (1981) and other early games. “Certainly, the Apple II exposed more people to computers than was possible at universities. When I started at Google, I was surprised by how many engineers had played my games as kids and been inspired to pursue tech at a very early age. So the Apple II was definitely an accelerator of hacker culture. ” That same culture, and the premium it placed on openness, would eventually carry over to the early web: a platform that anyone could build on, that no one person or company could own. That idea is at the heart of what proponents for net neutrality are trying to protect —  that is, the belief that openness is a central value, perhaps even the foundational value, of what is arguably the most important technology of our time. But there isn’t a straight line from early computing culture to early web culture —  even though many of the same players were involved in early game development and early online communities. In fact, in the   at a time when many Americans were buying personal computers for the first time, the open culture that once permeated gaming (and computing in general) changed dramatically. “Nintendo arrives on the scene just about the time the Macintosh does, and it has a similar effect on computing by advancing the idea that closed systems —  designed systems that users don’t fool around with —  are the way to go,” said Henry Lowood, a historian of technology at Stanford University Libraries. It wasn’t just Nintendo or Apple. The open culture at Atari had already begun to shift, for instance, when it was acquired by Warner Communications in the late 1970s. At the time, Warren Robinett, who designed Adventure for Atari’s 2600 —  the first graphical video game of its kind —  was told not to work on the game by supervisors who didn’t think the concept would be possible, given the memory constraints of computing systems of the era. “I worked on it in secret,” Robinett told me. “I produced what you could call a feasibility demonstration, and I showed it to some of the other people at Atari. If [my boss] had been a more powerful person, he would have just crushed me. Adventure could have easily not happened if things had been slightly different. ” Adventure’s enormous impact on the future of gaming —  and, arguably, on the broader visual aesthetic of that would come to dominate the web —  is difficult to quantify. “I realize that to somebody who grew up after adventure games became commonplace, that it seems like Adventure was probably handed down from a mountain on a stone tablet, but it wasn’t,” Robinett said. “I was lucky that I was in the right place at the right time, and got to make one of those little innovations that had an impact and changed the way we do things. ” But technological progress has a way of seeming inevitable in retrospect. From the player’s perspective, the culture that defined the early web seemed similarly preordained —  like a natural extension of the dynamics that shaped virtual spaces in offline gaming. I grew up playing Think Quick, for example, a game released in 1987 by The Learning Company, which Robinett   after his time at Atari. The game involved exploring the rooms of a castle opening trap doors, finding secret objects, evading the dreaded slime worms, and eventually ousting a dragon. It also offered a mode called Castle Creator —  think of it as a kind of predecessor for creative mode in Minecraft —  that let players create their own levels. You could do everything from building the layout of the rooms to designing icons for hidden objects. Years later, when Romero created Doom, he took the idea of game modification a step further. Players could build their own levels, and in some cases entirely new games, using the game files that Doom made accessible to players. “Just the way there had been this interesting coincidence with Apple and Nintendo [introducing] these closed systems in 1984, there was another interesting coincidence that happens about 10 years later, and that coincidence is the launch of Doom and the web,” Lowood, the Stanford historian, told me. “Because Doom, the way it was architected, could be modified —  that has been looked at by people in the technology community as the beginning of open source. This sort of open culture reemerged. It’s a key thing —  open versus closed, sharing versus   —  and these tensions are really important parts of the history of computing. ” The cultural standing of video games, meanwhile, has only grown in the mobile Internet age. Even during the economic recession, the video game sector in the United States grew 9. 6 percent and added $6. 2 billion to the economy —  outpacing the entire national economy four times over, according to CNET. “I don’t think its too much of an exaggeration to say games are everywhere,” Lowood said. “There are   systems built into a lot of parts of our lives. Games have to be seen not just as the specific   but also a part of the story of the impact of technology on our lives, a part of the story of different ways of learning, different ways of doing business. All of these changes that have occurred as a result of technology, games are a big part of those stories. ”             Like this?

{"article": "I seem to have been writing articles about conservatism all my life. Not quite, but almost. The first such article for which I was paid appeared in print in 1969 in the Swinton Journal (which, not at all coincidentally, was the first magazine I ever edited.) The article had the uninviting title “The Direction of Conservatism,” and in it I advocated educational vouchers, road pricing, flexible exchange rates, and many other good things from the handbook of classical liberalism. It had quite an impact too. When a second article on flexible exchange rates appeared (“Set the Pound Free”  —   I had a gift for headlines) Edward Heath, then Tory leader, forbade all the MPs in the parliamentary party from even discussing the topic in the future. Poor Ted. After that it was almost inevitable that as prime minister he would himself introduce floating rates, as he did in an early   crisis. From the Swinton Journal I jumped onto the Daily Telegraph as a parliamentary   producing four comic weekday columns on the previous day’s proceedings in the House of Commons, from 1972 to 1979. In that capacity and later ones, I lived through the Heath revolution (followed swiftly by the Heath  ) the (Enoch) Powellite revolution (aborted) the Thatcherite revolution (blocked and delayed by “the Wets” in numerous petty rebellions) the eventual establishment of the Thatcher Terror, its overthrow after a decade by notables from the   leadership class, then the slow, grey disintegration of the party during the John Major interregnum, the long years of exile under the   usurpation, and, finally, Restoration! under the triumphant Tory banner of Modernization. And all that was before I arrived in America and National Review to encounter Buckleyites, Birchers, neos, paleos,   RINOs, and now Monty Trump’s Flying Circus. RELATED: How Should Conservatives Respond to the Age of Trump? It is possible, as some predict, that its present civil war over the Brexit referendum will finally break the Tory party’s tensile unity. The history of Toryism is full of party splits, realignments, breakaways, and mergers. If the Tories split on this occasion, they will likely pause, regroup, and reunify (perhaps joining with UKIP) as they have done in the past, and as the Canadian Conservatives did under the redoubtable Stephen Harper. Great political parties and great movements of ideas sometimes die, but they rarely fade away. They are tough old beasts that fight from the stomach as much as from the head. And they certainly never die of anything as ephemeral as shame. RELATED: No, Conservatism Isn’t Dying Out, But what will they survive as? Both Trump admirers (broadly defined) and Trump detractors (ditto) see Republican and conservative establishments reeling before a hostile takeover by an invasion of populist Vikings and Visigoths who have come from nowhere under the banners of “No Entitlement Reform” and “America First” nationalism. Peggy Noonan celebrates this Jonah Goldberg will resist it just short of in perpetuity. But the main truth here is that this invasion doesn’t come from outside. It is an invasion mainly of people who have been in the ranks of conservatism all along. It is understandable if most commentators haven’t fully grasped this, because the invasion is led by Donald Trump, who does come from outside both movement and party and who, as Camille Paglia noted in a very different context, makes a very fetching Viking (“bedecked with the phallic tongue of a violet Celtic floral tie . . . looking like a triumphant dragon on the thrusting prow of a long boat”  —   wow! ). But the more we look at who votes for The Donald, the more they look like people who have voted Republican in the past. As Michael Brendan Dougherty, echoed by Ross Douthat, points out, they may belong disproportionately to the working and   classes, but they also belong to the   sectors of those classes. (They were voting in GOP primaries, after all.) And if common observation counts for anything, it is the lower social end of the Republican electorate where conservative views are most often to be found (though less on finance, say, than on crime.) Rod Dreher made exactly this point as early as January when, disagreeing with NR’s “Against Trump” special issue, he noticed that on visits to his family and in talks with neighbors, they agreed with statements by Trump that he felt were not only absurd but also plainly  . Yet they believed themselves to be conservatives in good standing and regarded their own views (and Trump’s) as well within the canon. Moreover, they were conservatives in good standing  —   just not conservatives who met the particular criteria of conservatism required by, well, by people like me who think, argue, and write about these things all the time. And until “policy wonks” were suddenly confronted with the fact that street conservatives differed from them quite seriously on entitlements, immigration, and much else, we were perfectly happy to assume their support or, if we noticed these differences, to believe that they would come around when we explained things carefully. It turns out, however, that they not only had different views but that they rooted these views in a different set of moral values that were both morally decent and broadly conservative. They were astonished to find themselves denounced by us as betraying or abandoning conservatism. RELATED: What Now, Conservatives? Take entitlements. Conservative writers have long pointed out that the present structure of such payments is fiscally unsustainable, destructive of   unrelated to the contributions beneficiaries have paid in over years, likely to undermine the dependent —  worker ratio on which the entitlements depend, and much else. All that is true, and as Jonah rightly points out, people like us are paid to tell the truth, the most relevant truth here being that if something can’t go on, it won’t go on. Most suburban conservatives don’t see it that way, however, and in particular they distinguish morally between different kinds of transfer payments. As Rod Dreher found when talking to his father, they think that welfare payments going to idlers are quite different from Social Security payments going to retirees. In the first case, they reward vice   encourage dependency in the second, they are the return on their investment in America as hard workers, good providers, helpful neighbors, potential draftees, and patriotic citizens. RELATED: The GOP’s Ideological Earthquake and the Aftermath, Admittedly, retirees receive far more in Social Security payments than their accumulated contributions could justify in purely investment terms. Often they know that, but they believe on moral grounds that those Americans who built the country, played by the rules, and defended it in war should be last in the line for making sacrifices. In addition, they have been officially told for   of a century that they will be secure in old age, and so they have legitimate expectations as a result. What prevents these facts from amounting to a   argument is mathematics: The cost of entitlements enjoyed by millions is higher than most other sorts of federal spending. So the    battle, refracted through political principles, becomes a clash between two conservative values: honest accounting and moral desert. There can’t be a knockout victory for either principle in a decent stable society. So if legitimate expectations have to be disappointed, that can only be as part of something like what James C. Bennett and Michael J. Lotus in America 3. 0 call the “Big Haircut,” in which all social groups sacrifice something in a grand fiscal compromise. Nothing like that will occur until a great deal of persuasion (from, among others, conservative wonks) has occurred, until   bargaining has taken place among all social groups and their political representatives, and until the sense of crisis is much more acute, spreading even to Democratic politicians. Those things will not happen for at least a decade. Many of today’s retirees will then be dead. So the slogan “protect entitlements” is a reasonable one both before and during any “Big Haircut” negotiations and any compromise outcome should and will reflect the conservative moral distinctions that at present underpin popular support for entitlements. Finally, most conservative intellectuals  —   excluding   libertarians  —   will probably accept such a measured approach as the best practical solution in an imperfect political economy. In other words, we Big Think merchants will end up not very far from these dangerous intruders who are stealing our party. Share article on FacebookshareTweet Another group of alleged invaders are   nationalists. It’s been a surprise to me to discover that nationalists are not conservatives in good standing, since they used to be the third leg of the conservative tripod, alongside social and economic conservatives. Some years ago when no one was looking, however, this tripod underwent a transplant, and national conservatives were quietly replaced by “defense conservatives. ” That is an absurdly thin and tepid concept (unless you happen to be a defense contractor, in which case the concept becomes a fat and passionate one). It probably reflects the nervousness of mainstream parties and moderate politicians about the full range of national conservative issues that include, as well as foreign policy and defense, crime, multiculturalism,   social disorder, and immigration. RELATED: After the GOP Darkness, the Dawn of Conservative Opportunity, National conservatism has a domestic concern for the social fabric as well as an   one for the national interest. (Indeed, I once suggested “  conservatives” as an alternative to national conservatives.) But because it takes a critical or skeptical view of leftist positions on crime, multiculturalism, etc. it is likely to invite accusations of racism, xenophobia, and much else from the very same leftists. These accusations apparently paralyze thought. For very few conservative politicians have shown enough savvy to reply that an accusation of white racism requires more evidence than that the person accused is white. Instead they remain more or less quiescent, avoiding controversy, in the face of mob violence to shut down political opponents and openly racist campaigns to delegitimize the police. All of these are matters of acute personal concern to ordinary Americans of all races, since they will be the ones who suffer if the social fabric shreds. In the aftermath of the Ferguson riots, there are signs that the police are holding back from proactively enforcing the law (that, is from taking the “broken windows” approach) thereby enabling a serious rise in urban crime. Regular Americans, especially ordinary conservatives, are increasingly anxious as the crime and disorder spread and as the Democrats almost flagrantly refuse to confront either the evils themselves or their political allies who are pushing them. Not only, therefore, is the salience of domestic “nationalist”     issues rising with everyday conservatives it is also forging a link between them and conservative intellectuals. Heather Mac Donald, one of the most effective national conservatives writing today, was almost alone for some time in reporting and analyzing the   campaign against the police. Others, at NR and elsewhere, have come to follow her lead. Michael Barone noticed an eerie similarity between the 1960s and ’70s and today: In both periods, liberals discussed crime and other social evils almost wholly in terms of white racism, and partly as a result they lost every election from 1968 to 1992 (with the exception of 1976.) The political impact he highlighted is prompting others to look again at these issues as potential  . And immigration, the issue that Trump exploited as the   of his campaign, demonstrates that these national issues are reshaping conservative and Republican politics in an unexpected way. Until recently there have been two political platitudes on this topic: that immigration divided the conservative grassroots from the GOP donor class and national leadership, and that this division was mimicked by a lesser split, within the conservative intelligentsia, between those who were more and those were less in favor of “open borders. ” In fact, the split in the conservative intelligentsia has been gradually resolving itself in favor of those who favor a smaller intake of   migrants. That position, adopted by NR in 1991 and held by us ever since, is now the dominant position on the intellectual right. It unites the national voters in the wider electorate with most writing conservatives. RELATED: Does a Conservative Reformation Loom on the Horizon? What the primary campaign did was to isolate in public view those who were committed to oppose any serious control of   immigration (and, by extension, to oppose the conservative position on other   issues)  —   namely, the donor class, the party leadership, the Chamber of Commerce conservatives, and, for months of the campaign, all the candidates except Trump who were unbelievably slow in responding to electoral incentives (i. e. votes) rather than financial ones (i. e. donations.) They are exposed as representing a narrow set of economic interests  —   essentially corporate America in libertarian camouflage  —   and offering social and national conservatives rhetorical slogans rather than practical reforms. In effect, they wanted a tripod resting on one leg. And they fell. What made their fall all but inevitable was that they were selfish, narrow, and unimaginative in their policy thinking  —   fighting for   immigration and repeating outdated slogans (‘the party of Jack Kemp”) rather than thinking about how to redesign opportunities for the new world of automation, family enterprises, independent contracting, and desktop industrialization. (See Bennett and Lotus again, and, in the Australian journal I edit, “Populism Rising,” by Peter Murphy.) RELATED: What Has Conservatism Ever Done for Us? A Great Deal, Actually, And it wasn’t a true fall, either, but a temporary loss. They have lost a nearly monopoly control of the GOP (and to a lesser extent, control of the definition of conservatism) not to invaders from outside but to conservative Republicans who suddenly started voting for their opinions rather than for their incumbents. In fact there are far fewer “invaders” (from the   segments of the working class) than I and most other commentators believed at the start of his campaign. That may change, but what we are currently seeing is less a takeover by outsiders than a “reunification” of the party as its disillusioned supporters were suddenly given hope that they might be heard once again. That’s not the best news for the GOP electorally, but it offers the prospect that a   GOP will find it easier either to govern or to rethink. More Conservatism The shocking speed of entrenchment, c. Civil Asset Forfeiture: Where Due Process Goes to DieA Conservative Brain (and Excellent Teacher) All of these reflections are prompted not by Trump but by those who voted for him  —   and no less by those who voted for Cruz. Both men led revolutions and both attracted significant levels of support. Between them, they won   of the votes on the right. Both will influence the GOP in the next decade or two. Those who despair of the effect that Trump’s nomination will have on the GOP should consider a few simple points. A presidential nominee only borrows his party until the election. If he loses the election, he loses the party, too. If he wins the election but is a failure  —   and the odds are stacked against the possibility that a candidate such as Trump, without the full support of his party, could succeed as president  —   he loses the party a little later. If he wins the election and has a successful presidency, he probably reshapes the party in his own image.

{"article": " My loving parents taught me how to speak, but they also taught me silence. I only know that my father voted for Trump because my mother  —   a Clinton supporter  —   asked on the evening of November 8, hours after they voted. They had not otherwise spoken about politics during the election season.     Nearly everyone I have spoken to has said that at least one of their family members voted for Trump too. Many weren’t even Trump supporters; they were “Never Hillarys. ” But that means little now that Trump is  . Growing up in Miami, Florida, where my parents still live, I was happily surrounded by different languages and cultures and more diversity than most places in the United States possess; as a white woman, I was the minority. I learned to speak Spanish at the grocery store and local bakery and my friends’ houses. Trump represented a dismissal of many of those historically marginalized cultures I had grown to love and feel a part of. I voted for Clinton because she seemed to represent equality for women and people of color, but more so because she did not represent the Islamophobic, homophobic, sexist, and racist thinking that Trump does. Almost everyone in the city of Boston, where I now teach and live, voted with this in mind too.     How was it possible that my own father voted for Trump?     I didn’t talk to my dad about Trump before the election Nearly every day for the past year, I worried how my father, who had lived in South Carolina until his late 20s, would vote. Deep down, I knew the answer, but I naively maintained my optimism. I often scanned his Facebook page, hoping not to find Trump propaganda. Most of his posts seemed harmless, often about his alma mater and their upcoming football games. He is often silent about politics. He never “likes” my Facebook posts about immigration or institutional racism or human rights. He only “likes” photos of me and posts about my personal achievements. Once, when he uncharacteristically shared an article about “illegal immigrants,” I commented and expressed my disagreement. He never commented back.     I was not surprised that my father had voted for someone who wanted to build a wall; I knew my father believed that immigrants must “do it the right way” and that they “need to assimilate into our society and help, not hurt, our country. ”  But the United States is born of immigrants; my father is here because his ancestors fled Scotland in the 1700s  —   fled poverty, war, perhaps even sought asylum. Trump’s mother is a Scottish immigrant too, a fact he often ignores; his paternal grandparents are German immigrants who claimed they were Swedish in order to avoid conflict with Jewish friends and customers. And, of course, Trump is married to an immigrant. How can we not remember our roots?  Can’t Trump voters see we are all human beings, some born into peace but so many into war? Can’t they see that white American citizens specifically live within a system that has handed them privilege for centuries, deluding them into believing they have done more than others to earn it? Can’t they see that this privilege is founded on years and years of slavery and oppression? That reaching out a hand to those who have been robbed in ways white American citizens never have is different from being taken advantage of?    I did not say any of this to my father before the election. Perhaps I feared that such questions would destroy our relationship. But does that mean I value one human life more than I do millions? What does that say about me? After Trump won, we had our first true talk about politics  —   ever A few days after the election, my father and I had the first true conversation we’ve ever had about politics. After Trump was elected, my frustration and anger was stronger than ever. I wanted to open some imaginary door at the back of everyone’s skulls, peer inside, and try to understand the engineering of their thoughts. A conversation with my dad  —   however belated  —   seemed like a first step at doing that. Still, my heart raced just thinking about talking to him. I was eager to hear his responses, but I was also eager to prove him wrong.  “I have to admit, I was scared to talk to you about this,” I said. “I know you probably weren’t, but I was. ” “No, no,” he said. “I was very nervous to talk about this with you too. ” Our shared emotion slowed my heartbeat, steadied my hands. “This country gives everyone the opportunity to succeed,” my father said, “but to succeed, each individual has to take responsibility for their own destiny. Less excuses and more work is the answer to their success. ”     “But not everyone is given equal opportunity yet,” I said. “No matter what the law claims to uphold. ”  “I understand,” he said. “And I’d have to do more thinking and reading on that to properly respond. ”  My hands shook again as I asked him if he ever reads my posts about political issues.   “I read them,” he said. “I sometimes feel uncomfortable, but I always respect your views and values, and I support your right to voice your opinions. Your views make me open up my thinking and consider the conditions that others have to deal with. You have challenged me to reconsider many philosophical issues. ” I was relieved that those articles had at least affected his thinking, but they clearly had not affected his actions. “I’m hoping [Trump] will talk less and listen more”  When I asked him to explain his reasons for voting for Trump, my father said he thought Obama’s presidency “has taken our country to the brink of bankruptcy. ” He said, “Something has to be done to bring back fiscal responsibility. We can’t just keep overspending and trying to make up for the reckless spending by increasing taxes. We need to bring manufacturing back to the United States from other countries. We need to give US businesses the breaks that are necessary to keep them here, rather than giving the breaks to foreign manufacturers. This will help our economy and provide jobs for our workers. I believe that Clinton would have continued Obama’s reckless spending and weak foreign policies and would have taken our country so far down that we might never have recovered. ”    “I respect and share your desire to ensure economic stability,” I said.  “It’s not all about economics, though,” he said. “Obama’s problematic dealings with Israel and his endorsement of countries that have vowed to take down the US scare me most. ”  “I understand the importance of those issues and, truly, I don’t know enough about Obama’s foreign policy to speak on it,” I said. “But more than anything, I cannot bring myself to prioritize those economic and international issues over the daily injustices and violence inflicted upon marginalized people and encouraged by Trump’s reckless rhetoric and thinking. ” “[Trump is] not a seasoned politician,” he said. “And he unfortunately says whatever is on his mind without thinking. I’m hoping he will talk less and listen more. ”  I told my father that I hope Trump will do more listening too. But that Trump says what is on his mind and that what is on his mind are Islamophobic, homophobic, sexist, and racist ideas is the ultimate reason to not vote for Trump. His decisions will surely be affected by that thinking. And so will all of those marginalized people for whom we’ve only recently begun to establish equal rights and protection. When I asked what my father thought of Trump’s bigoted remarks, he said, “Trump can be an idiot, but Hillary is truly dangerous. I believe Trump is smart enough to surround himself with highly qualified people who will advise him against such remarks. He has made some really stupid statements, which Hillary’s campaign has naturally made the most of. Hillary had a cast of thousands planning every word she has spoken and has spent a tremendous amount of money trying to overcome her shortcomings. ”    He also said he believes Trump’s endorsements from groups like the Ku Klux Klan are disgusting.  “But believing this disgusting does nothing to stop the violence they undoubtedly encourage,” I said. “Believing Clinton more dangerous than Trump, who has provoked sexual predators and bigots of all kinds, suggests a blindness  —   whether willful or not  —   we cannot ignore. ”  “I pray that none of those marginalized people are endangered,” my dad said. “Truly, I hope that Trump can make the pendulum swing back again from where it currently stands on the left. I hope we can find a middle ground, not swing too far right again and into a place where human rights are at risk. I really do. ”  “I know,” I said. “But I don’t think that’s a risk that anyone should be willing to take. ” “I always thought we were the greatest country on Earth, and I still do”  My father turned 70 last year. I wished him a happy birthday on the phone and later on his Facebook page, where I found another rare message he had shared, this one from a veterans group: “Never Forget. In Memory, 1959 to 1975, 58, 479 brothers and sisters who never returned from Vietnam War. ”  I can’t imagine what it’s like for my father to live with the memories of his time as a medic in Vietnam, but I’ve tried. He has always been present and loving, but he rarely discusses sensitive issues. It seemed like he’d been hoarding his thoughts and feelings for so many years that when I wondered about his concealed memories, I imagined them buried alive inside his head, tapping on the corners of his skull with tiny pickaxes, inmates trying to excavate their way out.     Because we had never talked about it, I assumed that he had tuned out Vietnam, or perhaps put that film on pause. I always thought part of him remembered  —   couldn’t not remember  —   and that he needed that pain to have been for something. If he could justify his grief, memories of grenades blowing off his buddies’ limbs and shrapnel shooting up his own legs, by continuing to “protect” this country  —   keep “illegals” out; keep Americans and their money and their land “safe”  —   then perhaps his trauma wouldn’t have been for nothing.  But when I asked my father about this after the election, he refused my theory.  “My experience in Vietnam didn’t change my views of America. I always thought we were the greatest country on Earth, and I still do,” he said. “I have always loved my country. I’m sure this is due to my family’s values and the values of the community where I grew up. I’ve never been given a reason not to love the United States of America. ” That might be the most important part of his response: Like most white, heterosexual, cisgender men, he has never been oppressed by his country.  When I mentioned this, I sensed our conversation was veering into rocky terrain. We were silent for a moment. I didn’t press. I didn’t think my father would talk to me about politics for the first time while also deeply considering his privilege. But it’s a conversation we still must have.   I think Trump votes are the result of pain  —   but they’ve also created deep pain Although my father claimed that Vietnam did not influence his vote, I still believe that everyone who voted for Trump likely has that something, that painful reason that compelled them to vote for him, that makes them need this country and its xenophobia in order to excuse a different pain. Protect America to make fallen soldiers matter. Protect America to make my mother’s job loss matter. Protect America to protect the excuse for killing more people  —   by continuing war, or by ignoring human rights issues.     But these responses to pain  —   these Trump votes  —   have inflicted a new pain. For many of us, we are mourning as we would a national tragedy.  At the end of our conversation, my father said, “The older I get, the more I realize I don’t know. More than ever before, I work now to really understand what is behind the actions of people. The one thing I will never be able to accept is negativity. ”  Perhaps I, too, had not been thinking enough about what I don’t know. Believing that the majority of our country had been thinking the way most of Boston had been was naive. After my conversation with my father, I realized that my own bubble might have prevented me from understanding other parts of the country, just as their bubbles might have stopped them from understanding me. I still strongly disagree with my father and Trump voters, but our conversation revealed, among many implicit biases, the danger of these   “coastal” and “rural” bubbles and the power and necessity of open dialogue. Sometimes those dialogues are hardest when they include the ones we love, but not engaging in them is a problematic exercise of privilege.  This conversation with my dad seems to signal a true willingness to listen, but how old must we be to truly understand each other? How old must we be to remedy mistrust of politicians and economic insecurity and scary foreign policies without electing a president like Trump?

[“The formula proposed by Secretary Kerry is impossible and does not correspond with reality. For 25 years Israel tried similar formulae but instead of peace we got islands of terror,” said Hotovely in a statement emailed to Breitbart Jerusalem.  “At the end of the day a resolution won’t be reached through speeches or unilateral moves at the UN.

He said that peace required a   Palestinian state, with a full end to Israeli military occupation, and normalization of Israel’s relations with its neighbors. Controversially, Kerry’s peace plan also includes Jerusalem as the capital of “the two states”  —   an outcome that Israel has not accepted, except in the peace terms offered at Camp David in 2000, which the Palestinians rejected.

Two of Uber’s autonomous cars are already wheeling around San Francisco, but they are being driven manually while the company is ”taking steps to complete our application to apply for a DMV testing permit,” an Uber spokeswoman said. The California’s Department of Motor Vehicles confirmed it has held discussions with Uber to assist the company in applying for the   testing permit. Uber has not formally submitted the application, DMV spokeswoman Jessica Gonzalez said. Acquiring the proper permit would allow Uber to restart its   pilot in San Francisco, which was shuttered after just a week late last year. The state DMV requires that any company testing autonomous vehicles on public roads receive a permit. At least 23 other companies exploring   cars, including Alphabet’s GOOG. O.

Uber argued that its cars were not capable of driving ”without . .. active physical control or monitoring,” as California law defines autonomous vehicles, so did not require a permit. Uber’s cars require monitoring by a person in the driver’s seat. An engineer also sits in the passenger seat.  The pilot was  .

[Elias Velazquez made a decision to enlist in the U. S. Army after he graduated from Redlands High School, but his school’s policy states that students cannot decorate their graduation gowns or caps except for California Scholarship Federation chords and sashes, KTTV reported.  “It means something really honorable to me, it’s a whole new life transition to me,” Elias said. Elias and his father are hoping the policy can be changed. “It’s kind of defeating the purpose of achieving that greatness,” Joe said. “We push our kids to strive and try to be better and do the best they can and then we tell them at their grad ceremony, ‘We need you all to be the same because we don’t want to hurt anyone else’s feelings. ’” His father, Joe, posted about the situation on social media to “open community dialogue” about the situation. “We’re simply trying to open some community dialogue and get people to understand some rules are okay to change,” Joe said. The Redlands School District said the reason for the rules is to promote fairness and has nothing to do with not supporting the military. “We are totally supportive of our men and women in the military.

{"article": " (CNN) When Andrea Hood saw the window, she knew it might be her only chance to survive. ”The Hunt With John Walsh” airs Sundays at 9 p. m.   on CNN. Got a tip? Call     (In Mexico: 0188000990546) or click here. Abducted two days earlier by two men she didn’t know, the    had spent most of the previous 48 hours chained to a bed in a room with a barred window. Held captive, she was tortured and raped repeatedly. But on a trip to the bathroom, she spotted another window, this one without bars.   ”That was my first bit of hope, like, ’Oh, I can maybe get out,’” Hood said of the moment on CNN’s ”The Hunt with John Walsh.” Her captors had wanted her to read a book about subservient women. She told them she would, and they unchained one of her hands to turn the pages. Left alone, she quickly freed her arm and other legs, grabbed one of the many firearms around the house and ran for the window, for freedom. She smashed the window with the gun, climbed through the broken glass and started running. ”One of the guys was yelling, ’Get her, get her, she can’t get away!’ ” Hood said.  ”I ran down the street hysterically crying, and bleeding all over. I was scared that they were literally right behind me.” CNN’s John Walsh believes Hood’s decisive action that night may be the reason she’s alive today. ”Here’s a vulnerable    girl that was smart enough, tough enough, had the presence of mind to say, ’I’m going to stay alive. I’m going to look for that chance,’ and that’s what saved her life,” he said. Inside the torture house, Hood found her way to the police and learned she was in Hillsboro, Oregon, 17 miles west of Portland, where she had been picked up by the men two days earlier.  It was 1990. Hood had been working as a prostitute on the streets of Portland to pay for her drug habit. It was around 2 or 3 in the morning when the men pulled up in a small pickup truck. ”Before I knew what was even happening, I was in the back of the truck, chained to the bed of the truck, and with a pillowcase on my head and duct tape on my mouth,” Hood told ”The Hunt.” Now she had been treated for her injuries, and was driving around with law enforcement, leading them back to the torture house she had escaped only hours earlier. There, the police found the broken window with the rifle Hood used to break it outside on the ground. Inside, they discovered more evidence supporting her account, including Polaroid photos of other women in bondage, as well as photos of Hood. After searching the Hillsboro house, police arrested the home’s owner, Vance Roberts, and his   Paul Jackson. That night, the pair had driven their pickup truck to a hospital, where Roberts received medical attention for a cut on his arm. In his version of events, Hood had been trying to steal from them, which is why she jumped out the window and how Vance got his injury. The photos? Old girlfriends, he claimed. A previous victim steps forward, To this day, many of the other women in those photos have not been located or identified. One has: Michaelle Dierich. Like Hood, she was a Portland prostitute with a drug habit.  Two years before Hood’s ordeal, Dierich went through almost the same experience: abducted by two men in a pickup truck, chained up in a closet, sexually tortured and brutalized for days. After a week of this treatment, the younger man threw a hood over her head again and put her back in the truck.  Dierich assumed they were planning to kill her. Instead, she was dropped off on a street in Portland. Dierich went to the hospital and was interviewed by police. She filled out a report and submitted a rape kit. But she could not tell them where she’d been taken, or by whom.  Lacking enough evidence to launch a detailed investigation, the report was filed away and nothing else happened    until Hood’s case came to light. The Hillsboro police found Dierich with the help of the Portland police. She identified Roberts and Jackson as her abductors from 1988. Armed with two witnesses and hard evidence, prosecutors charged the brothers with kidnapping and rape.  A trial date was set, but in February 1991, Roberts and Jackson, who were free on bond, fled. Roberts returns to face justice, In September 2006, after 15 years on the run, Vance Roberts unexpectedly walked into the Washington County Jail and turned himself in.  He claimed to have been living under bridges in Portland, but police didn’t believe his story.  They were unsuccessful in getting any more information from him.  At his trial, Roberts insisted the women had stayed with him voluntarily.   Hillsboro sergeant Bruce Parks recalled the trial: ”The defense tried to victimize the two women. They may have committed a small crime by working on the street as a prostitute, but they never agreed to be kidnapped. They’re still human beings.” The jury didn’t buy it, and after finding Roberts guilty, sentenced him to 108 years in prison.  Hood said she feels vindicated by the verdict. ”[H]e gets to spend the rest of his life in a situation of subservience. He’s told when to use the bathroom, when to eat, what he can do, just like they had planned for me, and I felt like that was just.” On the day of the sentencing, Dierich took the stand and confronted Roberts about the women in the photos whose identities and whereabouts are still unknown.  ”You brutalized me you terrorized me. You left me mentally and emotionally crippled beyond words or expression.   ”It wasn’t just me, though. Indeed there were many other victims, more victims than we may know about today.  ”Everybody knows about the 10 other victims. So, I’d like to know where their bodies at?” The hunt for Paul Jackson, Since his return in 2006, Vance Roberts has never turned on his brother, or said anything about Paul Jackson’s whereabouts.  Jackson is still on the run, 23 years since he jumped bail.   Deputy U. S. Marshal John Moody hopes the exposure given to the case by CNN’s ”The Hunt” will bring forth new leads. ”The biggest thing that we’re looking for is someone to come forward that they’ve, maybe this has happened to them and they escaped from it,” he said. ”We’d like to hear from them. They may have a piece to the puzzle to get this creature off the streets.” Paul Jackson has a scar on his stomach from having his appendix removed. Jackson has lived in both Arizona and Hawaii and has a background in electronic and automotive work.

{"article": " (This version of the story corrects to add dropped ”former” from Berlusconi’s title in paragraph four) By John Irish and Agnieszka Flak   Vivendi ( ) said on Monday it holds just over 3 percent of Mediaset ( ) and could raise that to as much as 20 percent in a move the Italian broadcaster’s top investor called a first step toward launching a hostile takeover bid for the company. The announcement only aggravates a   feud between the French media giant, led by chairman and biggest shareholder Vincent Bollore, and the Italian broadcaster controlled by the family of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. The two companies have been at loggerheads since July when Vivendi backed out of an agreement that would have given it control of Mediaset’s   division Premium and handed the two firms 3. 5 percent stakes in each other. Buying into Mediaset is part of Bollore’s strategy to expand into southern Europe and transform the French company into an integrated European media powerhouse.  ”Vivendi intends to carry on its purchase of shares in Mediaset, depending on market conditions, to become, if possible, the second industrial shareholder in Mediaset, which to begin with could represent 10 to 20 percent of Mediaset’s capital,” it added. Berlusconi’s investment holding Fininvest, which controls Mediaset via a 34. 7 percent stake, lashed out at Vivendi, accusing it of trying to depress the company’s share price to then launch a ”hostile takeover” at a discounted price.  ”Vincent Bollore and Vivendi have shown what their true intentions towards Mediaset were from the very start,” it said. Fininvest added it does not intend to diminish its role as  Mediaset’s main shareholder and would use all means to block what it considered a ”very serious deception” of market rules. Bolloré, a key shareholder of Italian investment bank Mediobanca, has built a reputation over the years as a corporate raider, resorting to different strategies to take control of businesses. Vivendi is already the top shareholder at phone group Telecom Italia ( ) with a stake of around 24 percent and some bankers have spoken of plans to combine the two Italian firms. All parties have repeatedly denied such speculation.  Mediaset, which is already suing Vivendi for damages over the   deal, echoed Fininvest’s comments, adding it had been unaware of Vivendi’s stake building until the statement.  Vivendi said in October it was no longer keen on finding an amicable solution to the dispute following several accusations by Mediaset. ”Given that the strategic industrial partnership . .. goes beyond what’s at stake in this dispute, Vivendi announces that it has gone over the 3 percent threshold in Mediaset’s capital and now holds 3. 01 percent,” it said on Monday.

Hamilton, 32, is an employee at the Joint Staff Support Center, a Defense Information Systems Agency spokesperson confirmed to Fox News. Hamilton has been charged with capital murder of a police officer and   murder for the death of Ashley Guindon, 28, and two counts of malicious wounding of a police officer and two counts of use of a firearm in commission of a felony.  He’s being held without bond ahead of an expected Monday arraignment. “This is a sad day for everybody in this room,” Prince William County Commonwealth Attorney Paul Ebert said during a Sunday news conference. “It’s a sad day for law enforcement. ” Officials said Hamilton shot and killed Guindon and wounded Officer Jesse Hempen, 31, and Officer David McKeown, 33, when they responded to a domestic disturbance call early Saturday evening. McKeown, a   veteran of the force, was Guindon’s field training officer. Both Hempen and McKeown remained hospitalized Sunday, though authorities wouldn’t detail the extent of their injuries. “We are certainly led to believe their recovery will be full they’re not at risk of   injuries,” Prince William County Police Chief Steve Hudson said. “But doctors have been very cautious to tell us there’s a long road ahead. ” After Guindon, Hempen and McKeown were shot, additional officers responded and were able to secure Hamilton’s surrender without further incident. When they entered the home, however, cops found Hamilton’s wife, Crystal Hamilton, shot dead. The couple’s    son was also in the home, unharmed. He’s currently in the care of family and friends. While Guindon was on her first shift as an officer, she had a long history with the unit, Hudson said. She interned with the department in the forensics service section while attending graduate school in 2011, and later applied and was accepted as a police officer. But during her initial field training period in June, she chose to resign for personal reasons, which Hudson did not disclose. Guindon, however, reapplied and the department rehired her earlier in February. She was sworn in the day before she was killed. “When she came back and reapplied, we were struck by her passion to do this job,” Hudson said. “She did share with us, when we rehired her, she felt like she still wanted to do this job. She couldn’t get it out of her blood. It was something she felt she could pour herself into. ” Guindon had also served in the U. S. Marine Corps Reserve for six years, Hudson said. Her death was just the fourth line of duty death for the department since 1970 and she was only the second officer to be killed during a felony crime in the department’s history, the previous instance coming in 1990.

So it’s something of a relief, says the British author, that his latest work  —   completed at 1am one Tuesday morning before a car arrived to take him to the airport to catch a flight to Norway  —   won’t be seen by anyone until 2114. Mitchell is the second contributor to the Scottish artist Katie Paterson’s Future Library project, for which 1, 000 trees were planted two years ago in Oslo’s Nordmarka forest. Starting with Margaret Atwood, who last year handed over the manuscript of a text called Scribbler Moon, each year for the next 100 years an author will deliver a piece of writing which will only be read in 2114, when the trees are chopped down to make paper on which the 100 texts will be printed. Each author  —   their names revealed year by year and chosen by a panel of experts and Paterson, while she is alive  —   will make the trek to the spot in the forest high above Oslo, where they will surrender their manuscripts in a short ceremony. “It’s a little glimmer of hope in a season of highly depressing news cycles, that affirms we are in with a chance of civilisation in 100 years,” said Mitchell. “Everything is telling us that we’re doomed, but the Future Library is a candidate on the ballot paper for possible futures. It brings hope that we are more resilient than we think: that we will be here, that there will be trees, that there will be books, and readers, and civilisation. ” Mitchell said he found writing the book “quite liberating, because I won’t be around to take the consequences of this being good, or bad . .. But I’m sandwiched between Margaret Atwood, and no doubt some   other writer [yet to be revealed]. So it better be good. What a historic fool of epochal proportions I’d look, if they opened it in 2114 and it wasn’t any good. ” Usually, says Mitchell, who was shortlisted for the Man Booker for his novels number9dream and Cloud Atlas, he “polishes and polishes” his writing. “Actually I  . But this was very different  —   I wrote up to the wire. So the first   were polished, and the final third I didn’t have time. And it was a liberation. ” Contributors to Future Library can write whatever they like  —   poems, short stories, novels or    —   in any language. The only thing asked of them is that they do not speak about their writing, show it to anyone, and that they deliver one hard copy and one digital copy at the handover ceremony in Oslo. Writing about the project, the curator Lisa Le Feuvre said: “We have to trust that they have written  —   imagine saying yes, and then time running out. Nobody in your lifetime would know that you had just repeated the alphabet 100 times over. Does it matter if a writer is deemed lazy when they can’t hear the judgment with their own ears?” Future Library creator Paterson, whose past works have involved her mapping dead stars and compiling a slide archive of the history of darkness through the ages, asked the writers to tackle “the theme of imagination and time, which they can take in so many directions”. Mitchell revealed only the name of the manuscript, From Me Flows What You Call Time, during a Saturday ceremony in the Norwegian woods next to where Paterson’s 1, 000 trees are planted. The title is taken from a piece of music by Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu, but other than admitting that “it’s somewhat more substantial a thing than I was expecting” the author would say nothing more. Handing over his text in the forest, sheltered from the intermittent rain by an umbrella and amid the   shoots of 1, 000 pine trees, Mitchell read his damp audience of children and adults a short story and William Wordsworth’s A slumber did my spirit seal. Its ending, “Rolled round in earth’s diurnal course   With rocks, and stones, and trees” felt appropriate in this small section of forest, carpeted with blueberry bushes, which will be carefully tended to for the next 98 years before it is turned into Future Library’s manuscripts. “How vain to suppose the scribblings of little old me will be of enduring interest to future generations. Yet how   and understated, to slave over a manuscript that nobody will ever pat you on the back for and say: ‘Nice one’ or ‘God, I loved the bit where she did that and he did this . ..’” Mitchell wrote in a piece for the Future Library. His manuscript, now delivered, will be sealed and placed alongside Atwood’s in a   room in Oslo’s new public library, which will open in 2019. Watched over by a trust of experts until it is finally printed, it is now, says the novelist, “as gone from me as a coin dropped in a river”.", "prop": 0.16841341669871074},

Because it turns out, it wasn’t the Russians. It was this young guy who, I suspect, was disgusted by the corruption of the Democratic National Committee. He’s been killed, and apparently nothing serious has been done to investigative his murder. So I’d like to see how [Robert S.] Mueller [III] is going to define what his assignment is. ”    Mueller has been appointed as a special counsel to oversee a federal investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and any Russian collusion with Trump’s campaign.   [Family of slain DNC staffer fights back against conspiracy theories with    letter]   With no pushback from the Fox hosts, Gingrich shared innuendos that got new life last week after Rod Wheeler, an occasional contributor to Fox News whom a conservative donor had paid to probe Rich’s death, told local Fox affiliate WTTG 5 that he had new evidence. On Monday, Wheeler claimed to have sources at either the FBI or the D.

(Claritza   Washington Post)   By Thursday, after   questioning from CNN and NBC News, Wheeler had largely recanted his story, and Rich’s family had rejected Wheeler’s most explosive claim  —   that Rich’s laptop was in police custody. But Friday, and over the weekend, Fox News host Sean Hannity continued to suggest that Rich was killed in a  .   [A conspiratorial tale of murder, with Fox News at the center]   Like Hannity, Gingrich confidently made claims about Rich that have not been proven and that the family has denied.

There is no evidence that he was “disgusted by the corruption of the Democratic National Committee,” though last week, amateur sleuths falsely claimed that Rich had posted online as “pandas4bernie. ” (He may have tweeted as “panda4progress. ”) There’s also no evidence that Rich contacted WikiLeaks. Until this week, conspiracy theorists had suggested that the hacker Guccifer 2. 0 used Rich to get into DNC servers, based on possibly altered direct messages between Guccifer 2. 0 and a model named Robbin Young. The new theories, which were covered on Fox News even as the source recanted, rely not on criminal evidence but on the fact that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange offered a reward for information about Rich’s killing and gave a meandering   when asked whether Rich was his source. But as the investigation into Russia’s role has picked up steam, Hannity and others have latched on to any suggestion that a source might emerge and link Rich to the DNC hack, though the FBI had spotted   hacks as long ago as September 2015.

{"article": "   I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. If you read articles about how to help someone with depression, you encounter a few common themes. Don’t tell people to “snap out of it. ” Don’t say you know what they feel like. Don’t act as though they have a choice in the matter. Where Is the Heir to Rage Against the Machine? The view of depression as a clinical, chemical phenomenon —  an illness —  is, theoretically, commonly accepted. Still, many people with depression say that it’s often talked about in unhelpful ways. Music, perhaps, can help. Deep, enduring sadness has been a muse for rock artists for most of the genre’s lifespan, but this year has provided a fascinating crop of young talents finding fresh ways to make art about the topic. The most vibrant examples are Mitski, a      and Car Seat Headrest, a Seattle band. “Catharsis” doesn’t seem like the right word for what they’re doing they’re dissecting feelings, trying to convey how they work and what effect they have on a person’s life. The joy of the music is partly in recognition —  both of truth and of a sharp writer’s talents. Mitski’s Puberty 2 opens with a dull jackhammering pulse, maybe meant to represent a kind of looming dread. The song is called “Happy,” and she sings about the title emotion as a   stand who disappears from her apartment while she’s in the bathroom, leaving her to clean up candy wrappers and other detritus from his visit. Incongruously loud saxophones blare to horrifying effect, but Mitski’s chorus, like many on the album, is surprisingly  . It’s a very smart take on the idea of emotional absence, and in her press materials Mitski explained what exactly she’s going for: “Happiness is up, sadness is down, but one’s almost more destructive than the other. When you realize you can’t have one without the other, it’s possible to spend periods of happiness just waiting for that other wave. ” The theme holds across highlights like “Fireworks,” where an acoustic guitar briskly strums out a chord progression that creates a feeling of melting while Mitski calmly fantasizes sadness fossilizing into “a slight grey in my eye. ” For the   reverie of “Thursday Girl,” she sings, “I’m not happy or sad, just up or down and always bad,” and on the short closer “A Burning Hill,” she describes how lack of control can coexist with perfect  : “I am the fire and I am the forest   I am a witness watching it. ” To cope, she’ll do nothing dramatic, just wear a white   so that she can, at least, “be neat. ” If Puberty 2 masterfully demonstrates how a certain kind of melancholy feels, Teens of Denial, the recent album from Car Seat Headrest, is a powerful companion piece for talking about its causes —  or its lack thereof. While Mitski’s songs manage to gut the listener while remaining small and sculptural, frontman Will Toledo works in the style of anthemic but   rock reminiscent of Modest Mouse or the Get Up Kids. It is surging,   music, but its lyrical concerns are precise, introspective, and often   in criticizing how society treats the congenitally sad. The opener “Fill in the Blank” uses the conceit of its title to suggest the interchangeability of emotional drains, while the chorus is from the point of view of   critics: “You have no right to be depressed   you haven’t tried hard enough to like it. ” The trope of the gloriously tortured artist gets sneered at on the jittery “Vincent”: Vincent van Gogh, Toledo informs us, has his picture on the Wikipedia page about clinical depression. On another standout, “Drunk   Whales,” Toledo sings about feelings as topography, and the metaphor is mirrored in the music’s veering from valleys of strumming to distorted, noisy peaks. The song’s title refers to two very different feelings —  leaving a party, and watching the   documentary Blackfish —  that lead to the same feeling of malaise. It’s a great insight, the notion that a small trigger can upend someone’s entire state. When I saw Mitski perform Wednesday night in Boston, she issued a warning from the stage: “I was reading Hamlet right until I came up here, which was a bad idea. It’s made me very morose. ” The news came with a laugh and an acknowledgment that it sounded like a cliché. As the audience then sang back the words she’d recorded on her most recent three albums, it made those words seem all the more extraordinarily specific. That was especially the case for “Last Words of a Shooting Star,” on which she tells of how sudden airplane turbulence makes her imagine what people will think of her bedroom after she’s dead —  all of which, conceivably, could be another metaphor for sadness that comes and goes without warning. But after just 45 minutes of intense performance, with a number of great Puberty 2 songs yet unplayed, the lights went up and Mitski left the stage. “She didn’t want to be up there tonight,” someone near me said. That, of course, was pure presumption —  “You actually don’t know me,” Mitski had earlier told an overeager crowd member. You can understand, though, why her songs might make people feel otherwise.", "prop": 0.2654705186063583},
{"article": " (CNN) Days after a raid on an al Qaeda compound in Yemen led to the first US military combat death under Donald Trump, the leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula released an audio message taunting the new American President. In an   recording, AQAP leader Qassim   condemned the January 29 raid, saying, ”The new fool of the White House received a painful slap across his face.”  The message was released online Saturday and translated by the SITE Intelligence Group. In the recording, Rimi also claimed ”dozens of Americans were killed and wounded,” a number starkly at odds with the US account, which reported the death of one Navy SEAL, Chief Petty Officer William ”Ryan” Owens. Three additional SEALs also were wounded. Rimi acknowledged the deaths of 14 men and 11 women and children in the raid, a joint counterterrorism effort between the United States and United Arab Emirates. A senior US military official told CNN on Monday that Rimi was a target of the operation. The recording was released after last week’s raid.

Awlaki was killed in 2011. Reprieve, a   nongovernmental organization, and a   human rights worker told CNN that at least 23 civilians were killed in the attack. ”When the Americans escaped, they dragged their killed and wounded, and they found no other alternative but to destroy their own planes so that it would not be proof of their scandal,” Rimi said. The senior US military official told CNN on Monday that intelligence collection wasn’t the only objective of the Yemen raid but that it had also targeted Rimi.  In the event Rimi wasn’t there, the US military believed it would find intelligence that would help lead to him, the official said.    the mission was not dependent on   being there, however, a senior US military official emphasized.  US Central Command, which oversees forces in the region, and the Pentagon are strongly denying   was an objective of the raid. On Tuesday, Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis said, ”There was never any intention, hope, anticipation or plan that he would be part of this operation.” ”It wasn’t a   target mission,” Col. John Thomas told CNN, referring to operations aimed at killing or capturing terrorist leaders. Thomas added no hard intelligence indicated a ”high possibility” Rimi was at the compound on the night of the raid, saying that Navy SEALs would have captured any leaders of the al Qaeda affiliate, including Rimi, as part of an   operation.  ”Anyone found on site would have been taken,” Thomas said. NBC first reported that Rimi was a target of the raid.  The chance to take out such a pivotal member of al Qaeda may explain the large allocation of resources used in the mission. Military botches release of video seized in Yemen raid, Raid missteps, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula fighters detected the SEAL team before it reached its objective, leading to an intense firefight. Following news of the raid, the military had said the goal of the mission was to gather intelligence on the al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen.
