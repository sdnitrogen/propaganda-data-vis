{"article": "BALTIMORE  —   After a string of   defeats, the prosecutors who were unable to win convictions of police officers in the death of Freddie Gray defended themselves on Thursday and sharply accused the city’s Police Department of undermining them. At a news conference the day after their boss, Marilyn J. Mosby, the state’s attorney for Baltimore, announced she was dropping charges against the three officers who still awaited trial, the lead prosecutors  —   both seasoned lawyers  —   said the police had failed to serve search warrants for the officers’ personal cellphones. The lawyers also echoed a charge made in court that a detective assigned to the case was sabotaging it. They disputed a contention by critics that they rushed to bring charges, and said they never doubted their theory of the case  —   or whether they had the evidence to win. “There was sufficient evidence for a rational juror to convict,” Michael Schatzow, deputy chief state’s attorney, told reporters crowded into a conference room in Ms. Mosby’s downtown suite. “We believed in these cases, and we were prepared to fight very hard for these cases. ” The appearance by Mr. Schatzow and Janice Bledsoe, a deputy state’s attorney, was the first time the prosecutors  —   who like all the lawyers, defendants and witnesses had been subject to a strict rule of silence imposed by the judge  —   spoke publicly, outside the courtroom, about a case that has torn apart this city and drawn national attention. The two appeared worn out and at times exasperated  —   “When it comes to frustration, I plead guilty,” Mr. Schatzow said  —   but offered a remarkable look into their thinking, and the potential conflicts between the police and prosecutors who usually work together. It is “extraordinarily unusual” for prosecutors to publicly criticize the police, said David Jaros, a law professor at the University of Baltimore. He said the trials highlighted the need  —   as Ms. Mosby suggested at her news conference on Wednesday  —   for independent investigators and prosecutors to handle police misconduct cases. “There is something problematic,” Mr. Jaros said, “when police officers are asked to investigate themselves and when local prosecutors are involved in these highly politicized,   prosecutions. ” The Police Department has stood by its investigation. In a statement released Wednesday, Commissioner Kevin Davis said “over 30 ethical, experienced and talented detectives worked tirelessly to uncover facts” in the case. A department spokesman said Thursday that the police would “not engage in public banter with our criminal justice partners. ” Mr. Gray, a    black man, was arrested on April 12, 2015, in the blighted West Baltimore neighborhood where he grew up. He sustained a fatal spinal cord injury and died a week later  —   one of a string of deaths around the country of black men at the hands of the police that prompted national outcry, and riots here. On May 1, with National Guard troops on patrol, Ms. Mosby announced that she was bringing criminal charges against six officers. Prosecutors argued that Mr. Gray was improperly arrested, and that he sustained the fatal injury during a ride in a police van, in part because officers failed to put a seatbelt on him and drove the van dangerously. But the first trial ended in a hung jury, and three more ended in acquittals issued by Judge Barry G. Williams of the Baltimore City Circuit Court, prompting the prosecution team to conclude they could not win convictions before him. In Maryland, defendants may choose whether to have a trial by judge or jury. Mr. Schatzow said prosecutors began investigating the circumstances around Mr. Gray’s injury in the days after it happened, and said it was not scattershot or rushed, adding, “I don’t think we felt that there was material that we overlooked. ” Legal experts have noted that timeline fell short of what is typical for federal inquiries, which last months if not years. But the prosecutors laid blame on the police, not themselves. Mr. Schatzow said the lead police detective involved in the inquiry, Dawnyell Taylor, “was doing things without notifying us, and doing things that were counter to what a primary detective should be doing,” and was removed from the case as a result of his complaints. But in court, she denied that she had been removed from the case. And Ms. Bledsoe said that while the police tried to get personal cellphones of the six officers, which might have shown their communications during and after the episode, the department “did not execute those warrants in the correct amount of time, and they expired. ” One of the biggest outstanding questions is what, precisely, happened to Mr. Gray. Some residents here, as well as neurologists who have watched the case from afar, have questioned whether he was injured not in the van, but during the initial arrest, when he was pinned to a sidewalk  —   a scene captured on video that was widely replayed. “Everybody who saw that acknowledged that he couldn’t use his legs properly,” said Mary Anne Whelan, a retired neurologist in Cooperstown, N. Y. who was one of several doctors who in interviews have questioned the narrative about Mr. Gray’s injury. “Somehow or other it’s gotten to be accepted that it happened in the van, but that’s wrong. ” But prosecutors said that video recordings of the arrest, which they said showed Mr. Gray raising his chin off the pavement and later standing on the back bumper of the police van, at least partly supporting his own weight, indicated that he had not yet sustained a paralyzing injury. In the end, Mr. Schatzow said, Ms. Mosby “correctly determined” that while there may have been enough evidence to persuade jurors, they would never convince Judge Williams that the officers had committed a crime  —   despite the judge’s history as a lawyer who once prosecuted police misconduct for the Justice Department. “We had to face the reality,” he said, “that defendants would select judge trials, and that this judge would try the cases. ”", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> BALTIMORE — After a string of defeats, the prosecutors who were unable to win convictions of police officers in the death of Freddie Gray defended themselves on Thursday and sharply accused the city’s Police Department of undermining them.

{"article": "By my count I have helped some 58 friends (including many colleagues in public radio) buy a car. That’s sort of funny, considering I didn’t buy a car until I was 37 years old and began reporting on the auto industry for NPR. On Saturdays over the last few years, I have gotten phone calls from friends at car dealerships asking for advice. It’s no small financial matter, when the average cost of a new car is roughly $33, 000. So if you are reading this while in a car dealership, do what I tell all my friends: Stand up! Leave the dealership! Do not buy a car today! JOIN NPR’S ’YOUR MONEY AND YOUR LIFE’ FACEBOOK GROUP, And before you return, take a look at these tips I’ve gathered from industry experts and public radio friends. ”I knew exactly what I wanted,” Muthoni Muturi, NPR editor, Your father may have always loved Hondas, and your grandmother may have always bought Crown Victorias. But it’s my job to keep up with the car companies, and I have a hard time keeping track of what’s good or bad. (And it’s not your father’s Oldsmobile, because they don’t make Oldsmobiles anymore.) ”Information is king,” says Jonathan Collegio of the National Automobile Dealers Association, or NADA. ”Consumers should do as much homework as possible,” he says, and ”have a sense of the market.” They shouldn’t be afraid to go to a dealership, he says, but they should come prepared. Start with data: Consumer Reports has a list of the best and worst cars. Car company rankings change all the time, and you might be surprised at what you learn  —   for instance, that Audi, Subaru, Mazda and Buick all rate higher than Honda for reliability. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, or IIHS, compiles safety data by car and make. Both sites promise unbiased   information about car reliability and safety.  In addition, there are   sites that help with reviews and pricing of cars. Here are just a few: Cars. com, Truecar. com, Kelley Blue Book, CARFAX. com, Autotrader. com, Costco Auto and NADA Guides. Michelle Singletary, a personal finance columnist with The Washington Post, warns that consumers should not ”set one toe in the dealership” before doing their homework. ”Don’t be satisfied with going around the block,” Karen Grigsby Bates, NPR correspondent, Five or 10 years ago when you bought your last car you were that much younger. Your body, your needs and your eyesight have changed. That’s why a test drive is so important. Drive the car in the conditions you would use it in  —   at night on a dark road, for instance, so you can test the lights and brightness of interior lamps. Rebecca Lindland, a senior analyst with Kelley Blue Book, points out that a test drive can help with dealing with family members who have disabilities. She also recommends bringing car seats and pet carriers with you. And she reminds shorter drivers to pay attention to sightlines and especially the   (which is the beam on the windshield to the left of the driver) it can obscure vision around curves. She also advises   buyers to pay attention to something known as the  . ”When you stand next to the car with the door open, look at how high the top of the seat is. That’s called the    —   where the top of the seat is,” she says. Where the   falls will give you a sense of ease of entry. If the top of a seat hits below your knees, for instance, you’ll have to stoop lower to get into the car. If the   hits around   it will be was easier to get in and out. The key is to feel comfortable in the vehicle. ”A car is not an impulse purchase,” Sonari Glinton, NPR business correspondent, At its most basic, purchasing a car is a financial decision that’s tied with emotion, and dealers will use tactics that play on your emotions. I would suggest separating the different decisions.   on one day. Figure out financing on another. Determine the best dealer on yet another. ”Remember, their job is to sell you a car today,” says Jack Nerad, executive editorial director and executive market analyst with Kelley Blue Book and author of The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Buying or Leasing a Car. ”If you don’t like the experience of how they are treating you, leave,” Nerad advises. ”You have all the power. Use it. Walk out the door.” Dealers often will make you feel like the deal you’re getting is scarce, says Camelia Kuhnen, a neuroeconomist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. That will make you feel like you need to buy a car even if it’s against your best judgment. ”You can easily survive without that particular car, at this particular dealership,” she says. Bringing a friend who will be dispassionate about the whole process and help advocate on your behalf is a good idea, Kuhnen adds. ”I was prepared to walk out and did. It was only a couple hundred dollars difference but I got the deal I wanted,” Greg Dixon, NPR producer for All Things Considered  ”If you can’t pay cash for it, you need to be asking yourself why [you’re] buying this car,” says Singletary, the personal finance columnist. She suggests checking with your local bank or credit union before you go the dealership. ”Negotiate purchase price not the monthly payment,” says Lindland of Kelley Blue Book. ”You can easily spend hundreds, even thousands of extra dollars by not paying attention to terms.” One final tip from Lindland: Avoid car terms that are over 60 months. ”Longer term loans help keep monthly payments low,” says Melinda Zabritski with Experian, the credit agency. But consumers should be very careful, she says, because ”it’s easy to find yourself upside down . .. dealing with negative equity should they choose to trade it in after only a few years.” Collegio of NADA says ”it’s good to shop around.” He advises that you get a rate from your local bank  —   the dealer will be able to match or meet it. His organization has a guide for auto financing at autofinancing101. org. Ask for incentives. Dealers and carmakers often offer cash incentives, preferable loan or lease terms, gifts and even coupons to encourage consumers to buy cars. Check the manufacturer’s website for incentives, and be sure to ask your salesperson. The last weekend of the month is when dealers have the biggest incentive to sell. If you’re interested in leasing, negotiate the purchase price of the car first. Deal with the   separately, advises Singletary. Buy less car than you need, and think used (often referred to as  ) to get the best deal. Once you decide on the car, stick with the decision. ”Don’t settle on color,” warns Bates, who’s a member of NPR’s Code Switch team. ”Every time I go outside and see that red car, it makes me happy.” When you walk to your car, it should make you happy. And don’t forget: You don’t have to buy a car today.

{"article": " In the days after the election of Donald Trump,    Ursula Garza began to think about planning her funeral. Garza, who lives in San Antonio, Texas, is an   diabetic. For years, she’d gone without health insurance, forced to beg for insulin  —   which could cost her as much as $600  —   from friends who worked in doctors’ offices and and from donation centers, picking up supplies vial by vial. Last April, she’d finally gotten coverage under the Affordable Care Act  —   a literal lifesaver, she said, that allowed her to get an insulin pump. But the effect of years without insurance had taken its toll: she lives with chronic pain, nerve damage, and vision problems. Like millions of Americans, Garza is now contemplating the possibility that she could lose her health insurance if Donald Trump follows through on his campaign promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act. If Obamacare goes, Garza, a single mother to an    daughter, doesn’t know how she would survive. “It’s very scary to me  —   the thought of him taking it away is just a nightmare,” she said. “There’s only so much a body can handle. If I find myself uninsured again, I don’t know what will happen. It sounds morbid, but I’ve been looking at funeral plans. ” The question of what   Trump will do with the Affordable Care Act is, like much of his presidential policy, up in the air. It has left many preparing for the worst: transgender people who say they are rushing to stock up on hormones or schedule reassignment surgeries, women who say they plan to get implanted birth control devices for fear the costs of monthly pills will become unaffordable again. “We have no idea yet” what will happen to the 20 million people who are currently insured on the exchanges, said Gary Claxton, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health care nonprofit. Under a Trump presidency, “whatever comes next will be pretty different, and how you get there has the potential for disruption. ” Late last week, after spending months on the campaign trail promising to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, he signaled that he was open to keeping some key parts of the law, like a ban on denying coverage because of   conditions. But despite some support on both sides of the aisle, retaining coverage for those with   conditions is far from simple, Claxton said. “In the ACA, all policies are available to anyone who wants them” regardless of   conditions, he said. “But that’s dependent on a lot of other things that allow it to work, like the individual requirement to have insurance and subsidies to bring healthy people into the market. Those things aren’t particularly popular. ” If the individual mandate is repealed, experts say, there will not be enough healthy people paying into the system  —   or paying penalties for lack of insurance  —   to cover the steep costs of insuring people who are already sick. Insurers would have to deny those sick people coverage, or, at the very least, force them into costlier insurance plans or those that don’t pay for conditions they already had. That deep uncertainty has weighed heavily on the minds of people like Garza, who have only recently adjusted to life with health insurance. “Right now I just don’t know,” Garza said. “Will there really be insurers that will offer plans for people like me, with   conditions, that I can afford?” Joel Walker, 30, of Dayton, Ohio, began to fix his rotting teeth after he got health care coverage for the first time in ten years under a Medicaid expansion. He’s waiting now to be fitted for dentures. “It should be the first time in  —   wow  —   a decade that I’ll be able to smile with a mouthful of teeth,” Walker said. Walker, who is also taking medication for a heart condition, said he has felt as though he was “inside a steel cage of depression” since the election, worrying what will happen if he loses access to his dentist, cardiologist, or the medicine he’s dependent on if the ACA is repealed. He voted for Hillary Clinton, but for the first time in 28 years, his county, Montgomery, flipped Republican. “To put it bluntly, I felt a little betrayed,” Walker said. For some, however, the looming end of the Affordable Care Act offers a shred of hope. Laura Mansour, a retired nurse in Bradford, Pennsylvania, got insurance through a state exchange but found she could no longer cope with the price of her insurance, which had a $638 monthly premium, a $7, 000 deductible and   that had climbed to almost $100 for a doctor’s visit. With no choice, she said, Mansour dropped her insurance this year, planning to go uninsured until her Medicare coverage kicks in. Mansour, like “everyone” in the   town where she lives, supported Donald Trump, partly out of a hope that he will bring jobs back to coal country and partly, she said, because she is counting on him to lower health insurance costs. “They need a whole new revamp,” Mansour said. “Everybody should be able to get health care, but I don’t think you should be penalized for not having it. ” In Belleville, Illinois, Rebecca Gabriel says her entire family has been touched by the Affordable Care Act. It’s allowed her to insure herself and her two children for just $35 a month, covering the costs of a monthly medication that has “changed” her son’s life. Without insurance, they would pay $236 for the medication alone. In the next town over, Gabriel’s niece, who has severe brain damage from a car accident, is reliant on ACA coverage. “That’s what we’re really freaking out about,” Gabriel said. “Because of Obamacare, they can’t put a lifetime cap on her insurance, they can’t boot her off because of a   condition. She was in a coma for more than a month  —   her hospital bills were well over $1 million. Obamacare has been a lifesaver for us. ”   ", "sentence": {"content": "<div> In the days after the election of Donald Trump, Ursula Garza began to think about planning her funeral.

{"article": " Wracked by arthritis, bitten by ticks, and murdered atop an icy mountain 5, 300 years ago, Otzi the “Iceman” also carried   bacteria, scientists reported on Thursday. The Heliobacter pylori bacteria was retrieved from the mummified stomach of the ancient    man killed by an arrow wound and frozen in the Alps, who was uncovered by hikers in 1991. H. pylori is now the oldest microbe to be genetically mapped. Otzi has been studied for two decades for insight into early Europeans  —   he died wearing elaborate fur clothing, armed with a copper axe, and covered with 61 tattoos (making him the oldest known tattooed man). Now researchers are examining his gut microbes, or microbiome, for more clues to the life and death of the Iceman. “He had a very rough life,” study lead author Frank Maixner of the European Academy of   in Italy told reporters at a telephone briefing. “We cannot be 100% certain he suffered gastric distress but we can say his immune system was reacting to the bacteria. ” Today, roughly half of all people worldwide are infected by H. pylori, which lives in the acidic human stomach and about 10% of the time causes ulcers. Varied strains of the bacteria are tied to populations across the world, with   Europeans afflicted by a unique one that appears to be a mixture of older African and Asian ones. But not Otzi, according to the new study, published in the journal Science. The complete genetic map, or genome, of the H. pylori bacteria found in his frozen stomach shows it belongs to an Asian strain of bacteria now largely confined to the guts of people living in northern India. That suggests the north Indian strain once belonged to most prehistoric Europeans, prior to an influx of farmers from the Middle East into the continent more than 4, 000 years ago. Those new arrivals likely carried the African H. pylori strain that mixed with the older Asian one to produce today’s signature European H. pylori bugs. “To actually sequence the genome of a pathogen this old is a dream come true,” ancient microbe expert Gary   of the University of Puerto Rico, who was not involved in the new study, told BuzzFeed News. “The beautiful thing is the paper sheds light on one hypothesis about ancient human migration, which is wonderful. ” While studies of human gut microbes, the microbiome, have run rampant in the last decade, the field of paleomicrobiology is only blooming now with the Otzi study,   added. “The microbiome is absolutely essential to what makes us human, we couldn’t survive without these microbes,” he said. “So to glimpse what they looked like a long time ago is really important. ” To sequence the genes of the ancient gut bugs, the researchers first retrieved samples of Otzi’s stomach lining and the   contents of his stomach, which previous researchers had shown contained last meals of goat, deer, and bread. Mixed in were DNA segments from H. pylori bacteria, which the team painstakingly knitted into a complete genetic map of the bugs. Poor preservation of Otzi’s stomach lining means the researchers couldn’t tell whether he suffered from ulcers. However, the scientists did find proteins expressed by the human immune system in reaction to an H. pylori infection. “He probably had some stomach issues,” Maixner said. H. pylori is probably as old as our species, Homo sapiens, perhaps dating back to 116, 000 years ago. (And around 50, 000 years ago, lions appear to have captured their own strain of the   bacteria by eating people.) Carried out of Africa by human migrations around 60, 000 years ago, today’s Northern Indian strain of H. pylori may reflect an ancient lineage of stomach bugs. In Northeast Africa a newer strain evolved within the last 52, 000 years, to later mix with the bugs today giving ulcers to people across Europe. “A real, but unintended, message here is that Europe has been the destination of many a migrant,” study author Yoshan Moodley of South Africa’s University of Venda told BuzzFeed News by email. “And that migration into and away from any place in the world is as old as mankind. ”   ", "sentence": {"content": "<div> Wracked by arthritis, bitten by ticks, and murdered atop an icy mountain 5, 300 years ago, Otzi the “Iceman” also carried bacteria, scientists reported on Thursday.

Knock it off. Now. Let’s go. Stop playing tennis. ” The officer is heard mentioning the “severe weather coming in” while Troicki looks skyward quizzically. Then Tomic comes over from the opposite side of the net. “Excuse me, sir? It’s not raining,” Tomic says. The policeman wheels on him and tries to get nose to nose with the    youngster. “Why are you getting so close to me?” Tomic asks. The officer by now is barking orders to “get off the court. ” The complete argument lasts for approximately one minute. The cop pictured does not belong to the Metropolitan Police Department; uniform characteristics such as sleeve chevrons and pants stripes appear to match with the United States Park Police, which also has jurisdiction in DC. Though it’s doubtful the patrolman is enough of an ATP Tour buff to know it, both players have suspect reputations. Troicki, 30, once was assessed a   ban for failing to provide an   blood sample.

A few dollars of the lost value might be attributable to launching a string of new features and changes that failed to catch on with users, including Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s leaden trial balloon about abandoning the signature feature of the platform, its   message size limit. Twitter has been bleeding users to other platforms for years, and probably isn’t going to win them back by transforming itself into a pale imitation of the platforms they departed for. Wall Street analysts are also said to be worried about Twitter cutting staff without bringing in any exciting new hires, Dorsey’s rather grim requests for patience with a slow turnaround process, years of clashes with outside developers, and the fact that Dorsey divides his attention between Twitter and another company he also manages as CEO.

People are sincerely worried about overt and covert censorship, due to “war on terror” security programs, concessions to authoritarian governments that might otherwise ban social media platforms from lucrative markets, and ideological purges. Conservatives and libertarians have good reasons to suspect content and user controls implemented for other reasons will devolve into political crusades against them. In its heyday, Twitter boasted of being an exciting frontier for freedom of speech, an invigorating arena of ideas where the course of history might be changed, 140 characters at a time. No one wants to hang around while it degenerates into the online equivalent of college campus dominated by snotty crybullies. Stunts like giving people the power to control drones with Tweets won’t restore the reputation for unbridled intellectual energy, constrained by nothing but that   message size limit, that made Twitter a big deal. The stock prices tumbling into oblivion, along with Milo’s   check mark, are sad evidence that Twitter is well on its way to becoming a little deal.

{"article": " It is sometimes argued that the media should spend less time on President Trump’s transgressive tweets in order to devote more attention to real issues, such as North Korea. In fact, it is necessary to focus on Trump’s tweets precisely because they shed light on the mind that is doing the deciding on North Korea. It is a distasteful exercise. But we cannot look away. We need to know the state of mind we’re dealing with. Trump’s tweets reveal a leader who is compulsive, abusive and easily triggered. Trump describes all this as “modern day presidential. ” Lincoln had his Gettysburg Address. Franklin Roosevelt had his Four Freedoms. But modern schoolchildren will learn the Mika bloody   tweet. What we are witnessing is not a new age in presidential communications. It is an ongoing public breakdown. And the question naturally arises: Is this the result of mental dysfunction? Most psychiatrists are (understandably) uncomfortable with diagnosing from a distance. And the particular diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder requires significant impairment  —   which is a hard case to make of a figure at the pinnacle of American politics. And yet. There are judgments that must be made about the fitness of leaders. Citizens are under no ethical obligation to be silent when they see serious dysfunction. The challenge here is not merely the trashing of political norms. The main problem is the possibility that America has an unbalanced president during a period of   global testing. This is not a clinical diagnosis. It is a civic and political judgment, made necessary by the president’s own words and acts. Trump holds a job that requires, above all else, the ability to unite and steady the nation in a time of crisis. There is no reason to believe he can play that role. Much of the prudence and courage required to confront this problem will need to come from Republicans and conservatives. Where to start? How about refusing to play down revolting lunacy? It is not merely an “occasional ad hominem” for a president to employ the tremendous power of his office to target individual American citizens who oppose him. It is an abuse of power.  It is not merely “uncouth” for a president to tolerate, even to hint support for, violence against political opponents (“I’d like to punch him in the face”). It creates an atmosphere of intimidation. It is not merely “exaggeration” for a president to issue a series of   lies, including that his predecessor spied on him and that a   victory was denied to him by widespread electoral fraud. It indicates either a deep cynicism or a tenuous connection to reality. It is not being “coarse” for a president to engage in consistent misogyny. It is a sign of a disturbing and   dehumanization of women.  Many conservatives would respond to this critique by saying, “At least he fights!” The question is: For what? Trump evinces no strong or consistent policy views. He fights for himself  —   for admiration and adulation  —   which is the only cause his extreme narcissism allows. Many conservatives would also respond by saying, “At least he does conservative things!” But if health care is any indication, Trump lacks conviction, knowledge and the ability to persuade. Other than that, he is Ronald Reagan incarnate. Trump’s conservative defenders are attempting something extraordinary: to politically normalize abnormal psychology. Their sycophancy enables a sickness. What next? Applying the 25th Amendment (containing the procedure to remove an unfit president from office) is a practical impossibility, since it involves the Cabinet turning against the president. But House and Senate Republicans should be prepared to aggressively challenge unbalanced or unhinged presidential language and decisions, rather than trying to dismiss them as simply a “distraction. ” And responsible officials in the executive branch  —   particularly at the State, Defense and Justice departments and in the various intelligence services  —   may also need to provide an internal check on foolish, precipitous orders. The option here is to refuse, to defy, to resign (or be fired) and then to publicly provide the reasons. No one really knows how to deal with this situation, which still feels more like an unnerving political novel than our political reality. Trump has led our country into unexplored territory. If this is “modern day presidential,” all progress moves toward the past.   Read more from Michael Gerson’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook .

{"article": "    Whenever folks in Penfield, New York get a hankering for pancakes for lunch  —   they head over to the 5 Mile Café. The   restaurant is known in those parts for serving breakfast any time of the day (order their homemade corned beef hash). Click here to join Todd’s American Dispatch: a   for conservatives! They are also known for their patriotism. “We are very patriotic here at the café  —   all year round  —  not just this time of year,” owner Jennifer Aquino told me. “We have American flags and patriotic things around the café. ” So Jennifer decided to ask the town for a permit so she could post a “God Bless America” banner on the front of her restaurant.  She wanted to display the banner from Memorial Day through Independence Day. There was just one significant problem. Penfield has a strict banner allotment policy. Businesses are only allowed to post banners for a total of three weeks out of the year. And Jennifer had used up her allotment. “At one point we had banners all over the town and the town just looked trashy and our residents said enough’s enough,” town supervisor Tony LaFountain told WHEC. Jennifer’s request was denied. Instead of posting the banner outside the restaurant, she posted it inside. And that was that  —   until the Orlando terrorist attack. Click here to get Todd’s   book  —   an indepth primer on how to restore traditional American values! “I decided on my way to work that I was going to put it up regardless of the town telling me I couldn’t,” she said. “So I put it up. ” A bit later that day she received an email from the town telling her to remove the banner. They warned her that she could face a possible fine for violating the ordinance. “I didn’t take it down,” Jennifer told me. “And I was willing to pay the fine. ” “The [message on the banner] means a lot to me  —   especially during this time in our country with all that’s going on with terrorism,” she said. “I just can’t believe that I can’t have this banner up and be supported by the town board. ” You would think most folks would appreciate the sentiment behind “God Bless America. ” Lord knows we need it. But rules are rules and the town board does not seem interested in accommodating Jennifer’s patriotic banner. “The fact that I’m being asked to take it down is wrong,” she said. “It’s against my First Amendment rights. People need to open up their eyes. If we start letting them tell us we can’t do this  —   it’s going to get worse. ” Lots of folks seem to agree with Jennifer’s sentiment. Hundreds and hundreds of supporters have posted messages on the café’s Facebook page and several customers have dropped off money  —   to help pay for any fines. Jennifer tells me she never imagined there would be a day like this in America. “I have lots of veterans in my family,” she said. “I have a cousin who fought in Desert Storm so that we could have the freedom to hang a banner that says, ‘God bless America. ’” And yet we live in a nation where you can be punished for simply being patriotic.

{"article": " Argentina’s social security agency, responsible for 43 percent of the federal government’s budget, expects the program’s deficit this year to exceed the 0. 4 percent of GDP in 2016, the executive director said in an interview on Tuesday. A higher deficit from the agency could complicate President Mauricio Macri’s plans to cut Argentina’s overall budget deficit without getting rid of social benefits in a congressional election year. ”The deficit will be bigger because we are reaching the limit of pension coverage. We have coverage of about 98 percent (of the population),” said Emilio Basavilbaso, director of the agency known as Anses. ”It is a clear sign that we did not come here to reduce social benefits.” Macri, who took office in December 2015 promising to end   populism, is trying to lower the fiscal deficit from 4. 6 percent of gross domestic product in 2016 to 4. 2 percent this year and 3. 2 percent in 2018. He seeks a better credit rating and more investment to fuel economic growth.  Basavilbaso said Congress could start to discuss a pension reform by the end of the year. He offered few details but said privatizing the pension system was not an option. ”There are other countries that have a manageable deficit, such as we have now, but if we do nothing, it would be irresponsible for the future,” Basavilbaso said. According to calculations from consulting firm Ecolatina, Anses’s pension fund increased its expenditures by 44 percent while its revenues grew by only 32 percent in 2016, when Argentina’s economy was emerging from recession. Anses received some 135 billion pesos ($8. 66 billion) from a tax amnesty that ended in March but by law can only use the funds to pay retirees and settle court cases with pensioners who claimed they were underpaid.  Anses’s investment fund totaled $55. 23 billion in 2016, growing 13. 5 percent from the previous year. Some opposition politicians have criticized the fund for buying government bonds. ”We are investing every peso in the fund, not spending,” Basavilbaso said. ”That is why we had a profit five times greater than in the previous government.”  (Writing by Caroline Stauffer; Editing by Cynthia Osterman) TOKYO Japan’s central bank will cut its inflation forecasts but hold off expanding stimulus this month, people familiar with the matter say, in another sign the bank is retreating from Governor Haruhiko Kuroda’s initial pledge to do whatever it takes to achieve his ambitious inflation target. TOKYO Japan’s labor shortage has pushed   to its highest since the global financial crisis, as companies scramble for workers with experience in the   economy.

{"article": " (CNN) FBI Director James Comey announced Tuesday that the bureau would not recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton for her handling of classified documents and sensitive information, which she conducted on a private email server during her time as secretary of state. The end of the FBI’s   investigation comes just weeks before the Democratic convention, during which Clinton is expected to become the party’s nominee for president.  But even as Comey said the FBI wouldn’t recommend charges    the final decision will be made by the Department of Justice    he also delivered a scathing verbal indictment of her behavior. Here are seven quotes from Comey on an issue that is sure to reverberate into the fall campaign: 1. ”Extremely careless” ”Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.” 2. ”Should have known” ”There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton’s position, or in the position of those with whom she was corresponding about those matters, should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation.” 3. ”Especially concerning” ”None of these emails should have been on any kind of unclassified system, but their presence is especially concerning because all of these emails were housed on unclassified personal servers not even supported by   security staff, like those found at agencies and departments of the United States government    or even with a commercial email service like Gmail.” 4. ”Still obligated to protect it” ”Only a very small number of the emails containing classified information bore markings indicating the presence of classified information. But even if information is not marked ’classified’ in an email, participants who know or should know that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect it.” 5. ”Generally lacking” While not the focus of our investigation, we also developed evidence that the security culture of the State Department in general, and with respect to use of unclassified email systems in particular, was generally lacking in the kind of care for classified information that is found elsewhere in the government. 6. ”Hostile actors” ”We do assess that hostile actors gained access to the private commercial email accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in regular contact from her personal account. We also assess that Secretary Clinton’s use of a personal email domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent.” 7. ”Sophisticated adversaries” ”She also used her personal email extensively while outside the United States, including sending and receiving   emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. Given that combination of factors, we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton’s personal email account.”", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> (CNN) FBI Director James Comey announced Tuesday that the bureau would not recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton for her handling of classified documents and sensitive information, which she conducted on a private email server during her time as secretary of state.

S. elections and any collusion with the Trump campaign. According to the Independent Journal Review: “I believe it hurts the country terribly because it shows we’re a divided,     country,” he said, according to CNN. “And we have very important things to do right now,” he added, citing trade deals, military issues, and the spread of nuclear weapons. “It also happens to be a pure excuse for the Democrats having lost an election that they should have easily won because of the Electoral College being slated so much in their way,” he said. “That’s all this is. I think it shows division, and it shows that we’re not together as a country. And I think it’s a very, very negative thing. ” Trump closed his comments by stating that “hopefully, this can go quickly, because we have to show unity if we’re going to do great things with respect to the rest of the world. ” This is the second time Trump has met with TV news anchors privately.

{"article": "A number of unanswered questions surround the medical treatment the late pop icon Prince received after his private plane made an emergency landing at Quad City International Airport in Moline, Illinois in the early morning hours of Friday, April 15. [Six days later the    Prince died at his residence in Chanhassen, Minnesota on Thursday, April 21.  Breitbart News can confirm that a private plane made an emergency landing at Quad City International Airport at 1:15 am April 15 and departed that same day at 11:30 am. “We did have an emergency landing at about 1:15 in the morning on the April 15th,” Jeff Patterson, Public Safety Manager at Quad City International Airport, tells Breitbart News. “It was a call for an unresponsive person. Our officers met the plane, and called for the Moline Fire Department, which transported the person to a local hospital,” Patterson says. “I can confirm it was Trinity Hospital,” he adds. “The plane left Quad City International Airport at approximately 11:30 am on April 15,” Patterson notes. But a spokesperson for UnityPoint Health  —   Trinity Hospital in Moline would not confirm that Prince was ever treated there. “We had no patient by that name in our directory. There is a registration process for any patient who is admitted,” a spokesperson for UnityPoint Health   Hospital tells Breitbart News. That carefully parsed, HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) compliant answer, however, is a marked contrast to the unequivocal denial that Prince had ever been a patient Breitbart News received from Genesis Medical Center in nearby Silvis, Illinois, the only other hospital in the metropolitan Moline area. Breitbart News pressed UnityPoint   Hospital for more details after confirming sources identified it as the hospital to which Prince was taken on April 15. “As you know federal privacy laws prohibit all hospitals from sharing information about any individual without their written approval. Confidentiality is important as health care and medical treatment is personal and private,” the spokesperson responded. “Federal privacy laws cover an individual 50 years past one’s death,” the spokesperson added. A number of questions remain concerning the medical treatment of Prince during the 10 hours and 15 minutes his private plane was on the ground at Quad City International Airport in Moline, Illinois on April 15. On the day of the incident, TMZ reported: 3:30 PM PST  —   A rep for Prince tells TMZ, the singer has been fighting the flu for several weeks. He canceled 2 shows on April 7th but wanted to make Thursday night’s performance in Atlanta, even though he was still not feeling well. After the show, he got on a plane and felt considerably worse, so his plane made an emergency landing in Moline, Illinois, where he was taken to the hospital and treated. He was released 3 hours later, got back on the plane and is now back home. Prince was rushed to a hospital early Friday morning after his jet made an emergency landing in Illinois   …     TMZ has learned. According to our sources, Prince’s private plane made an unscheduled landing at Quad City International Airport in Moline just after 1 AM. The singer was immediately transported by ambulance to a nearby hospital. A source close to the    singer tells us he’s been released and is doing okay. The nature of the medical emergency is unclear. The Rock and Roll Hall of Famer had performed Thursday night in Atlanta   …     and he was in the air for only a short time before things went south. On Thursday, after news of his death earlier in the day had been made public, TMZ provided more details: Multiple sources in Moline tell us, Prince was rushed to a hospital and doctors gave him a “save shot”   …     typically administered to counteract the effects of an opiate. Our sources further say doctors advised Prince to stay in the hospital for 24 hours. His people demanded a private room, and when they were told that wasn’t possible   …     Prince and co. decided to bail. The singer was released 3 hours after arriving and flew home. We’re told when Prince left he “was not doing well. ” We know authorities in Minnesota are trying to get the hospital records from Moline to help determine cause of death. That same day Mother Jones reported that “Naloxone, the   injectable ‘miracle drug’ used in hospitals for decades, more accessible for use outside the hospital. Naloxone can save a user’s life by reversing the effects of opiates. ” The reporting on Prince’s emergency landing in Moline, Illinois on April 15 leads to a number of unanswered questions, made even more significant in light of his death six days later: 1. Are reports that Prince left the care of the hospital in Moline on April 15 due to not being provided a private room true? 2. Was the drug Naloxone or a similar “save shot” administered to Prince while under the care of first responders or a hospital in Moline on April 15? 3. Why was Prince released from the Moline hospital so quickly, after being transported there when it was determined he was “unresponsive” just a few hours earlier at the time his private plane landed in the Quad Cities Airport in Moline on April 15? Breitbart News has also requested confirmation from the City of Moline’s Freedom of Information Act Office, which is handling all inquiries regarding the activities of the Moline Fire Department on April 15. In that FOIA request, we asked the City of Moline to confirm the time of day the Moline Fire Department transported Prince, or the unresponsive person, from the Quad Cities Airport to Trinity Hospital, as well as the time at which he departed the airport and the time he arrived at Trinity Hospital. FOIA officer Susannah Medina told Breitbart News she would try to respond to our request within five days.", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> A number of unanswered questions surround the medical treatment the late <span class=\"technique9\" id=\"row0annotation1\" technique9=\"0.35\"> pop icon </span><sup class=\"technique9\" id=\"row0annotation1\">9</sup> Prince received after his private plane made an emergency landing at Quad City International Airport in Moline, Illinois in the early morning hours of Friday, April 15.

{"article": "Jaipur, India (CNN) With just three words, Farha, a   old woman from the northern Indian city of Jaipur, became a single mother of three young children.  Farha’s husband instantly divorced her last year by saying ”talaq, talaq, talaq” in a fit of anger after their    daughter had asked him for five rupees (seven cents) to buy some firecrackers for a holiday celebration. Triple talaq, as it is commonly called, is an ancient and controversial Islamic practice where a man divorces a woman by saying the word talaq, the Arabic word for divorce, three times. Sometimes, it’s even delivered by phone or text message.  In theory, it should take three months to take effect. In practice, it is often instantaneous    the woman forced out of the house with barely a moment’s notice.  India, home to the second largest Muslim population in the world, is among the few that do not ban the practice. Other countries with majority Muslim populations like Pakistan and Indonesia have outlawed the practice for years.  Will it be banned? Yet this could soon change    a move that would be a victory for Farha and others like her.  The nation’s highest legal advisory body, the Law Commission of India, put out a survey to Indian citizens in October 2016, asking about various ways to reform family laws and specifically whether or not to ban talaq.  India’s Supreme Court plans to constitute a   bench to rule on the issue of whether talaq and other practices are un constitutional. It has asked all of the involved parties to submit their evidence in support of their petitions by March 30.  ”In a Muslim society which practices talaq, women have no existence,” says Farha, who adheres to the local custom of only using one name. ”A man can leave a woman at any time because of any issue.” Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA)    a network of Muslim women activists and organizations that operate in 15 states in the country     is leading a nationwide campaign against talaq. Its headquarters in Jaipur    known to tourists as India’s Pink City     is located in a dilapidated building in one of the city’s back alleys, which stand in sharp contrast to the decorated rose sandstone for which the city is a famed. It’s a one room office, barely six feet wide. Plastic chairs line both sides of the room. It is here that Farha came to seek help. They have long worked with women like Farha who have been abandoned by their husbands, by helping them file cases with the police or by providing basic necessities.  They aren’t advocating the complete erasure of the practice from Islam, but argue that because of the way talaq has been practiced, women need some form of legal recourse when they currently have none. ’Monstrosity’ In the last few years, the campaign has picked up momentum.  In 2016, a judge in a   court called the practice a ”monstrosity,” going on to say that triple talaq ”is a cruel and most demeaning form of divorce.” India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi also spoke out against the practice saying India cannot allow the lives of Muslim women to be ruined by three words said on the phone.  Now, the BMMA is awaiting the decision of India’s Supreme Court on its petition. The group’s   Zakia Soman and Noorjehan, who uses only one name, are hopeful of a ban against the practice which they call ” .”  According to the Quran, a man must consider the decision for a period of four months after he initially declares talaq, Soman explains. It is only at the end of this period can the divorce be finalized. Islamic law also provides for the presence of an arbitrator if there are problems during the process.  But Soman herself knows that reality often is quite different from theory. Her husband left her immediately after saying the words one day almost 15 years ago. Pushback, Not everyone, however, is in favor of banning triple talaq.  India’s diverse communities of multiple faiths each have their own laws for marriage, divorce and inheritance  —   matters deemed ”personal law.” Various politicians have proposed an overarching secular law called the Uniform Civil Code which would replace religious laws.  For some Muslim religious leaders, the fact that India’s current government  —   led by a Hindu nationalist party  —   is in favor of a Uniform Civil Code is a source of concern. ”It is our fundamental given in the constitution, right to abide by our personal laws, you cannot snatch our right from us,” said Mohammad Jafar, a life member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, the legal organization opposing BMMA’s petition filed in the Supreme Court. Jafar recognizes that it is a problem when some men give divorce instantaneously. The solution, he says, is education for these men, as they have done something not permissible in Islam. ”As a Muslim, one has to follow the rules of marriage and separation according to the Quran and Sunnah, the teachings of Mohammad, so we have to abide by it, and this right has been given in the Constitution, so why do they want to change it?” he said. Still fighting, Soman and the BMMA, however, see the fight at hand as one for gender equality.  Farha, the single mother of three from Jaipur, now relies on the help of her parents to feed and support her children.  She stays in the upper floor of the same house that she lived in when she was married. Her husband lives below. A housewife for years, Farha, does not have a job. All she wants, she says, is for her children to be provided for. For women like Farha, there are few legal resources that she can rely on after a man abandons her. ”The problem here is not religion, it’s patriarchy masquerading as religion,” Soman said.

{"article": " Bernie Sanders did something previously unheard of in last night’s CNN debate: He stood up for Palestinians’ humanity.    ”As somebody who is 100 percent   in the long run,” Sanders said, ”we are going to have to treat the Palestinian people with respect and dignity.”  Related Read Clinton and Sanders’s remarkable exchange on    For many, this seems banal: Sanders is asserting that the US needs to understand Israeli and Palestinian beliefs to ultimately resolve the conflict. But in the context of a presidential primary, it’s historic. For years, mainstream candidates have hewed to a narrow ” ” line, blaming the conflict on the Palestinians and pledging strong support for Israeli policy. Democrats and Republicans have done this in different ways, to be sure, but generally speaking the Israeli perspective dominates.    Yet last night, the most successful Jewish candidate in primary history flipped the script. He inserted a line of argument, long common on the Israeli left, into the American political mainstream.    The ensuing argument he had with Clinton is the conversation Democrats (and perhaps America) have needed on Israel for years. The   exchange is an internal liberal argument going public            Sanders, as his comments make clear, is not taking a     position. He emphasized his support for Israel, and his time as a young man living in the Jewish state.    Rather, Sanders is championing what’s commonly called liberal Zionism, which holds (among other things) that you can both support the existence of Israel and be deeply critical of its treatment of the Palestinians at the same time. ”Of course Israel has a right to defend itself, but long term there will never be peace in that region unless the United States [recognizes] the serious problems that exist among the Palestinian people,” Sanders said during the debate. Clinton’s response, where she highlights her time as secretary of state, is extremely telling. She says that she, too, has stood up for Palestinians  —   but in private negotiations:     I’m the person who held the last three meetings between the president of the Palestinian Authority and the prime minister of Israel. There were only four of us in the room, [Prime Minister] Netanyahu, [President] Abbas, George Mitchell, and me. Three long meetings. And I was absolutely focused on what was fair and right for the Palestinians.  This has, for years, been the standard line among mainstream   Democrats. Criticize Israeli mistakes, to be sure, but do it in private. Public distance between the United States and Israel erodes trust between the two sides, which makes it hard for the US to broker peace negotiations. Many liberal Zionists, like Sanders, find this unsatisfying. They argue that Israel is headed on a   course, expanding settlements in the West Bank and choking off the possibility for a   solution. Backroom arguments aren’t good enough anymore; the US needs to warn Israel away from its current path. This is the meaning of Bernie’s sharpest dig in the debate: ”There comes a time when if we pursue justice and peace, we are going to have to say that Netanyahu is not right all of the time.” Sanders is saying that the US needs to publicly acknowledge Israeli mistreatment of the Palestinians, because the reality is that Palestinians are indeed suffering terribly  —   and   Israeli policies, championed by politicians like Netanyahu, are partly to blame. Clinton, he argues, has at various points (such as her recent speech to AIPAC, the   lobby) been too unwilling to emphasize. If Sanders gets his way, this would be a serious revision to the standard Democratic approach to the   conflict. We’ve started to see it under Obama  —   Obama has been publicly critical of Netanyahu on both settlement expansion and his attempts to obstruct the Iran deal. But Sanders wants to extend this criticism, arguing that the United States should take a more active role in championing Palestinian rights.    This isn’t an argument over whether the United States should continue to treat Israel as an ally and friend. It’s a question of how critical America should be of its ally over its treatment of the Palestinians  —   one that has long divided American liberals and Jews but is only starting to creep into mainstream Democratic discourse. Sanders busted a big taboo  —   and heralded a new Democratic discourse on Israel            Sanders is far from a perfect champion for the liberal Zionist position. Just hours before the debate, he suspended his Jewish outreach coordinator, Simone Zimmerman, for being overly harsh in her criticism of Netanyahu (disclosure: Zimmerman is a personal friend). But Sanders’s debate advocacy matters nonetheless. His unapologetically liberal Zionism is sending a signal to Democrats that it’s okay to be more critical of Israel. He’s a Jew who used to live in Israel; in recent polls, roughly half of all Democrats nationally have said they want him to be the party’s presidential nominee. It’s hard to overemphasize how taboo busting Sanders’s advocacy of Palestinian rights is. ”Bernie is opening a lot of space for a generation of Democratic politicians, and maybe for Clinton, re Israel,” BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith tweeted last night. And he’s right. Now, if Sanders didn’t speak for a large contingent on the American left, his positions wouldn’t matter. But opinion polls, and deeper structural trends in American politics, suggest that he does. Look, for instance, at a February Gallup poll on  . That poll found that a majority of Democrats, like virtually all American demographics, sympathize with Israel over the Palestinians.    But it also found that a majority of Democrats favor creating a Palestinian state: ”58% of Democrats supporting the establishment of a Palestinian state, compared with 26% of Republicans,” Gallup’s Lydia Saad reports. So while Democrats are quite sympathetic to Israel, they also believe Palestinians deserve a state of their own  —   unlike Republicans, who tend to sympathize with Israel in much larger numbers and be skeptical of Palestinian statehood. Sanders’s liberal Zionism, then, is no longer obviously a losing position for Democratic politicians to take. This view could only to strengthen over time. Republicans are taking an increasingly   view of being   owing largely to evangelical and neoconservative influences inside the party. Meanwhile, increasingly important Democratic constituencies  —   younger voters, black voters, Latino voters  —   all support Israel at lower rates than do other American demographic groups. And these demographic  groups are becoming an increasingly important constituency in the Democratic primary. Republican politicians will have growing political incentives to attack Democrats as insufficiently supportive of Israel. It’ll play well to both their base and the median voter. That threatens to code support for Israel, once a bipartisan issue, as a Republican one. The more it coded as partisan, the more comfortable Democratic politicians will become in criticizing Israel. Sanders’ view of Israel, then, is likely to become more mainstream, not less. His performance last night is the beginning of a long process of mainstreaming a more critical view of Israel in the Democratic Party. More traditional Democrats like Clinton are probably going to need to start learning how to deal with it.

{"article": "2015’s Baahubali: The Beginning, the impressive first chunk of India’s most expensive film yet, built towards a literal cliffhanger, with a strongman knifed in the back by a trusted associate on the mountain it had taken just shy of three hours to climb. Not untypical of a film hungrily synthesising centuries’ worth of sacred and secular myths, that shock was always going to be tricky to top  —   so it’s a relief to report that The Conclusion opens with a no less jawdropping   between thehero’s mother and a stampeding elephant. Here, once again, is thunderous spectacle unlikely to be surpassed in several summers, and clinching proof of   SS Rajamouli’s position among world cinema’s boldest imagemakers. With quite some explaining to do, The Conclusion’s first half rewinds back into this narrative, dispatching the Herculean Baahu (Prabhas, BeeGeean head of hair  ) to an idyllic neighbouring kingdom for a lesson or two in worldliness. If the first film inclined towards physicality  —   how to get up that mountainside?  —   this second initially steps sideways into more philosophical terrain. The courtly triangleestablished between Baahu, warrior princess Devasena (Anushka Shetty) and   swordsman Kumar Varma (Subba Raju) prompts a few questions about those qualities we look for in our leaders sociologists get some substance to chew between handfuls of popcorn. The action throughout remains joyous. Baahu’s   strength permits the film to take mightily imaginative leaps: one minute our guy’s casually surfing flaming oxen, the next he’s converting himself into a human cannonball with the assistance of a coconut tree. This time, however, we’re more aware of the stakes underpinning such flights of fancy. Rajamouli plots a nimble, broadly progressive path through an especially tangled set of court politics  —   setting Baahu and Deva tododge iron fists and wandering hands alike  —   while alighting upon pleasing grace notes and symmetries: the coda offers a rare convincing demonstration of trickledown economics, even as it returns us to The Beginning. Entirely absent, again, is any cynicism: it’s amazing that a blockbuster with a long   rollcall of “brand partners” should then be permitted to tell a story that could have been filmed in 1917, or 917, if they’d had equipment for a Baahu to lug. This production’s triumph is the room it’s granted Rajamouli to head into the fields and dream up endlessly expressive ways to frame bodies in motion. Of the many sequences here primed to cut through jadedness, perhaps the most wondrous is that which finds Baahu guiding Deva   to shoot three arrows simultaneously  —   a set piece that speaks both to a love of action, and love in action. The budget’s big, the muscle considerable, but they’re nothing compared with Baahubali’s heart.", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> 2015’s Baahubali: The Beginning, the impressive first chunk of India’s most expensive film yet, built towards <span class=\"technique8\" id=\"row0annotation1\" technique8=\"0.77\"> a literal cliffhanger, </span><sup class=\"technique8\" id=\"row0annotation1\">8</sup> with a strongman knifed in the back by a trusted associate on the mountain it had taken just shy of three hours to climb.

{"article": "With an attack on a Syrian air base, the United States has now bombed the two main players in Syrian war  —   President Bashar Assad’s military and the Islamic State. This raises a fundamental question about U. S. aims in the Syrian war: If the two most powerful groups in Syria are both unacceptable, what outcome is the U. S. seeking? Both Barack Obama and President Trump have sought to limit U. S. involvement in Syria for their own reasons. Yet both have been sucked in and struggled to clearly define their objectives in the messy, complicated war. Michael O’Hanlon of the Brookings Institution said he supported the strikes. But, he added, ”There is no obvious military step that could follow. What is needed is a political strategy for Syria that squares this circle. Assad must go, yet he will likely stay. That is a paradox that requires creative thinking.” Here’s a look at several key questions surrounding U. S. policy: What is the U. S. goal? Obama wanted to shrink the U. S. military footprint in Middle East, and resisted pressure to take military action in the wake of Syria’s 2011 uprising. He never ordered an attack against the Syrian government, but Obama did launch the bombing campaign against the Islamic State as it rapidly expanded in 2014. His aim was to defeat ISIS on the battlefield and seek a negotiated political deal with Assad. Obama’s air war made progress against ISIS, but peace efforts with Assad went nowhere. Until this week, Trump’s stated goal was to ramp up Obama’s bombing campaign against ISIS, while accepting the reality of Assad as Syria’s leader. But after Tuesday’s apparent chemical weapons attack, Trump said Wednesday, ”My attitude toward Syria and Assad has changed very much.” Trump hasn’t defined the outcome he seeks. But Secretary of State Rex Tillerson now says Assad should have ”no role” in governing Syria  —   a reversal from the administration position just days earlier. Are more U. S. strikes against Assad likely? Many analysts see the U. S. strike, which included 59 Tomahawk missiles fired from two U. S. warships in the eastern Mediterranean, as a   response. ”The first thing I thought of was, ’Wow, just like [President] Bill Clinton used to lob cruise missiles at [Iraqi leader] Saddam Hussein in the 1990s,” Robert Ford, the former U. S. ambassador to Syria, told NPR. ”And Saddam Hussein never changed, and things just went on as they were.” By most assessments, Assad is in his strongest position in several years, though his country keeps spiraling downward in an unending humanitarian crisis. With help from Russia and Iran, Assad’s army has retaken the major cities in the heavily populated western part of the country, while the Islamic State remains on the defensive due to the U. S. bombing campaign in the eastern part. What does this mean for relations with Russia? U. S.  relations just became even more troubled. Russia is heavily invested in Syria, its only real ally in the Arab world, and it condemned the U. S. military action. Dmitri Peskov, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, said Friday the U. S. strike ”deals a significant blow to relations between Russia and America, which are already in a poor state,” according to the news agency RIA. One of the few shared U. S.  aims is the fight against terrorism, and Peskov said the American action ”creates a serious obstacle for building an international coalition to fight it and to effectively resist this universal evil.” Tillerson heads to Moscow next week, and the Syrian conflict could supersede the swirling controversy over Russian meddling in last year’s U. S. presidential election. What’s the state of battle against the Islamic State? The U. S. bombing campaign, backed by close to 1, 000 U. S. forces on the ground and allied local fighters, has been edging closer to the ISIS headquarters in Raqqa. The U. S. and its local partners are about 20 miles from the town in   Syria, along the Euphrates River. But the Pentagon has warned that it could be a long, hard fight. Even if ISIS is driven out of Raqqa and a few smaller towns it controls, who would take over? The U. S. doesn’t want to occupy it, and the American partners are relatively small factions that aren’t well positioned to run the place. For example, the main U. S. ally in the region is a Kurdish faction, while Raqqa is a mostly Sunni Arab city. What’s happened to the other rebel groups supported by the U. S.? These moderate opposition groups were prominent in the early days of the uprising. But as the war intensified, they lost ground to the Syrian military and radical Islamist groups. The CIA and the U. S. military have tried to boost the moderate rebels, with no success. The U. S.  rebels are now bit players. They are involved in talks outside of Syria, and are still working with U. S. officials. But right now, they aren’t significant actors in the war and don’t have a realistic chance of taking on a major political role. In this environment, Assad argues he’s the only plausible option to lead the country. Otherwise, he claims, Syria would be overtaken by a terrorist group like ISIS. What are the prospects for ending the Syrian war? Periodic   talks in Kazakhstan have failed to stop the bloodletting. Political negotiations in Geneva have also proved futile, getting bogged down on the question of Assad’s future role. Spoiler alert: Assad says he must stay opponents say he must go. If the U. S. and its allies drive ISIS out of Raqqa and other cities, that could alter the trajectory of the war, but such a blow is likely months away at minimum, according to analysts. And if the U. S. strike against Assad’s military was just a   event, the impact will probably be limited. ”This isn’t a big blow for Assad and his forces,” said Ford, the former ambassador. ”He is still, little by little, advancing in the Syrian civil war. He is still, little by little, winning.” Greg Myre is a national security correspondent.

{"article": "What is the panic button exactly? Really, I want to know what it is and then I want to know its value. There has been much discussion of whether the Yankees need to press such a thing. To what end? Now is not time for panic or  —   worse  —   the kind of maneuvers panic evokes. The Yankees need to accept who they are, and if they are a bad team  —   the early indicators are that is their identity  —   so be it. The big mistake would be trying to fix something with a Raul Mondesi or Vernon Wells. The Yankees have been contenders for 23 straight years. That is never happening again, unless this club rights itself and makes it 24. Many executives around the game have predicted the     season for the Yankees in recent years, and then have been stunned when it did not occur.  Judgment day finally may be upon this franchise. The   record reflects a team that has just two elite performers  —   Andrew Miller and Dellin Betances (yes, I still consider Betances elite despite the recent hiccups)  —   and both are symbiotic players: They need others to excel to make their jobs meaningful. Adding Aroldis Chapman in a week merely will give the Yankees three   guitarists in a band with no drummers or bass players or songwriters. After missing the playoffs in 2013, the Yankees abandoned their   strategy to get under the $189 million luxury tax threshold and invested nearly a half a billion in Masahiro Tanaka, Jacoby Ellsbury, Brian McCann and Carlos Beltran. In   the Yankees were not very good, but refused to accept who they were and pushed to 85 and 84 wins and pseudo contention, failing to seize opportunities to trade Robinson Cano and David Robertson. In that   window, they refused to accept whom they had become and missed the chances to accelerate a rebuild. I admire the general spirit of what they do. In an age when so many teams are tanking, the Yankees are trying to retain a George Steinbrenner mandate of winning year to year. But Steinbrenner operated in an era when perhaps his team alone, or maybe one or two others, could sign big free agents. But Zack Greinke really signed with the Diamondbacks, Max Scherzer with the Nationals. More clubs can and do play in this forum. The structure of how much can be spent in the draft and internationally further scuttles advantages long held by the Yankees. Once more, no team is putting together 23 straight winning seasons again  —   not under these rules. It is hard to win and keep winning. We thought the Astros had decoded the    strategy. Yet after beating the Yankees in the   game last year, they have a worse record than the Yankees this season. The Dodgers, with all their money spent, have not been to a World Series since 1988 and are . 500 now. The Yankees can look to the Red Sox for some inspiration. They won it all in 2013 and have finished in last place each of the past two seasons. But 2015 was not a waste. The Red Sox used the season to stick with or learn about Xander Bogaerts, Jackie Bradley Jr. and Travis Shaw, all of whom contributed   to sweeping the Yanks at Fenway over the weekend and jumping Boston to first place. The Yankees also should look to their own history. They began the 2005 campaign at  . Steinbrenner empowered Brian Cashman to do what he felt was correct, and the GM decided against following the organization’s   DNA. He resolved to protect the best players in a thin system (namely Phil Hughes). Robinson Cano and   Wang were promoted along with a journeyman named Aaron Small. All paid big dividends, as did a minor trade for Shawn Chacon. Those Yankees actually won 95 games. This group would be   to duplicate that result, but the philosophy should be the same. Try to figure this out internally. Don’t take on more veterans and their contracts as window dressing. If the team is finally terrible, then use July to make the best   deals for Chapman and Miller, and if there is a market for     Carlos Beltran and Mark Teixeira (though I suspect he would not waive his   clause) deal them, too. See if Rob Refsnyder can play third (did you think Travis Shaw could do so at this time last year?) and give Gary Sanchez half the catching responsibility. Now is no time for panic for the Yankees. There is going to be opportunity, even under the   scenario of being   for the first time in a quarter of a century. The Yankees have to be prepared to accept being bad in attempts to be real good again.", "sentence": {"content": "<div class=\"technique\" id=\"row0\"> What is the panic button exactly? <span class=\"technique4\" id=\"row0annotation1\" technique4=\"0.47\"> Really, I want to know what it is and then I want to know its value. </span><sup class=\"technique4\" id=\"row0annotation1\">4</sup> There has been much discussion of whether the Yankees need to press such a thing.

Asked why he wants to serve in Congress, Gianforte told CNN that he would be a ”strong voice for Montana in DC.” He also talked about raising four kids in Montana.  In this race, Gianforte has raised about $2. 3 million, compared with his Democratic opponent, Rob Quist, with $3. 3 million, Federal Election Commission records show. Gianforte also lent his campaign $1 million. Trump backs candidate, The Trump administration has lent plenty of support to Gianforte. Vice President Mike Pence and Donald Trump Jr. both have campaigned for him, and the President just recorded a robocall in a push to turn out GOP voters. ”Hi, this is President Donald Trump, and I know what the people of Montana really want and really care about,” he says in the recorded call. ”If you don’t vote . .. the liberal Democrats running for Congress will decimate and dismantle all that we’ve done. . .. So get to the polls and vote for Greg. . .. You’ll be very proud of him for years to come.” Montana is Trump country, having voted 57% to 36% for him over Hillary Clinton in the November election.

Gianforte allegedly body slammed Ben Jacobs, a reporter for The Guardian, and broke his glasses, according to an audio recording of the event and eyewitness accounts. ”He took me to the ground,” Jacobs said. But Gianforte’s campaign said Jacobs acted aggressively toward the candidate, shoved a recorder into his face, grabbed him by the wrist and pulled them both to the ground. Gianforte received a citation and is scheduled to appear in Gallatin County Justice Court before June 7, the sheriff’s office said.

{"article": " (CNN) An Iraqi man watching his first snowfall in his new American hometown was shot and killed by an unknown assailant, according to Dallas police. Authorities have stepped up patrols in the neighborhood where Ahmed   lived    and died    in their effort to find out who killed the    early Thursday, as he and his brother stood in the parking lot of his apartment complex watching the snow.  ’s wife was with them taking photos.  Dallas police spokesman Jeff Cotner said   who recently immigrated to the U. S. had never seen snow and ”just like all of us, a pretty snowfall brings the child out in us.”  There is ”extreme heartache . .. and no shortage of sadness for this beautiful young man who had just come to this country 20 days ago,” said Alia Salem, executive director of the Council on   Relations in the Dallas and Fort Worth area. CAIR became involved in the case immediately after the shooting, according to Salem, because of ”a heightened sense of awareness with regard to hate crimes against Muslims.”  Salem said the Muslim community wanted to know whether the shooting death was random or whether    was targeted. Police say they have no indication so far that it was a hate crime. When shooting broke out,   cried ”I’m hit!” according to Cotner, basing that on statements from witnesses and the victim’s relatives. He ran to his apartment nearby and died a few hours later. Police did not say where   was struck or how many times he was shot.  Some residents reported seeing two to four men enter the apartment complex on foot through a vehicle gate before the shooting, according to Cotner. He said there was no interaction between the men and   and his family. In    soundless surveillance video, one person who appears to be carrying a rifle is seen running just ahead of a second person, Dallas police Officer Monica Cordova said. The second person is shown walking at a slower pace, holding what appears to be a handgun in his right hand. Approximately 13 seconds later, another person comes into view and passes by the camera, followed by a fourth individual who is walking, she said.  From the vantage point of the camera, it is difficult to make out any of the features of the suspects or even the gender, although police have said they are looking for four black males.  Witnesses say multiple shots were fired from what is believed to be a rifle. Cotner said police are conducting tests to find out whether more than one rifle was used in the shooting, but he said he could not reveal the make or model of the weapon.   Cotner said Friday that other than that, police have little to go on. ”We can’t solve this crime alone,” he said. Authorities are appealing to the public to contact them with any information that might help the investigation. North Texas Crime Stoppers is offering a $5, 000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and an indictment, police said.  Salem is encouraging anyone with information about the shooting to share it.  She said there are online campaigns underway to help raise funds for the family’s expenses, as well as an effort to raise additional funds to contribute to the reward.

{"article": "POINT JUDITH, R. I.  —   There was a time when whiting were plentiful in the waters of Rhode Island Sound, and Christopher Brown pulled the fish into his long stern trawler by the bucketful. “We used to come right here and catch two, three, four thousand pounds a day, sometimes 10,” he said, sitting at the wheel of the Proud Mary  —   a   named, he said, after his wife, not the Creedence Clearwater Revival song  —   as it cruised out to sea. But like many other fish on the Atlantic Coast, whiting have moved north, seeking cooler waters as ocean temperatures have risen, and they are now filling the nets of fishermen farther up the coast. Studies have found that   of marine species in the Northeast United States have shifted or extended their range as a result of ocean warming, migrating northward or outward into deeper and cooler water. Lobster, once a staple in southern New England, have decamped to Maine. Black sea bass, scup, yellowtail flounder, mackerel, herring and monkfish, to name just a few species, have all moved to accommodate changing temperatures. Yet fishing regulations, which among other things set legal catch limits for fishermen and are often based on where fish have been most abundant in the past, have failed to keep up with these geographical changes. The center of the black sea bass population, for example, is now in New Jersey, hundreds of miles north of where it was in the 1990s, providing the basis for regulators to distribute shares of the catch to the Atlantic states. Under those rules, North Carolina still has rights to the largest share. The result is a convoluted workaround many fishermen view as nonsensical. Because black sea bass are now harder to find in their state waters, North Carolina fishermen must steam north 10 hours, to where the fish are abundant, to even approach the state’s allocation. Mr. Brown and other New England fishermen, however, whose states have much smaller shares, can legally land only a small fraction of the black sea bass they catch and must throw the rest overboard. And New England states like Maine, where fishermen are beginning to catch black sea bass regularly, have only a tiny allocation and no established fishery. “Our management system assumes that the ocean has white lines drawn on it, but fish don’t see those lines,” said Malin L. Pinsky, an assistant professor in the department of ecology, evolution and natural resources at Rutgers University, who studies how marine species adapt to climate change. “And our management system is not as nimble as the fish. ” The mismatch between the location of fish and the rules for catching them has pitted recreational fishermen against commercial ones and state against state. It has heightened tensions among fishermen, government regulators and the scientists who advise them and raised questions for fishery managers that have no easy answers. Reflecting these tensions, Senators Richard Blumenthal and Christopher S. Murphy, both Democrats of Connecticut, noted in a letter to the acting inspector general of the Commerce Department in June that fishermen in their state were experiencing “extreme financial hardship” because the apportionment of resources was so outdated. “We request that your office investigate how the current system impacts the region’s fishermen and whether the structure should be reformed to bring quota allocations in line with current data on actual fish population distribution,” the senators, joined by Representative Joe Courtney, also a Democrat of Connecticut, wrote. “As species of fish move north, the allocation levels should migrate with them. ” Although such shifts in allocations are possible, said Tom Nies, the executive director of the New England Fishery Management Council, in practice they are difficult to execute. “If you’re giving fish to somebody, you’re taking them away from somebody else,” Mr. Nies said. But, he added, fishery managers at state and federal levels are examining ways to take into account the effects of warming ocean temperatures. Those approaches include changes in how permits are structured and giving states with nascent fisheries representation in councils that oversee states where the fish are  . “I would be surprised if you find very many fishermen who will tell you that climate change is not happening,” he said. “I think there’s a clear recognition from everybody that this is a problem, and a lot of people are working on how to address it. ” One approach being actively pursued by scientists and managers is developing methods to incorporate temperature data and other characteristics of the environment into the surveys that regulators use to set fishing quotas. Richard J. Seagraves, the senior scientist for the   Fishery Management Council, said that in a series of surveys distributed and town   meetings held by the council, “the most pressing concern expressed by all parties was the failure to address ecosystem considerations, like a changing climate and the physical effects on fish stocks. ” The government periodically monitors fish species to see if they are thriving or at risk of extinction. The surveys are intended to determine how much fishing a given species can sustain, in order to avoid overfishing. But even in the best case, trying to estimate the size of fish populations is an uncertain proposition. And the migration of species in response to warming temperatures has made the task considerably harder. “From a scientific perspective, there are some really interesting questions,” Dr. Pinsky said. “Where did the fish go? Did we eat them? Or did they go somewhere else? Those are questions we haven’t really had to grapple with. ” A 2014 survey of butterfish  —   a small, silvery fish that provides food for many larger fish species and is popular in Japan  —   illustrated the problem with traditional assessment methods. A previous survey of butterfish had been unsuccessful at figuring out how robust the population was  —   there was too much uncertainty in the assessment’s sampling of the fish. Because regulators could not make a judgment about the status of the species, butterfish fishing was temporarily suspended. But when a team of scientists began talking to fishermen, they realized that the earlier survey had not taken into account the movements of the butterfish in response to changes in water temperature. “What we learned from working with the fishermen was that the animals were probably occurring outside the survey,” John A. Manderson, a research biologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s northeast fisheries science center. Dr. Manderson and his colleagues developed a way to factor movement patterns and temperature shifts into models for assessing the fish. Once their work was incorporated into the next survey, which found that butterfish were still plentiful, the fishery reopened. Dr. Manderson said that listening to fishermen, who are often in the best position to know how many fish there are and where they are, was the key to understanding what was occurring. “What started out as an academic exercise turned into a collaborative one,” Dr. Manderson said. Yet it remains difficult to tease apart how much of the dip in a fish population is a result of climate change and how much is a result of overfishing, or even of a natural fluctuation in population numbers from year to year. “I think you’ve got to be careful when you react to these things,” Mr. Nies, of the New England fishery council, said. “You want to make sure you’re reacting to a signal and not to noise. ” He noted that there had been cases where regulators incorrectly concluded that a species had collapsed, citing the haddock population in the  . “Here we are 20 years later and we’ve got more Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank haddock than has ever been detected in the last 100 years,” he said. A growing number of scientists and managers favor moving eventually to what they call   management, a system that is focused on the environmental niche a species occupies, rather than individual species themselves. Under such a system, regulation would be aimed at making sure that there are enough fish available to maintain an ecological balance of predators and prey, and quotas might be based on a category of marine species, rather than specific fish. The West Coast has already adopted some version of this approach in the north Pacific, setting an overall quota for groundfish caught in the Bering Sea. Temperature affects fish species differently. “Climate change is going to make it hard on some of those species that are not particularly fond of warm or warming waters,” said Mr. Brown, who is the president of the Rhode Island Commercial Fishermen’s Association, a trade group. “But as the impacts of climate change descend upon us, there are also species that are going to be victorious, hugely victorious. ” Yet the changes are happening so fast that regulators will have to adapt quickly if they are to have any hope of keeping up. Marine species, Dr. Manderson said, are moving north at 10 times the rate of animals on land. “Our ideas of property rights and laws are purely ” he said. “But the ocean is all about flux and turbulence and movement. ” He added, “Even the science is too slow. ”", "sentence": {"content": "<div> POINT JUDITH, R.

{"article": "In “My President Was Black,” The Atlantic’s   Coates examined Barack Obama’s tenure in office, and his legacy. The story was built, in part, around a series of conversations he had with the president. This is a transcript of the first of those three encounters, which took place on September 27, 2016. Valerie Jarrett, the senior adviser to the president, was also present. You can find responses to the story, and to these conversations, here. Barack Obama: All right, where do you want to start.   Coates: You know, I was thinking about something today that I heard, and I wanted to see if you could confirm it, and if you could, whether you could talk about it. I was told that the night of the inauguration it was a huge, huge party here. Is that correct? Obama: [Chuckles] That would be correct. Valerie Jarrett: The second inauguration   …     Obama: You’re talking about the second inauguration? Coates: Was it the second? Celebrities, maybe Stevie Wonder and Usher? Obama: First inauguration we had —  you know, this is a good example of when you first arrive, you don’t know what you’re supposed to do. So there are all these state balls that take place, and we sort of assumed —  we were told —  well, you should go to all the balls. So   …     Coates: Did you try that? Did you try to go to all of them? Obama: We went to all of them. And you do a dance at each one. Coates: Fifty? Obama: No, no, not every state has one, but we went to 10 or 12. And by the time we were done, it was like 1 o’clock, so we had Wynton Marsalis here playing, and people had been hanging out, but by the time we got back Michelle’s feet were all hurting and swollen up, and I was exhausted, and we hung out here probably for half an hour, and went to bed. Now, the second inauguration, we had it a little more figured out. So we did, like, three balls and then got back here and had a DJ and, yeah, Usher and Stevie. Coates: How late did you go? Obama:  ? Four o’clock? Coates: Was the second one more joyous for you —   Obama: Yes. Coates: It’s one thing you’re the first black president, but it’s like “Wow, this really —  ” Obama: Yeah. I think the way to think about it is the first inauguration is like your wedding in the sense that it is a joyous moment and occasion, but you’re so busy and kind of stressed making sure that Aunt    and Uncle    and cousins are getting tickets that it ends up going by without you even really knowing what’s happening. The second one you could savor. But partly, as you indicated, for political reasons as well. Because we had gone through four of the toughest years this country has gone through since the ’30s. And to be able to win a majority of the vote the second time indicated that we had worked with a broad cross section of the country and they trusted what we were trying to do. And it wasn’t just a singular   moment it was an affirmation that people thought we had done a good job. Coates: I think for those of us —  and I certainly threw myself in this camp —  I was telling Valerie the other day, the idea of a black president was a joke, in every black   comic routine everywhere —   Obama: Right. A friend of mine gave me Head of State —  remember [Chris Rock] and Bernie Mac? —  when we were still running. Said, “Man, you got to see Head of State. ” [Laughter] Coates: Yeah, this was like a  . But I think one of the things that did distinguish you was the ability to see it and to have the vision that, yes, this could happen, and then to have it again. I’m speaking specifically in terms of race   …     There were those of us who said, “It’s no way. ” And to see it the first and second time must have really reaffirmed a lot of what you thought. Obama: As I said, the second time, people had seen me work. They had seen me have victories, they had seen me have defeats, they had seen me make mistakes, they had seen me at some high moments but also some low moments. So they knew me, at that point, in the round. I wasn’t just a projection of whatever they hoped for. You know, we always cautioned each other, in the ’08 race, that people were projecting so much onto my campaign —  you know, that this would solve every racial problem, or that this indicated that we were beyond race, or that we were going to magically usher in a new era of progressive politics, and that we had vanquished all the   politics of the past. And for us to then be able to grind it out, to figure out how do we get out of this Great Recession, and what’s the process where we can finally get health care done even if it’s not pretty, and how do we deal with winding down two wars, and how do we clean up after an administration to reinvigorate things like the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department. People had seen all that, and then had to make a judgment: Do we want to continue on this course, and do we continue to have faith in this person? And so it is true that, for me at least, in some ways the first race was lightning in a bottle. I saw it, I envisioned the possibility of it, but everything converged in a way that you couldn’t duplicate. The second race as a consequence felt more solid, because it was harder. And you know we didn’t have tailwinds, we had a lot more headwinds. Coates: Yeah, I have my own theories about this, and I wonder what yours are. Why were you able to see it? Obama: The first time? Coates: Yeah. You said you were able to envision the possibility. Why? I mean, when you think about yourself —  because obviously, as you know, a lot of African Americans could not —  what’s the difference? Obama: Yeah. I’d say a couple things. The first was that I had been elected as the senator of Illinois, and Illinois is the most demographically representative state in the country. If you took all the percentages of black, white, Latino, rural, urban, agricultural, manufacturing —  [if] you took that cross section across the country, and you shrank it, it would be Illinois. So when I ran for the Senate I had to go into southern Illinois, downstate Illinois, farming communities —  some with very tough racial histories, some areas where there just were no African Americans of any number, and I had seen my ability to connect with those communities and those people against some pretty formidable opponents. When I ran for the Senate, I was one of seven candidates. One of them, Dan Hynes, was already the state comptroller, was the son of the former Senate president and chair of the Democratic Party, a   Irish family in the state, who got the endorsement, I think, of 100 out of 103 county chairs as well as the   endorsement. And you had a multimillionaire   manager who was spending huge amounts of money. And when we won that race, not just an African American from Chicago, but an African American with an exotic history and a name Barack Hussein Obama, could connect with and appeal to a much broader audience. And then, keep in mind, that the response of the 2004 convention speech was admittedly over the top, and so I had for two years seen the response I would get when we traveled all around the country. I had campaigned on behalf of other Democrats. Ben Nelson, one of the most conservative Democrats in the Senate, from Nebraska, would only bring in one national Democrat to campaign for him, because typically he tried to distance himself from Democrats —  and it was me. And so part of the reason I was willing to run and saw the possibility was that I had had two years in which we were generating enormous crowds all across the country —  and the majority of those crowds were not African American and they were in pretty remote places, or unlikely places. They weren’t just big cities or they weren’t just liberal enclaves. So what that told me was, it was possible. Coates: Did you have doubts? Obama: Yes. Coates: You did have doubts? Obama: Look, I think Valerie remembers us sitting around our kitchen table —  a group of friends of mine, some political advisers, Michelle —  and I think our basic assessment was maybe we had a 20, 25 percent chance of winning. Coates: The presidency? Obama: The presidency, yeah. Because I did think given the problems President Bush had had, that whoever won the Democratic nomination would win the presidency. And so the issue really was, could I get the nomination, particularly with a formidable candidate like Hillary Clinton already preparing to run? And my view was not that this was a sure thing, but what I never doubted was my ability to get white support. Coates: You never doubted that? Obama: No. And I think that in addition to the proof of my Senate race, if you want to go a little deeper, there is no doubt that as a mixed child, as the child of an African and a white woman, who was very close to white grandparents who came from Kansas, that I think the working assumption of discrimination, the working assumption that white people would not treat me right or give me an opportunity, or judge me on the basis of merit —  that kind of working assumption is less embedded in my psyche than it is, say, with Michelle. There is a little bit of a biographical element to this. I had as a child seen at least a small cross section of white people, but the people who were closest to me loved me more than anything. And so even as an adult, even by the time I’m 40, 45, 50, that set of memories meant that if I walked into a room and it’s a bunch of white farmers, trade unionists, middle age —  I’m not walking in thinking, Man, I’ve got to show them that I’m normal. I walk in there, I think, with a set of assumptions: like, these people look just like my grandparents. And I see the same the same   mold that my grandmother served, and they’ve got the same, you know, little stuff on their mantelpieces. And so I am maybe disarming them by just assuming that we’re okay. And if anything, my concern had more to do with I’m really young. I mean, when I look back at the pictures of me running in ’08, I look like a kid. And so my insecurities going into the race had more to do with the fact I had only been in the Senate two years. Three, four years earlier I had been a state legislator, and I was now running for the highest office in the land. Coates: I want to stay with this for a second. You know, to prepare for this piece I’ve been going back and reading some of your writings. And one of the things I noticed going through Dreams From My Father, which I read a long time ago —  it’s very different reading it. Obama: The second time? Coates: Yeah, and then after eight years. Yeah, and then —   Obama: After seeing how things played out. Coates: Right. And one of the things I saw in there: Your grandfather has this black dude come over who’s interested in his daughter, and he’s accepting. Obama: Yeah, listen, I’m always kind of surprised by that. Like I said, it wasn’t Harry Belafonte. This was like an African African. And he was like a   brother. Nilotic. [Laughter] And so, yeah, I will always give my grandparents credit for that. I’m not saying they were happy about it. I’m not saying that they were not, after the guy leaves, looking at each other like, ‘What the heck?’ But whatever misgivings they had, they never expressed to me, never spilled over into how they interacted with me. Now, part of it, as I say in my book, was we were in this unique environment in Hawaii where I think it was much easier. I don’t know if it would have been as easy for them if they were living in Chicago at the time, because the lines just weren’t as sharply drawn in Hawaii as they were on the mainland. But I do think that at the end of the day, some of my confidence that people are people and that the very specific historical experience and sociological reality of racism in this country has made for significant differences between black and white populations, but that people’s basic human impulses are the same. I mean, that just grows out of who I am. It’s a biological necessity for me to believe that, right? And so my politics ultimately would reflect that. There’s one last point about this, though, that then bears on my presidency that I think I should point out in terms of both my confidence that I could win in ’08 but also the fact that I was lucky and maybe a little bit naive: In 2008 I was never subjected to the kind of concentrated vilification of Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, the whole   ecosystem, and so as a consequence, even for my first two years as a senator I was polling at 70 percent. And it was because people basically saw me unfiltered. I was at a   meeting, or I was talking to people directly, or they had met me, or I would speak at a university or go to a VFW hall. But they weren’t seeing some image of me as trying to take away their stuff and give it to black people, and coddle criminals, and all the stereotypes of not just African American politicians but liberal politicians. You started to see that kind of prism being established towards the end of the 2008 race, particularly once Sarah Palin was the nominee. And obviously almost immediately after I was elected, it was deployed in full force. And it had an impact in terms of how a large portion of white voters would see me. And what that speaks to —  and this is something I still strongly believe —  is that the suspicion between races, the way it can manifest itself in politics, in part comes out of people’s daily interactions and the fact that we’re segregated by communities, and by schools, and our churches, and people’s memories passed down through generations. But some of it is constructed on a constant basis it’s being created all the time. And I think what I did not fully appreciate when I first came into this office was the degree to which that reality would be the only thing that a large chunk of the electorate, particularly the white electorate, would see. You know, Bill Clinton told me an interesting story. He went back to Arkansas with a former aide of his when he was governor and when he was running, who ended up running for Congress and was about to retire from Congress. This was one of the last blue dogs. And as they were traveling aroundthis former member of Congress said to Bill, “You know, I don’t think you could win Arkansas today. ” And he said, “Well, why not?” He says, “You know, when we used to run, you and I would drive around to these small towns and communities out there, and you’d meet with the publisher and editor of the little   paper, and you’d have a conversation with them. And they were fairly knowledgeable about some of the issues, and they had their quirks and blind spots, but basically you as a Democrat could talk about civil rights and the need to invest in communities and they understood that. Except now those papers are all gone and if you go into any bar, you go into any barbershop, the only thing that’s on is Fox News. ” And it has shaped an entire generation of voters and tapped into their deepest anxieties   …     Coates: Just as a counterpoint to that, I wonder about another argument one might make —  that you were more likable to these folks before you had power. In other words, once you literally became a black president, that was a real thing. And that activated their fears —   Obama: Yeah, yeah. Look, I think that the —   [long pause] Coates: Like, that they needed Fox News. Obama: Yeah, but what I would argue would be that the folks for whom that is true —  they hadn’t voted for me in the first place. I mean, what I’m arguing is not that the concerns or suspicions or fears around changing demographics and increased diversity aren’t right there on the surface for a lot of voters. They are. But what I’m saying is that they are shaped and influenced depending on what they see day to day. And they are more malleable, and they can go in a better direction or a worse direction. And if what they are seeing and what they are taking as truth is that this black president is trying to hurt you or take something from you and looking out for “his own,” then they will respond differently than if they hear that this president is trying to help you. But it’s hard. And here are the issues involved and here are the choices that he’s having to make. There’s no better example of that than the whole debate around Obamacare, where the whole way in which it got framed as ‘He’s trying to take something from you to give free stuff’ —  in this case free health care but it could also be free phones, or free cheese, or whatever —  ended up dominating the debate even in those communities that stood to benefit most from this program. But part of that was the story, the narrative that they were receiving. And people don’t have the ability to   and, you know, sort through what’s true and what’s not, especially on a complicated social program like this. Coates: Do you think that holds true even in an era right now when we have so much access to information? Obama: Yeah. You know, in some ways the access to all this information has made it easier to set up narratives that are entirely separate from fact. I mean witness the current election and what Trump is doing. There is no grounding in fact. But because, with all the proliferation of websites, and blogs, and digital content, you can just create your own hermetically sealed world where people are never going outside of their existing assumptions, I think it’s a bigger problem, not a worse problem. I guess the point being that: Was there always a certain quotient of people who, even if it was hard for them to admit, would not vote for me because I was African American? Absolutely. That was true when I was running for the U. S. Senate and that would be true if I was trying to catch a cab. Do I believe that’s the majority of white Americans? Absolutely not. And I think my elections proved that. Do I think that good people who are not instinctively afraid or concerned about an African American in authority can be made afraid, and suspicious, and fearful, because of what they are seeing, hearing, and reading if it’s not attached to the facts, and evidence, and reality? I think that can have a big impact. Coates: One of the things that I think also is here is not just your ability to envision the presidency, just the optimism for the country you have in general. I think, at this kind of young age you really saw —  if I may say so —  the best of white America in a very sort of direct way —   Obama: Right. Coates: Which I think is very different than most African Americans. I didn’t really grow up around white people, but even the abstract construction was as a malignant force in my life, which I had to make my way out of much, much later in life, in my 20s, when I had intimate contact. And I wonder how much of that general optimism you think emanates from your biography. The exposure too, the cosmopolitan nature of all you’ve seen. Obama: Yeah. I mean, look, I think all of the above. I think I was deeply loved by my mom and my grandparents. I felt that, and I carried that with me. I spent time outside of the United States, which gives you a perspective on how people of all kinds of different races, and ethnicities, and religions, and backgrounds can figure out ways to divide themselves and try to be superior to others. So that I ended up looking at race in America as one example of a broader human problem, rather than something that was unique and I was trapped in. Right? But I also, I think, benefited from the very particular era that I was growing up in, because in some ways, the last 55 years —  the years I’ve been on this Earth —  have a very particular trajectory of progress that is incomplete, is partial, that   African Americans enjoy in ways that really impoverished African Americans do not yet feel. But that trend would feed my optimism as well. Now, you know, what’s interesting is the work that I did as an organizer in Chicago would help to temper that optimism and ground it so that it wasn’t just a bunch of happy talk. And it’s one of the reasons why, for the generation just ahead of me, I would learn of the anger, frustration, bitterness of my elders and respect it and understand it even if I ultimately did not agree with it. Coates: Did you right off the bat, when you first encountered it? Obama: Yeah. And part of it was just because, you know, I had sort of steeped myself in it, although as still an intellectual exercise. I remember reading The Autobiography of Malcolm X, and I remember reading it, even as a young person, and saying to myself, Now, if this had happened to me, I’d have a very different attitude. Right? And that’s part of what I tried to explain in my race speech in Philadelphia when the Reverend Wright controversies came out. He’s of a different generation. He had different experiences. And that sense of being trapped and caged and witnessing brilliant people broken by an unjust system —  family members beaten or jailed, or just harassed, or unable to realize their potential —  could drive you crazy. And so I think I not only was mindful enough of it by the time I had moved to Chicago, but even in my relatively sheltered and unique circumstances, I had the experiences that every African American has. Which is somebody in front of a restaurant will hand you the keys, thinking you’re there to park their car. Or —  I write about this in Dreams From My Father —  being in a tennis tournament and the tennis coach, who is supposed to look out for all the kids, telling me, ‘Don’t put your finger on the draw that’s been posted about who’s playing who, because you might make it dirty.’ And when you’re 12 years old and look up at some guy, you think: What? Or walking into an elevator and having some woman who you know lives on your floor or above you walk out of the elevator because she’s worried about riding with you even though you’re a kid. So, you know, you have enough there to have a sense of how anger could pool and well up and, in some cases, consume you. But I also, I think, by that point would have benefited from enough circumstances in which assuming the best in people had paid off —  where there had been a teacher who had really been helpful and looked out for me even when I didn’t completely deserve it. Or, you know, just witnessing the example of a Dr. King, or an Arthur Ashe. And so I’m coming of age at a time where you’ve got the strength and defiance of a Malcolm or an Ali, and you’ve also got the soulfulness and the moral strength of a King. And those things are speaking to each other. They’re in a conversation. And you’re saying to yourself, I can draw from both of those traditions. And there may be times where it is right to be angry and defiant. And there may be times where you’ve got to give the country and white people the benefit of the doubt. And if you’re so eager to give them the benefit of the doubt that they slap you down and you don’t know it, that’s a problem. But if you’re so invested in the anger that you don’t seen when somebody is putting out their hand in a sincere gesture of friendship, then you’ve now become your own jailer. It’s not just someone else jailing you. Coates: Right. It occurs to me, obviously, to have our first black president a product of the times, a product of certain things going around, a product in some part of the administration before —  but have you ever thought you needed to be a certain person who had not had this sort of trauma at a young age? Who was capable of giving that sort of optimism —  that it couldn’t just be, okay now the country’s ready, Joe Blow Black Dude steps up, and wins, with political gifts, obviously —  but I think that optimism sticks out. Obama: Yeah. Look, I have no doubt that the first African American president had to be somebody who could speak the way I did in the 2004 convention speech about the ideal of what America is. As opposed to —   Coates: What it isn’t. What it hadn’t done. Obama: Right. But that’s true of just running for president generally. Very rarely has somebody won the presidency based on a dark, grim vision of what America is. Coates: Well, we’re getting close. Obama: Right. Well, we’ll see my proposition tested in this election cycle. Maybe the closest is Nixon, who employed the southern strategy and surfed the backlash coming out of both the antiwar movement and the   movement. But as a general proposition, it’s hard to run for president by telling people how terrible things are. Because at some level what the people want to feel is that the person leading them sees the best in them. And so, did the innate optimism that I carried with me both because of my upbringing and maybe just temperament help? Absolutely. But I’m not sure it had to be me. I’ve said before that Deval Patrick could have been the person who broke that particular barrier back in 2008. And it so happened that he had just run for governor and felt committed to finishing up his term. But he has the gifts and I think the persona that would have appealed at that time to the American public. And there are probably some other figures as well who might have pulled it off. Coates: How did you feel when that optimism was directly challenged? I was telling Valerie this the other day: We’re at home watching the State of the Union and some guy stands up and yells, “You lie. ” Obama: [Laughing] Yeah, that was something. Coates: And this is a guy from South Carolina —  we know about South Carolina, he’s confirming everything we feel —   Obama: Yeah, that was something. I still remember looking at him like, Really? what are you doing? Sit down. Coates: Were you angry? Obama: You know, I’ve got to say, I wasn’t angry so much as I was just stunned. It was just so unexpected and raw that I didn’t —  and to me just kind of ridiculous —  that I couldn’t really generate anger. Coates: And you didn’t feel insulted or   …     ? Obama: Well   …     look. There is no doubt that there have been occasions during my presidency when I’ve said, ‘Y’all just would not do this with anybody else.’ Now, obviously the whole   thing is the most salient example. I mean, there’ve been 43 other presidents. I don’t remember the issue of where somebody was born ever coming up before. And so there have been other instances like that. There was one time where I was making a statement out here. And in the middle of my statement, somebody just started yelling. It was a reporter —   Coates: It was a reporter from The Daily Caller. I remember this. Obama: From The Daily Caller. And I was probably more mad on that one. Because —  whereas Joe Wilson, you got a sense of just this weird impulsive action on his part —  this felt orchestrated and showed a lack of respect for the office that I think was unprecedented in a Rose Garden statement. Part of what’s been difficult, though, during my presidency, is untangling the degree to which some of these issues are because of race and some of these issues being reflective of just a coarsening of the political culture and a sharpening of the political divides. Because I do remember watching Bill Clinton get impeached and Hillary Clinton being accused of killing Vince Foster. And if you ask them, I’m sure they would say, ‘No, actually, what you’re experiencing is not because you’re black, it’s because you’re a Democrat.’ And right around the beginning of Bill Clinton’s presidency and what corresponds with the rise of   media, a lot of the old boundaries and rules of civility just broke down. Now, one way to think about this is that issues of race and issues of political philosophy have always been entangled, and it’s hard to draw them out. Right? So when I think about the Tea Party or conservatives who’ve opposed my agenda, I have no doubt that there are those who oppose my agenda because they have a coherent and sincere view about the role of the federal government relative to the state governments they believe that an overreaching federal power that is taxing, regulating, redistributing is contrary to the vision of freedom that the Founders intended —  and they can believe those things independent of race. Having said that, a rudimentary knowledge of American history tells you that the relationship between the federal government and the states was very much mixed up with attitudes towards slavery, attitudes towards Jim Crow, attitudes towards antipoverty programs and who benefited and who didn’t. And so I’m careful not to attribute any particular resistance or slight or opposition to race. But what I do believe is that if somebody didn’t have a problem with their daddy being employed by the federal government, and didn’t have a problem with the Tennessee Valley Authority electrifying certain communities, and didn’t have a problem with the interstate highway system being built, and didn’t have a problem with the GI Bill, and didn’t have a problem with the [Federal Housing Administration] subsidizing the suburbanization of America, and that all helped you build wealth and create a middle class —  and then suddenly as soon as African Americans or Latinos are interested in availing themselves of those same mechanisms as ladders into the middle class, you now have a violent opposition to them, then I think you at least have to ask yourself the question of how consistent you are and what’s different, what’s changed. You know, I always talk about when I was doing   law and people would talk about the dearth of African Americans in police departments and fire departments around the country. And they would say, ‘Well, this should be a meritocracy, and everybody needs to take a test, and that’s objective, and anything else is affirmative action and unfair.’ And I’m thinking, Well, when Officer O’Malley or Officer Krupke was walking the beat, nobody said it was a meritocracy then. What happened? We’re suddenly now of the notion that somebody who’s a police officer or firefighter having some affinity and familiarity with the community they are serving is completely out of bounds. What changed? So I think that one of the things I’m always trying to do is to just promote a consistent philosophy and ethic about how government can help everybody and try to show that what worked for the majority community in previous generations would be likely to work now, too. And the burden is on those who oppose investments in these things to explain what’s changed. Coates: I was caught because you said that you were the only person that Ben Nelson brought in to campaign for him. And maybe my memory is wrong, but I believe he was one of the harder folks to negotiate with in terms of getting the [Affordable Care Act] passed. You can correct me if I’m wrong, but as I recall, I heard in 2008 from your campaign that there was room to work across party lines, there was room for people who disagree to come together. If we just put forth intelligent proposals, folks would be able to come together. When did you realize it wasn’t quite going to go that way? Obama: In the first two weeks. Mitch McConnell’s statement about how our No. 1 goal was to make sure Obama was a   president. That hadn’t surfaced publicly yet, but —   Coates: Did that surprise you when that got to you? Obama: No, because by that time we had seen the behavior. But, and I’ve told this story before, the economy was in a free fall. And the one thing I anticipated was that we could get some bipartisan cooperation early on, at least to stop the bleeding, before normal politics kicked in. I mean, we were losing hundreds of thousands of jobs, folks were losing their homes everywhere, the financial system was locked up, the auto industry was melting down. And the risks of us going into 15 percent unemployment and a real catastrophic situation were reasonably high. And so speed was of the essence. And we put together this package, called the Recovery Act, which was basically a big stimulus package, and we designed it in such a way that we thought it would have some appeal to Republicans. Because we had infrastructure spending, and we had spending going directly to states to make sure they weren’t laying off teachers and police and firefighters, and we had a big tax cut for ordinary families, as well as spending for clean energy and education and a whole host of other things. And I still remember the day that I’m scheduled to meet with the House Republican caucus, and I get into the car and we’re driving up, and I forget who it was, but one of my staff tells me that John Boehner has just announced that they are opposed to the Recovery Act. Before they had even seen it, before I had made a presentation, before I had had a conversation with them. This was going to be sort of the opening round of negotiations where I’m explaining to them the dire situation and asking for a bipartisan effort to help the American people. And they had shut it down. And that, I think, gave me an inkling of a different political environment than the one that we had seen in the past. Now, again, I think it’s really important to understand that had there been a white president —  had Hillary Clinton been president, or Joe Biden been president —  it is entirely possible that they would have pursued the same strategy. Because the way politics had been structured at that point, where there was so much political gerrymandering, and the media has increasingly become so balkanized, there was an understandable political incentive for them not to cooperate. You know, the genius of Mitch McConnell —  and to some degree John Boehner —  was a recognition that if we were about to go into a bad recession and the president had come in on this wave of good feeling, Democrats control the House, they control the Senate —  if he’s completely successful in yanking us out of this and cleaning up a mess a Republican president had left behind, that we might lock in Democratic majorities for a very long time. But on the other hand, if Republicans didn’t cooperate, and there was not a portrait of bipartisan cooperation and a functional federal government, then the party in power would pay the price and that they could win back the Senate   the House. That wasn’t an inaccurate political calculation. And they executed well, and we got clobbered in 2010. So the lesson I drew there was a political lesson. It was not a racial lesson. Coates: I just want to push this a little bit more. What about the idea that it’s not so much you as a black man as president, but the fact that we’re at a point in history where the Democratic Party, especially locally —  the states —  has become very racialized? Obama: Well, I think what is true is that when the southern Democrats all flipped, and over the course of successive elections, dating back to ’68, you have a process whereby 90 percent African Americans are voting in the Democratic Party, and southern and many rural and western whites are increasingly voting Republican, and cultural issues become more prominent, that it helped to accelerate what has been called this great sorting. And when you combine that with political gerrymandering, when you combine that with the impact of the media, it makes it easier for Republicans not to cooperate, because there’s nobody in their districts that will punish them for not cooperating with a Democratic president. There is no doubt that that’s true. Now, I leave it at this, and maybe we can pick it up in our next conversation: I think what was more of an early lesson around race was the Skip Gates incident. And the reason that was interesting to me was because I didn’t think it was that big of a deal, and I didn’t think my statement was particularly controversial. I don’t know if you know Skip, but Skip is a little guy who uses a cane and has a limp and is late 60s. And if he’s on his porch and he ends up being handcuffed, then my working assumption was, everybody would kind of think that was kind of an overreaction. Now, Skip can be, you know, salty, so I have no doubt that —  I wasn’t there, but I would not be surprised if Skip used some inappropriate language with the officer when the officer came up to question him. And, you know, this wasn’t some great   injustice. But it was interesting to see how what I thought was sort of an offhanded and fairly innocuous statement, which was, look, you know, this probably wasn’t —  I think I said this: The Cambridge police probably handled this a little stupidly. And the fact of the matter is that part of the reason this becomes news is because there’s this underlying feeling on the part of a lot of African Americans that interaction with police is not always evenhanded. To see the cultural reaction, and in retrospect to see how my poll numbers with white voters dropped really significantly off this one tempest in a teapot, that was instructive. Now, there are some who say that’s when Obama started trimming his sails on racial issues. That’s not accurate. That’s not accurate. The truth is that I wanted to make sure that we did not have a bunch of distractions at a time where I’m just putting out fires everywhere. I mean, I’ve got two wars, I’ve got an economic crisis of a proportion we haven’t seen since the Great Depression, and that was not the time, from my perspective, to just open up a big floodgate of conversation around race, which I did not think was going to be productive. What I did learn from that, though, were two things. One was —  that was one lesson among many, in those first six months —  about the magnification of my words. So if I look at the statement that I made at the time that I thought was pretty innocuous, using the word stupid would be a word I’d never use now, just because I’m president and everything gets magnified. So I could have made the same point in a way that would not have, I think, felt as visceral. Coates: You think you could have got that across about it? Obama: I think I could have got it across better. So that’s point No. 1. Point No. 2, though, is: What it also showed me was the degree to which the filter that I discussed earlier can completely shape a narrative in a way that will just run until you get some sort of circuit breaker going. And part of what I had to start teaching my staff was: not to overreact to that. Because what is absolutely true is that, you know, my press office freaked out around that in a way that I was not that freaked out about. There was a part of me that was like, ‘Okay, so the Cambridge police isn’t happy with me, but this really isn’t a big deal, we’ve got other stuff we’ve got to worry about.’ They were channeling what they were seeing coming at them suddenly in the press room and through news reports. And what that meant then was that, on issues of race, certainly on issues of race as it relates to law enforcement, what I wanted to make sure of is that when we said something that was precise, that we were choosing those moments where we had the best chance of driving home the point and extracting real progress. And that we needed to think about how the narrative would be shaped in a way that was constructive rather than us just being on the defense all the time. You know, so it’s interesting for me to think about that moment and then all the subsequent issues that have come up. Coates: Yeah, it got a lot worse than that, than being arrested on your porch. Obama: Well, exactly. Right. But the dynamic around which everybody went to their respective corners on what was such a small incident, it foreshadowed the response that I would get later. And to this day, it does not matter how many times I will say, “You know what? Our police have a tough job and 99 percent of them are doing a great job,” etc. and I will get letters afterwards: “Why are you always throwing cops under the bus? Why do you hate police?” [Laughing] And I literally made my press office sort of put together a packet of something like 30 statements that I’ve made, highlighted in yellow, that I will send to constituents —  because oftentimes, you know, these are the wives of police officers who are scared for their husbands, and I don’t want to ignore them. But it tells me what they’re seeing. It tells me what they’re hearing. The filter through which they are receiving information is powerful. And that was an early lesson about how powerful that filter was.", "sentence": {"content": "<div> In “My President Was Black,” The Atlantic’s Coates examined Barack Obama’s tenure in office, and his legacy.

Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who is appearing on Capitol Hill this week for his confirmation hearings to be the next commissioner of the U. S.

A vaccine for meningitis B called Bexsero had been approved in the European Union, Australia, and Canada, but was not available in the United States, so university administrators had to apply to the FDA for special permission to import it and administer it to their students. That took nine months  —   too long for Emily, who died before the vaccine arrived. Amazingly, it took the FDA almost two more years after Emily’s death to finally approve Bexsero for general use in the United States. If there had been reciprocity between the EMA and the FDA, there would have been no need for American college students facing a deadly outbreak of meningitis B to wait to get the   vaccine. \tOr take idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) a fatal lung disease for which there was no effective treatment, until a drug company named InterMune developed a breakthrough therapy called pirfenidone that reduces scarring in the lungs and thus extends life. In March 2010, an FDA advisory panel recommended approval of pirfenidone, but the FDA said no and demanded additional data. The FDA did not finally approve the drug until October 15, 2014  —   two years after Health Canada, three years and eight months after the EMA, and four years and seven months after its own advisory committee voted overwhelmingly to approve it. About 40, 000 Americans die each year of IPF. That means an estimated 183, 000 Americans lost their lives while the FDA was dithering, withholding the only known treatment for this disease. \tReciprocity will give a voice  —   and a chance  —   to the countless Americans who are dying silently each year while promising treatments are bottled up at the FDA. Doctors without Borders is famous for saving patients regardless of where they live. Medical advances, too, should be freed from false borders.
