    "Earlier this week, Fox News’ Tucker Carlson asked a guest on his show if it were true that the United States government has been “looting” Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. [His guest, a mortgage industry analyst named Joshua Rosner, described the bailout that has kept alive the two mortgage finance giants since their collapse in 2008 and subsequent need for $187. 5 billion of taxpayer funding, as “a simple theft. ”   Not a theft from taxpayers —  but from Fannie and Freddie’s shareholders. While it was jarring to see Carlson and Fox not even attempt to challenge an advocate for the two   mortgage companies —  long the targets of conservative critics who argued they distorted mortgage markets, enjoyed a privileged status of being   by the U. S. government even before they were bailed out, and were primary causes of the financial crisis —  Rosner’s basic argument is hardly new. Hedge funds and other big investors, including Perry Capital LLC and the Fairholme Funds, have been making similar arguments in federal courts for years —  to no avail. The cases have been met by dismissal in four federal district courts and last month a federal appeals court largely rejected the bid by investors to reverse one of those decisions. On Fox, however, Rosner gave the shareholder cause a novel twist —  one designed to appeal to conservatives and perhaps the Trump administration despite its lack of grounding in evidence or logic. According to Rosner, the U. S. Treasury is taking funds from Fannie and Freddie to pay for Obamacare —  perhaps the one thing loathed more by conservatives than bailouts of putatively private companies. “Essentially, in 2012, to avoid dealing with Republicans on the debt ceiling, on sequester, and to fund Obamacare, the Obama administration took Fannie and Freddie’s profits,” Rosner said. The message: if you hate Obamacare, you should support the cause of the hedge funds seeking to profit by prying Fannie and Freddie out of government hands.  And please pay no attention to the fact that the two companies have always needed —  and will always need, unless they are eliminated —  the backing of the U. S. taxpayer.  Fannie and Freddie: The Walking Dead, Fannie and Freddie provide liquidity to the housing market by buying mortgages from lenders, packaging them into securities whose principal and interest payments they guarantee. Prior to their 2008 collapse, Fannie and Freddie were widely viewed as enjoying an “implicit guarantee” from the U. S. government, enabling them to earn enormous profits because investors viewed their bonds as being safe —  or nearly so —  as U. S. Treasury bonds, The companies were taken over by the U. S. government in 2008 when officials feared their collapse could further destabilize the housing and financial markets. Treasury provided hundreds of billions of funding while the Federal Housing Finance Agency became their conservator.   Under their original agreement with the U. S. Treasury, both companies were supposed to pay a dividend equal to 10% of their taxpayer funding as well as a fee on the hundreds of billions more Treasury had pledged to support them. For years, however, neither company earned enough to pay the dividend, which forced them to draw even more from their bailout funds just to send the money back to Treasury as the dividend. This circular draw, as it came to be called, threatened to put the companies into a death spiral, slowly eating away at the remainder of the Treasury backstop. In   Treasury and the FHFA agreed to change the terms of the bailout so that Fannie and Freddie would no longer have a fixed dividend —  ending the need for circular draws. Instead, each company would have a flexible dividend obligation that would rise and fall with their profits. Because the new dividend is equal to the positive net worth of each company, less a small capital cushion set to decline each year, it is known as the “net worth sweep. ” At the time the net worth sweep was implemented, Treasury Department officials noted that in addition to ending the circular draws and death spiral, the arrangement would facilitate the eventual wind down of the companies by preventing them from using profits to recapitalize as   designed a safe, more stable mortgage finance system.  Because every attempt at bipartisan mortgage finance reform legislation stalled out on Capitol Hill, neither company has been  . Instead, they have remained in conservatorship and supported by taxpayer backing for more than eight years —  a situation that nearly everyone involved in mortgage finance reform regards as undesirable. “These companies are zombies. They died in 2008 but they’ve been kept alive by the contaminant of government backing ever since —  all because every attempt to build a better system has gone nowhere,” said one former government housing official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Conservatives Balk At Net Worth Sweep For Keeping Companies Alive, The net worth sweep was designed by the Obama administration in part to placate conservative critics of the two companies. Obama housing officials believed that merely lowering the dividend obligation to a level the companies could afford would invite criticism from Republican lawmakers that Fannie and Freddie were getting a second bailout —  a bailout from their bailout. Since the net worth sweep would produce larger dividends if the companies were highly profitable and lower dividends when they were not, it balanced the risks to taxpayers with potential rewards, in the view of several Obama administration officials who spoke on background. Nonetheless, the net worth sweep met with initial resistance from Republican lawmaker who feared it would delay the wind down of the companies. “The reduction of the dividend payments for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will ensure the American taxpayers remain on the hook for the bailout of these two failed institutions,” Congressman Scott Garrett ( ) the chairman of the House Financial Service Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Entities, said in a statement.  “Instead of devoting time and energy to prolonging bailouts, Obama administration should work with Congress to wind these companies down and create a new and sustainable housing finance system where taxpayers are not at risk,” Rep. Garrett said. This prompted an email, made public in one of the shareholder lawsuits, from an Obama administration official named Jim Parrott to complain that the net worth sweep had been misunderstood.  “We’re not reducing their dividend but including in it every dime these guys make going forward and ensuring that they can’t recapitalize,” Parrott wrote to one of Rep. Garrett’s staffers. This didn’t fully satisfy the staffer. “In regards to them keeping additional profits, in my mind that is only an accounting issue, gov recoups now (per new method) or later when we liquidate them and then realize those gains for the taxpayer,” the staffer wrote back. Summarizing the    Parrott wrote to the Treasury Department’s Timothy Bowler: “We’ve closed off possibility that they every [sic] go (pretend) private again and sped up the clock on the wind down of their portfolio, all while increasing the stability of the markets by removing concern that these guys run out of support before we have a place to which to transition. ” Despite this initial resistance, however, there was very little sustained opposition from conservatives to the net worth sweep —  largely because it was presented as a step toward the wind down of Fannie and Freddie.  The Hedge Funds Strike Back, Resistance to the sweep arose from another, unanticipated quarter: hedge fund managers and other large investors who acquired large amounts of the preferred and common shares of Fannie and Freddie —  betting that the government wouldn’t succeed in winding them down and that they would eventually be revived. Several hedge funds made a fortune in the wake of the financial crisis by snapping up shares of   financial companies, such as failed insurance giant AIG and banking giants Citigroup Bank of America, when many investors still shunned the sector. Investors like Bruce Berkowitz of Fairholme and John Paulson of Paulson  Co, who had made a fortune shorting housing before the crisis, came to see themselves as heroic allies of the government’s attempt to rescue the financial companies. Some former Obama administration officials encouraged them to see Fannie and Freddie as presenting similar opportunities. If the government couldn’t wind down the entities, these former officials said, it might wind up recapitalizing them and releasing them to the public —  just as it had with AIG. With the common shares trading at pennies a share and the preferred at deep discounts to face value, the upside potential could be huge. Perry Capital, Paulson  Co, and Fairholme Funds all acquired stakes in the companies. Later, activist investor William Ackman’s Pershing Square would become the largest holder of the common stock of Fannie and Freddie. Others followed the lead of these prominent investors. The trouble was that the Obama administration did not go along with what the hedge fund managers believed to be the script to their next windfall play. It insisted that the companies remain in conservatorship —  and subject to the net worth sweep —  so long as no comprehensive housing finance reform was forthcoming. Which meant that instead of acting as allies of government policies, the funds were now fighting it. Perry Capital, Fairholme and Pershing Square all sued the government in federal court. They argued that the ongoing conservatorship violated the law and that they net worth sweep illegally deprived them of the profits of the companies.  It quickly became conventional wisdom on Wall Street that the net worth sweep was “obviously illegal. ” Shares of the companies rocketed upward as investors piled into the trade that the “smart money” had endorsed. Top flight legal scholars, such as New York University’s Richard Epstein and Yale University’s Jonathan Macey, added their support to the hedge fund cause —  in Epstein’s case, at least, while receiving consulting fees from one of the investors. Hopes for a court room victory were bolstered as Fannie and Freddie turned in record profits in 2013 and 2014, thanks in part to reversals of past losses,   of once abandoned deferred tax assets, and legal settlements with large banks. Shareholders gleefully declared the government’s worry about a death spiral as a ruse and described the mortgage giants as “the most profitable companies in the world,” ignoring warnings that the artificially high profit levels would soon fall. In subsequent years, however, profits did fall by enough that both companies would once again have struggled or failed to pay the original 10 percent dividend. The Influence Vultures Take Flight, Paulson  Co did not join the lawsuits, although his internal legal advisors believed the courts would side with the investors, according to people familiar with the matter. But that didn’t mean Paulson sat by passively. Instead, Paulson helped finance a behind the scenes lobbying campaign urging the government to relinquish its controls on the mortgage giants, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. Lobbying efforts included campaign donations to sympathetic politicians as well as giving cash to minority advocacy groups that voiced support for Fannie and Freddie, the Wall Street Journal reported. Some advocacy groups in Washington, D. C. began offering donations to groups and individuals who agreed to write   advocating for the release and recapitalization of Fannie and Freddie, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. The Wall Street Journal reported that the Raban Group, a Washington lobbying firm, offered a minority trade association $25, 000 contingent on signing its name to an   arguing for the    of Fannie and Freddie, according to the Wall Street Journal. In 2014, John Paulson’s private foundation donated $25, 000 to the Leadership Conference Education Fund, an arm of a coalition of   civil rights advocacy groups, the Wall Street Journal revealed. The Leadership Conference has been an outspoken advocate for the release of Fannie and Freddie to private control.  The DCI Group, a Washington lobbyist outfit that works on behalf of Fannie and Freddie shareholder pressure group Investors Unite, gave the Leadership Conference a total of $325, 000 in donations, according to the Wall Street Journal.  In June of 2016, a group of primarily   New York Baptist ministers calling itself ‘Our Loans Matter’ held a rally near Wall Street. Video of the rally was posted on Twitter by none other than Tucker Carlson’s Obamacare funding critic Josh Rosner, who is manging director at Graham Fisher  Co. which bills itself as an independent research consultancy. The accompanying hashtag: #ourloansmatter.  “Wow.  #OurLoansMatter rally in Wall Street w leading Pastors,” Rosner said in another tweet. Wow. #OurLoansMatter rally in Wall Street w leading Pastors pic. twitter.   —   joshua rosner (@JoshRosner) June 17, 2016,  The Our Loans Matter group decried efforts to   Fannie and Freddie, saying they would hurt homeownership opportunities for “our parishioners,” in an October 2016 letter to New York’s Senator Chuck S`chumer and the FHFA’s Mel Watt. That same summer, Rosner appeared on Perspectives, a television show “geared to discussing contemporary topics affecting the   community. ” His message there was very different than the one he delivered to Tucker Carlson about Fannie and Freddie’s profits allegedly being used to support Obamacare. Instead, he argued that the government is “now in the process of eliminating Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, essentially to hand the business to the big banks, who already are the ones who are likely to overcharge borrowers for home loans. ” There’s no evidence that most big banks want to be in the business of being in the   position on the types of loans Fannie and Freddie tend to back. In fact, the biggest banks have been losing market share to nonbank lenders and retreating from the riskier parts of the market. Rosner went on to argue that eliminating Fannie and Freddie would reduce minority homeownership —  and thereby increase crime, damage the quality of education and reduce people to being “wage slaves. ” Rosner has long been an advocate of homeownership while still criticizing loose credit the practices of banks as well as Fannie and Freddie. Indeed, he was one of the few who understood years before the financial crisis that Fannie and Freddie had taken on —  and disguised —  far more credit risk than they should. He famously criticized low to no downpayment mortgages by saying, “A home without equity is just a rental with debt. ” Currently, he argues that Fannie and Freddie should become   utilities whose profits and practices are stringently regulated but whose shares are owned by investors. His views are not influenced by hedge funds or other investors in Fannie and Freddie, he said. “I put my own views out there and I’ve been remarkably consistent. Anyone who looks at my record knows I’m not for sale,” Rosner said in an phone interview.   Crash and Burn, Despite the sums spent on lobbying and litigating against the government, the hedge funds and other investors did not gain much traction. The Obama administration stood firm in its position that Fannie and Freddie would not be released or recapitalized without congressional action. Capitol Hill lawmakers agreed, including in 2015’s omnibus budget “sense of Congress” provision that demanded the the administration make no changes to Fannie and Freddie’s status without congressional approval. The passage of time did not improve the odds for the hedge funds. As recently as last week, a bipartisan group of Senators sent a letter to FHFA director Mel Watt, who oversees the conservatorships of Fannie and Freddie, that he should not allow the companies to recapitalize without congressional approval. The lawmakers warned against “any administrative action that would adversely impact” efforts underway to legislate housing finance reform. If Capitol Hill and the White House have been cool to the hedge funds’ pleas, the reception in federal courts has been even frostier. In the fall of 2014, a federal court completely dismissed a group of shareholder lawsuits, finding that the government acted well within its rights when it implemented the net worth sweep. At first, the decision was derided by shareholders and their advocates but as court after court reached similar conclusions —  including the influential D. C. Circuit —  hopes for a hedge fund win in the courts withered. Rosner points out that the Obama administration kept from the public over 10, 000 documents investors have sought in connection with the litigation, a practice that the Trump administration has continued. He argues that the documents are likely to show that the motivations for putting in the net worth sweep were different from those stated by government officials. In any case, the public deserves to know what is in those documents, Rosner says. “Let’s see what’s in them. I think it will be  . If I’m wrong about the motivations here, I’ll be the first to say so,” Rosner said in a phone interview. Hope Revived, Briefly  The election of Donald Trump as President briefly revived hopes that the administration would embrace a policy that would bring the   windfall to Fannie and Freddie investors. Although Trump himself has not taken a position on housing finance reform, Fannie investor John Paulson had been a big fund raiser for Trump, hosting a $50, 000 per plate dinner in NYC. Paulson was reportedly picked to be the Trump transition teams advisor on housing policy. What’s more, Trump had reportedly invested between $3 million and $15 million in Paulson’s hedge fund. A day after he was tapped to be Trump’s Treasury Secretary nominee, Steve Mnuchin appeared to bolster the prospects that the hedge funds could finally wrest control of Fannie and Freddie from the government.  “We got to get Fannie and Freddie out of government ownership,” Steven Mnuchin said on Fox Business Network in November. “It makes no sense that these are owned by the government and have been controlled by the government for as long as they have. ” “Trump Treasury May Mean Independence for Fannie and Freddie,” the New York Times declared in a headline. The accompanying article was written by columnist Gretchen Morgenson, who   2011’s Reckless Endangerment with Josh Rosner. Shares of Fannie and Freddie soared. Morgenson described the euphoria among the   Fannie and Freddie investors that followed these comments:  The revival of this particular dream of avarice, however, was quickly quashed. At his confirmation hearing in January, Mnuchin told the Senators his comments had been misinterpreted. “My comments were never that there should be a recap and release,” Mnuchin said. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has continued to fight the hedge funds in court —  and continued to stack up legal victories. There are no signs that the Justice Department, Treasury, or the FHFA is considering settling with the litigious hedge funds or backing away from the government’s strong hand in these lawsuits. Sources inside the Treasury Department say the administration is still reviewing a wide variety of housing financing reforms options but is not planning on making any changes to the conservatorship or dividend of Fannie and Freddie without congressional authorization. On Capitol Hill, Senators and Representatives are already at work on a new version of housing finance reform legislation —  one that is unlikely to leave any value left over for shareholders of Fannie and Freddie, according to people familiar with the matter. “These guys overreached and they’ve accomplished something rare: bipartisan alienation. Both Republican and Democrat leaders can’t stand these Fannie hedge fund guys,” a person close to Capitol Hill housing reform efforts said. Time Traveling Obama Officials and Other Villians, Despite this most recent setback, efforts continue to influence the right to adopt the hedge funds’ position on Fannie and Freddie, in hopes that the Trump administration can still be brought around to changing its views.   legal scholars have been recruited and, in some cases, paid to write   and conservative outlets such as the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Daily Caller have run pieces adopting the hedge fund line on Fannie, Freddie, and the net worth sweep.  The latest argument appears   to lure in conservatives with claims that the Obama administration illicitly diverted funds from Fannie and Freddie to bankroll portions of the Affordable Care Act. Specifically, the funds were allegedly used to provide a substitute funding source after a federal court ruled that some subsidies that had been provided to insurers were improper. The trouble is that the changes to Fannie and Freddie’s bailout that net worth sweep in place were made in 2012, while the judge’s ruling on the Obamacare subsidies didn’t come until 2016. What’s more, the judge in the case has allowed the payments to continue pending appeal, which means there still isn’t a budget gap to fill. Absent a trip in Dr. Who’s TARDIS, it is unlikely the Obama administration foresaw an adverse court ruling four years in advance then put in place a controversial change to Fannie and Freddie’s bailout to avoid it. Another recent tactic has been to target those in the Trump administration viewed as both vulnerable and potential opponents of the hedge fund Fannie and Freddie agenda. Craig Phillips, a former BlackRock Inc. executive who was a big fundraiser for Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid, has recently come under fire. Phillips is leading Treasury’s review financial regulations —  and many on Capitol Hill worry he is not a supporter of the administration’s agenda to rollback the regulations. Supporters of the hedge fund agenda for Fannie and Freddie have been playing on these concerns and Phillips’ connections to former Obama administration officials in hopes that if conservatives were to force Phillips out, he could be replaced by a more pliant Treasury official. “They’ve flipped from seeking support from the civil rights types to seeking support from conservatives and libertarians,” said a staffer of a Republican Congressman who has been approached about his position on Fannie and Freddie. This type of political flexibility is not altogether unheard of in the nation’s capital. Back in 2011, Josh Rosner, who advocated for preserving Fannie and Freddie to preserve minority homeowners in 2016 and decried the alleged use of their funds to support Obamacare in 2017, appeared before a House oversight panel alongside Dr. Anthony Sanders, a George Mason University finance professor. “I really want to go with what the administration said earlier, which is to start paring them down if not dismantling them,” Sanders told the panel after arguing that Fannie and Freddie’s guarantees were keeping private capital out of the mortgage market. “I totally agree with that,” Rosner said moments later.

    "From the beginning, the Chainsmokers knew dance music was a joke. The festivals, the groupthink, the   sounds  —   these were the hallmarks of a scene designed for ecstatic release, but also one that was easily parodied. And so rather than make serious music that others might dismiss, they embodied parody themselves. They made songs about selfies and Kanye West (in so much as they were about anything) and saw their stars rise. They seemed to understand, in a particularly disquieting way, how easy it was to game the system, turning growing American interest in and tolerance of   dance music into a platform for   ambition. That made the Chainsmokers both disorientingly effective and easily loathed. So maybe it’s humility, or maybe it’s strategy, but pointedly, over the last couple of years, the duo of Andrew Taggart and Alex Pall have been engaged in a very public process of dismantling mainstream dance music from within. By this point, they are essentially a pop duo  —   Mr. Taggart sings and writes, and both men produce. Instead of   club music though, they’ve come to specialize in a style that approximates a skinned and deboned version of those sounds, maintaining a handful of its key gestures and flourishes while administering a benzodiazepine to the tempo and volume. In 2015 and 2016, three Chainsmokers songs reached the Top 10 of the Billboard singles chart, as have two songs that appear on their new album, “Memories  …    Do Not Open,” “Paris” and the Coldplay collaboration “Something Just Like This. ” Each hit has been more denuded than the one that preceded it. This is the logical endpoint of the American   explosion of the last decade, which was almost certainly never going to end in a nightclub. It was a long con in retraining pop ears to accept some of that world’s sonic ideas. By that measurement, “Memories  …    Do Not Open”  —   the first   Chainsmokers album  —   is a savvy success that cannily toys with expectations. Most songs hover between 95 and 105 beats per minute, something more than a slog but less than a gallop. Often, when a song arrives at the drop  —   the place where an explosion usually lands  —   it instead veers into something like a sun shower, or a crowd applauding in the distance, rarely the usual gut punch. But these strategic victories don’t overshadow the Chainsmokers’ myriad weaknesses. In the ecosystem in which the Chainsmokers have thrived  —     dance music and the pop that derives from its distillation  —   the album is a meaningless concept, and the album format underscores both this duo’s weaknesses and strengths. Mr. Taggart is a capable but unexciting singer. And he has shockingly few lyrical ideas, less of a concern for performers more adept with melody. Most songs here moan about brittle young relationships over the musical equivalent of bringing an amiable golden retriever along for an unhurried jog. (The songs written with the   Emily Warren, like “Don’t Say” and the excellent “My Type,” are among the best here, with an emotional texture the others grasp for futilely.) Two    songs, the impressive “Honest” and “Wake Up Alone,” parse the weight that fame exacts on emotional relationships  —   they’re among the most credible on the album. While the Chainsmokers often appear to have decided what sort of music they’re not making, their affirmative choices are lacking. “The One” ends up somewhere near chillwave, “Break Up Every Night” is toothless   and “Last Day Alive,” a collaboration with the   duo Florida Georgia Line, is 100 percent pure pablum, a collection of dim anthemic sayings in search of a stadium, a twinkle with no diamond. All of this makes for songs in search of remixes, skeletons notable as much for what’s missing as what’s there. That’s a curious position for an act moving from the world of   festivals, where the scene is the star more than the performer, to the world of pop, where personality counts, a shift that may well be the Chainsmokers’ undoing, even if their music remains effective. That’s because onstage, on the duo’s handful of televised performances, they’re almost brutally awkward. On “Saturday Night Live”  —   where they performed “Paris” and “Break Up Every Night” last weekend  —   they were listless and limp. Of course they were. Mr. Taggart is not an aggressively trained pop star (and for what it’s worth, not a disruptive punk either). He was uncomfortable in the same way a young indie rock or folk singer might be, unsure of how to use his body as effectively as his voice. The Chainsmokers might have gamed their way into pop, but pop is hard work  —   inside jokes melt under the klieg lights.": "20085",
    "China’s leaders have been accused of delivering a calculated diplomatic snub to Barack Obama after the US president was not provided with a staircase to leave his plane during his chaotic arrival in Hangzhou before the start of the G20. Chinese authorities have rolled out the red carpet for leaders including India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, the South Korean president, Park   Brazil’s president, Michel Temer, and the British prime minister, Theresa May, who touched down on Sunday morning.  But the leader of the world’s largest economy, who is on his final tour of Asia, was forced to disembark from Air Force One through a   exit in the plane’s belly after no rolling staircase was provided when he landed in the eastern Chinese city on Saturday afternoon. When Obama did find his way on to a red carpet on the tarmac below there were heated altercations between US and Chinese officials, with one Chinese official caught on video shouting: “This is our country! This is our airport!” “The reception that President Obama and his staff got when they arrived here Saturday afternoon was bruising, even by Chinese standards,” the New York Times reported.  Jorge Guajardo, Mexico’s former ambassador to China, said he was convinced Obama’s treatment was part of a calculated snub. “These things do not happen by mistake. Not with the Chinese,” Guajardo, who hosted presidents Enrique Peña Nieto and Felipe Calderón during his time in Beijing, told the Guardian.  “I’ve dealt with the Chinese for six years. I’ve done these visits. I took Xi Jinping to Mexico. I received two Mexican presidents in China. I know exactly how these things get worked out. It’s down to the last detail in everything. It’s not a mistake. It’s not. ” Guajardo added: “It’s a snub. It’s a way of saying: ‘You know, you’re not that special to us.’ It’s part of the new Chinese arrogance. It’s part of stirring up Chinese nationalism. It’s part of saying: ‘China stands up to the superpower.’ It’s part of saying: ‘And by the way, you’re just someone else to us.’ It works very well with the local audience. “Why [did it happen]?” the former diplomat, who was ambassador from 2007 until 2013, added. “I guess it is part of Xi Jinping playing the nationalist card. That’s my guess. ” Bill Bishop, a China expert whose Sinocism newsletter tracks the country’s political scene, agreed that Obama’s welcome looked suspiciously like a deliberate slight intended “to make the Americans look diminished and weak”. “It sure looks like a   snub,” Bishop said. “This clearly plays very much into the [idea]: ‘Look, we can make the American president go out of the ass of the plane. ’”  Bishop added: “We’ve no proof. It could clearly just be a   but it would be a stunningly large   given how well these people plan for all these events and especially for something like the G20. The idea that they have been preparing for well over a year for the G20 but suddenly there be a malfunction with the ramp just for one president   …     that really strains credulity. ” A Chinese foreign ministry official involved in the visit denied it had been a snub, telling the South China Morning Post the US delegation had declined to use the usual rolling   staircase.  “It would do China no good in treating Obama rudely,” the official, who declined to be named, was quoted as saying.  “China provides a rolling staircase for every arriving state leader, but the US side complained that the driver doesn’t speak English and can’t understand security instructions from the United States so China proposed that we could assign a translator to sit beside the driver, but the US side turned down the proposal and insisted that they didn’t need the staircase provided by the airport,” the official added. The US president offered a diplomatic reply when asked to comment on the airport “kerfuffle” on Sunday during a joint press conference with Theresa May. “I wouldn’t   the significance of it because, as I said, this is not the first time that these things happen and it doesn’t just happen here. It happens in a lot of places including, by the way, sometimes our allies,” Obama said, adding that “none of this detracts from the broader scope of the relationship”. Obama suggested his Chinese hosts might have found the size of the US delegation “a little overwhelming”.  “We’ve got a lot of planes, a lot of helicopters, a lot of cars and a lot of guys. If you are a host country, sometimes it may feel a little bit much. ”  Susan Rice, the US national security adviser, admitted she had been surprised by the handling of the president’s arrival. “They did things that weren’t anticipated,” she told reporters.  The New York Times said Rice had appeared “baffled and annoyed” that the president had been forced to leave Air Force One through a door normally reserved for   trips to places such as Afghanistan.  In the   to the final meeting between Obama and Xi, experts had predicted the pair would seek to part ways on a positive note with the announcement that the world’s two largest polluters would ratify the Paris climate agreement.  However, Obama’s unconventional welcome  —   and a series of subsequent skirmishes and quarrels between Chinese and US officials and journalists  —   were a reminder of the underlying tensions.  The Washington Post said Obama’s bumpy landing in China was “a fitting reflection of how the relationship between these two world powers has become frayed and fraught with frustration”.  “I think this time   …     maybe the seams were showing a little more than usual in terms of some of the negotiations and jostling that takes place behind the scenes,” Obama admitted on Sunday.  Official statements issued by both sides on Saturday, as the pair held more than four hours of bilateral meetings, hinted at some of the disagreements between the world’s two largest economies.  According to a White House statement, Obama told Xi of “America’s unwavering support for upholding human rights”.  “China opposes any other country interfering in its internal affairs in the name of human rights issues,” Xi told Obama in response, according to Xinhua, Beijing’s official news wire.  In an interview with CNN, Obama warned Beijing against   in the South China Sea. Xi told Obama his country would “unswervingly safeguard” its claims in the region.  Bishop said: “Other than in climate, in most areas of the   relationship there is increasing amounts of friction and some actually increasingly quite hot friction around the South China Sea and some of these military [interactions] in the region. ” “The US is looking a little weak and a little tired and I think [Beijing is] happy to put anybody in their place when they can. I think they see the opportunity to make Obama look weak,” he added.  Both Bishop and Guajardo said the reported confrontations between Chinese and US officials and journalists following Obama’s arrival in Hangzhou were par for the course in China. “That is just typical China. I remember when my president came, one of the Mexican press corps came out of it with stitches,” Guajardo recalled. But Obama’s unceremonious arrival was unusual and surely deliberate, the former Mexican ambassador added. “Just as the Chinese are about giving face they are also about not giving it and letting you know that they are not giving it to you   …     They don’t overlook these things by mistake. It’s not who they are. It’s not the way they do these things,” he said.": "157645",
    "(CNN) It’s been a rough week for America, but it’s been a good week for masculinity. No, not because we had to endure another display of Donald Trump’s bellicose machismo, but because we witnessed two of the most powerful men in the world allow themselves to shed tears in public. Speaking of his love and appreciation for first lady Michelle Obama, President Obama was moved to tears.  And, surprised by the president’s decision to award him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Vice President Joe Biden cried, too. Might it be that we are finally, blessedly, moving beyond a world in which ”big boys don’t cry”? To be sure, there are resisters and naysayers. To take one example, media personality Laura Ingraham insisted that Obama’s crying was an act. After all, she said, ”I’ve never seen a man grab a tissue and dab, I’ve just never seen that . ..  A man will be like ’whatever’ or, like, fake through it or something.” In other words, even though he might be moved to cry, a real man would never show it. Eight years ago, Ingraham mocked NFL star Brett Favre for being a ”big hulky man” who ”broke down blubbering” at this retirement press conference.” ”Enough with the waterworks,” she demanded.  Can a real man not cry? And if he does, must he hide it? I say: Let the tears flow. What makes someone a ”real man”? Who do we want our sons to be? And who do we want fathers and husbands to be? Is the only ”real man” an alpha male, one who denies his own vulnerability    sometimes denying it so forcefully that he mocks or denigrates (or maybe just sneers at) those he sees as less than perfect, as too vulnerable, as insufficiently tough and guarded? Might it be that in this day and age a major part of what it ought to mean to be a man is an ability to admit that we are vulnerable, to be as tender as we are tough, to live with our hearts open and to refuse to be ashamed about it?  I am grateful to live at a time when a man    the most powerful man in the world, no less    can model what it means to let life affect him to the point where tears come. Would you want to be married to a man who has never been moved to tears by his love and appreciation of another human being? But I am not kidding myself. We have a long way to go in transforming masculinity. There are still far too many men    and, if we take Ingraham’s comments as evidence, women    who insist that real men don’t cry, that a man with a tissue is really just a ”sissy.” (That kind of regressive masculinity, it seems, will now enter the Oval Office.)  Make no mistake: That kind of thinking and talking has real consequences for men and boys. My father died suddenly when I was 12 years old, and I remember    it is etched into my mind and my body    being firmly instructed by a   relative, ”You can’t cry. You have to hold it together.” I recall being told by countless visitors that ”I had to be strong for my mother.” And so I walked around for years pretending to be OK, tough, strong, even though I had just lost everything. That kind of repression takes a toll on a man’s emotional and physical health. Can a man not be strong and cry    without shame? Perhaps we can model the courage it takes to cry when our heart hurts and the world seems to have fallen apart. Perhaps we can model the presence and openheartedness that make it possible to cry because the love another person has for us nourishes and sustains us.  I hope my sons will one day find a love so deep that it moves them to tears, and I hope that they remain unaffected by those who would deprive them of the full range of human emotion. When all is said and done, those who mock men who cry do little but betray their own emotional impoverishment.": "50729",
    "(CNN) There’s a pioneering education nonprofit in Boston that uses stories of past bigotry to teach young people about tolerance. It’s called ”Facing History and Ourselves.” Which pretty much sums up our national challenge for the foreseeable future. Last week, when the Rachel Dolezal media circus was in full swing, the subtext of the coverage and debate was that ”this is all so fascinatingly 21st century.” Coming so soon after Caitlyn Jenner’s transgender declaration, Dolezal’s masquerade raised convoluted, sometimes comical questions about whether it is possible or permissible now to claim race as a matter of mere personal preference. The shooting in Charleston ended that   reverie.  The vicious killings at the Emanuel AME Church on Wednesday reminds us brutally that race in 2015 isn’t only about fluid boundaries, elective minority status, or a postmodern sense of identity in transition. Race    for   especially    is still often a hard social marker. In this case, a target.  There is a sickness in our society, as Senator Rand Paul said, that is about violence and mental illness. But there is a deeper sickness    race hatred    which is ”weaponized” by such easy access to guns. And underlying that is a deeper sickness still: the American penchant for avoiding the past and its meaning. Today    Thursday, June 18    the United States Supreme Court, with Justice Clarence Thomas as the pivotal vote, ruled that Texas is within its rights to ban Confederate flag license plates. Today, the    continues to fly at a Confederate Soldiers Monument in South Carolina. Today, images of Dylann Roof posing with that flag or the flags of   South Africa and Rhodesia went viral. Today is not, as the cliché goes, the first day of the rest of your life. Today is the most recent day of the many lives that came before yours. Rachel Dolezal’s ”race, lies, and videotape” farce was the product of her desire to escape her own history, to claim another group’s history. She could not. She should not have tried.  The Charleston shooting, rooted in a deep tradition of   violence, is also part of an inescapable history. There are too many anguished echoes to tally. There are the church bombings of the civil rights era just half a century ago. There are the lynchings, murders, bombings, riots, and rapes that were the enforcement arm of the unwritten codes of segregation. There is the violence, physical and legal, done to slaves since before there was a Constitution or a United States. This racialized violence was used to make and enforce boundaries of race    and let’s be clear, to define race in terms of blackness versus  . It was not an incidental aspect of the American republic, the Confederate rebellion, or   revivalism today. It is at the very core of our nation’s history and contemporary civic life. We have to reckon with it much more openly. Not ”without judgment,” as people are prone to say in this time of fragile feelings, but with quite strong judgment of history and ourselves: with a   sense that it is possible and necessary both to damn racism and to admit how much of it exists in our own hearts. Except we shouldn’t wait for another Lincoln. We should each, in our own little domains, be another Lincoln. We should open conversations, public and private, about the real history of   racialism as well as racism in our institutions    our churches, our colleges, our companies, our town squares and public buildings.  And not just in the Deep South. That’s too easy. Not even just in a city like Spokane, Washington, which has few  . But also in every part of the North and West where the Great Migration of nearly a century ago changed the face of the big cities. In every part of New England, where so many great arts and education institutions were built on the labor of slaves. You might ask what good all this excavation of the past will do. It won’t equalize educational or economic opportunity for  . It won’t guarantee the voting rights of   citizens. It won’t protect   from police brutality or common criminality. But it will remind us why those tasks matter morally and urgently    and why the hashtag #AllLivesMatter is a defensive and   response to #BlackLivesMatter. It will make us all appreciate the responsibility we share as inheritors of all that is good    and bad    about America.  It’s the American way to blissfully forget history, to think only about tomorrow. But for the slain in Charleston there is no tomorrow. Those of us who are here today must face yesterday squarely, and commit to making a ”new American way ”    of reckoning, reconciliation, and true reconstruction.  Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

[Obeidallah, a former attorney and   comedian, was asked about what the media can to do “  the animosity” in society. He answered:  You see it on Fox News, you see on the Breitbarts out there, really demonizing Muslims, portraying us as threats to America. You have people in the White House now like Steve Bannon and Sebastian Gorka. You had Michael Flynn  —   who is no longer part of the administration, who was on the board of directors for ACT for America, a group the Southern Poverty Law Center calls the biggest   group in America. You have Mike Pompeo, the CIA director, got an award last year from ACT for America. So you have a direct line from the White House to   bigotry. I really hope as a nation we can take a step back and stop   hate. We saw a horrific attack this week on a member of Congress. Other members of Congress could have been hurt.

    "The National Security Agency’s data harvesting program, PRISM, has been the subject of much speculation and controversy since its existence was revealed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2013. [PRISM is widely regarded as “the NSA spying on everyone’s Internet activity” by the public, which is left to guess at the true extent of the program from a few scraps of hard data, since so much of it remains classified.  Recent stories have suggested the scope of NSA surveillance was considerably more narrow than critics feared, but now a ruling from a federal judge suggests that surveillance remains more broad than privacy activists might have hoped.  In essence, the case is about a man arrested on terrorism charges who got caught because the NSA intercepted emails he sent to someone else they had under surveillance. Vocativ describes the defendant as Agron Hasbajrami, an Albanian citizen living in Brooklyn, who was arrested in 2011 and pled guilty to “trying to travel to Pakistan to join a militant jihadi group, as well as to wiring it money. ” After he was arrested, Hasbajrami was told his emails to another individual were swept up by the PRISM program.  He filed a motion to have the evidence against him dismissed, because the warrantless surveillance program violated his reasonable expectation of privacy.  If his motion had succeeded, the New York Law Journal cites his attorneys saying his guilty plea would have been vacated. In a ruling handed down on February 18 but not made public until this week, Federal District Court Judge John Gleeson ruled against Hasbajrami, saying the collection of email evidence against him was “reasonable in light of the Fourth Amendment’s protections. ” The ruling noted that under the relevant law, the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, prosecutors are not required to specify the exact people and places they plan to keep under surveillance when they apply to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. To bring this in line with the earlier NSA Inspector General report which portrayed the electronic surveillance programs more limited than critics believed, the NSA might not be “reading everyone’s email,” but they are allowed to consider all intercepts related to investigations authorized by a FISA court.  Hasbajrami barged into such an investigation with his email, and became fair game. The New York Law Journal notes Judge Gleeson was aware there are few things “more unsettling than the idea of a government spying on its own citizens”and acknowledged there has been “legitimate criticism of electronic surveillance practices,” the action against Hasbajrami was reasonable and consistent with the law. Vocativ notes that Glesson’s ruling provided some of the clearest testimony to date about how the PRISM program works: In PRISM collection, the government identifies the user accounts it wants to monitor and sends a ‘selector’ —  a specific communications facility, such as a target’s email address or telephone number —  to the relevant communications service provider. A government directive then compels the communications service provider to give it communications sent to or from that selector. This type of surveillance, which intercepts ‘ ’ communications, can result in the interception of communications with U. S. persons if the target happens to communicate with such a person. ” This is also consistent with the NSA Inspector General’s report, which said it was   Internet providers sifting through data to locate responsive material, rather than government agents. The Next Web notes this judicial ruling is the first official confirmation that PRISM, which allows the government to collect data directly from the servers of Internet providers, exists as a program distinct from “upstream data collection,” which fishes through data as it flows across the Internet. “The distinction between programs is important as, to date, the NSA has never verified the existence of its PRISM program. Now, it’s undeniable and could lead to more transparent conversations about government surveillance programs, but that’s probably wishful thinking,” The Next Web ventures.": "44033",
    "When Amit Shah, president of Narendra Modi’s ruling party, meets with the Indian prime minister, he is sometimes asked a question he struggles to answer: ”What is behenji thinking?” By ”behenji” or ”older sister” Modi means Mayawati, the enigmatic politician and former ruler of India’s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh. Modi’s keen interest in what the    is up to reflects concern about his political prospects, amid an economic recovery that many poor Indians have yet to feel and rising social tensions among sizeable minority communities. With a   following from tens of millions of people who, like her, belong to the bottom rung of India’s social hierarchy, Mayawati is emerging as Modi’s chief challenger in a key state election set for early next year. ”Mayawati is the biggest threat to our victory,” Sanjeev Balyan, a federal minister in Modi’s government, told Reuters. ”The one who becomes the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh gets to be the most powerful political leader after the prime minister.” Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept Uttar Pradesh, home to 200 million people, in the 2014 general election, handing him the biggest parliamentary majority in three decades. A repeat of that success would help Modi, who remains popular among most Indians, wrest control of the federal parliament’s upper house, making it easier than it has been to pass key reforms. It would also significantly advance his chances of retaining power when India chooses its next prime minister in 2019. But violent attacks on Dalits, as those on the lowest social rung are known, are turning the opinion of some against the BJP and its Hindu nationalist supporters, giving Mayawati a new lease of life as she seeks a political renaissance. (For graphic on India’s electoral map, click  ) WHERE ARE DALIT JOBS? Mayawati is calling on minority groups to reject the BJP, whose roots are in Hindu nationalism that many Dalits and Muslims see as a threat to their way of life. ”Communal forces are becoming stronger,” she told 300, 000 cheering supporters, as she kicked off her election campaign at a sprawling park she built to honor lower caste Indians, previously known as ”untouchables” in Uttar Pradesh’s capital Lucknow. ”I want to ask the prime minister . .. where are the jobs for Dalit boys and girls?” she said. ”He will never understand the problems faced by us.” Speaking on the sidelines of the rally, Mayawati’s Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) general secretary Satish Mishra said Dalits and Muslims ”were totally unsafe” under Modi, a view that reflects Mayawati’s strategy to try and convince the two groups to vote as one. Some lower caste voters deserted her BSP in 2014, allowing the BJP to win 71 out of 80 seats. But a series of attacks on Dalits this year has   Mayawati.   hardline Hindu cow protectors have targeted Dalits and Muslims who make money skinning dead cows, accusing them of killing animals sacred to Hindus. In July, footage emerged of four lower caste men tied to a car, stripped and being flogged in Modi’s home state of Gujarat, triggering violent protests. Dressed in her trademark beige salwar kameez, Mayawati has sped across the country to appear at the side of victims. ”Mayawati has herself a godsend,” said Ramesh Dixit, a former professor of political science at Lucknow University, referring to the attacks. ”  EGOMANIAC” Born into a family of leather workers and raised in a Delhi slum, Mayawati, unmarried and her private life fiercely guarded, lives in a windowless room in a palatial house with   boundary walls and a towering statue of herself in the garden. A ”Dalit Queen” to the millions destined to a life sweeping streets or   under the Hindu caste system that defines people by job, critics have accused her of lavishing money on luxury homes and diamond necklaces while ignoring the poor. During her   term as Uttar Pradesh chief minister, she spent millions of dollars on vast memorial parks with   marble and sandstone statues of elephants, her party symbol, of Dalit icons and of herself   echoing the region’s 19th century Muslim rulers who built monuments to preserve their legacies. A U. S. diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks in 2011 described her as a ”  egomaniac” and she remains unapologetic about her personal extravagance, although officials in her party say she has since reduced the level of public pomp. Mayawati declined requests for an interview.      BJP CHIEF’S 150 VISITS Shah, one of Modi’s most trusted confidants and his chief election strategist, is betting he can expand the BJP’s appeal from its traditional base of prosperous and upper caste voters to less privileged Indians. In the past 24 months, Shah has visited Uttar Pradesh more than 150 times. Mayawati lost power in 2012 to the incumbent socialist regional party that is also expected to put up a tough fight in state elections provisionally scheduled for February. But it is Mayawati whom Modi and Shah fear most, three sources close to the men told Reuters. Dalits account for 22 percent of Uttar Pradesh’s population, and Muslims, many of whom also feel disenfranchised by Modi, the BJP and their conservative Hindu backers, another 19 percent. Modi has condemned the recent attacks, but an influential hardline Hindu organization reminded him that open criticism of cow vigilantes would send the wrong signal to his natural support base. The effort to win over Dalits gets to the heart of the dilemma facing Modi: he must placate wealthier and middle class Hindu voters while appealing to the broader electorate with a vision of a better future. SHARING A MEAL Caste remains a defining feature for people across poor and agrarian Uttar Pradesh, where India’s   economic boom has barely been felt.  No single community is numerous enough to win an election, forcing parties to widen their appeal. Starting with Shah sitting down to share a meal with a Dalit family in May, the BJP has tried to project itself as siding with the poor, even as attacks on marginalized communities capture the headlines. Shah has poached several   leaders from Mayawati and plans to reserve up to half of Uttar Pradesh’s state assembly seats for Dalits, one source close to Shah said. Modi has praised the work of Dalit hero B. R. Ambedkar, and the BJP also wants to mold new icons from that community. At this month’s annual meeting of Hindu nationalist group Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological parent of the BJP which holds considerable sway over the party, the chief guest was a member of the   Dalit street sweeping community. RISING ASPIRATIONS Not everyone from the lower castes is sure of who will best serve them. Fifty kilometres east of Lucknow, in Bedaru, villager Rampyari, illiterate and unsure of her age, is seeing the seeds of change that the BJP hopes will win votes. Upper caste Indians have begun to permit her family to attend the same temple, although not at the same time, while a gas canister will shortly replace her wooden stove under a scheme launched by Modi. Still, her support of Mayawati is unwavering, and upon hearing the name, Rampyari said: ”She has to come back. Dalits feel empowered when she is in power.” But in a central Lucknow slum, Shobha Valmiki makes $25 a month collecting waste, and feels let down by her. ”Nothing has changed,” she said, as goats and donkeys wandered down her   lane. ”They address me as scavenger, not by my own name.”  (Additional reporting by Sharat Pradhan in LUCKNOW; Writing by Tommy Wilkes; Editing by Mike  ) CARACAS   government supporters burst into Venezuela’s   congress on Wednesday, witnesses said, attacking and besieging lawmakers in the latest   of violence during a political crisis.

    "2015’s Baahubali: The Beginning, the impressive first chunk of India’s most expensive film yet, built towards a literal cliffhanger, with a strongman knifed in the back by a trusted associate on the mountain it had taken just shy of three hours to climb. Not untypical of a film hungrily synthesising centuries’ worth of sacred and secular myths, that shock was always going to be tricky to top  —   so it’s a relief to report that The Conclusion opens with a no less jawdropping   between thehero’s mother and a stampeding elephant. Here, once again, is thunderous spectacle unlikely to be surpassed in several summers, and clinching proof of   SS Rajamouli’s position among world cinema’s boldest imagemakers. With quite some explaining to do, The Conclusion’s first half rewinds back into this narrative, dispatching the Herculean Baahu (Prabhas, BeeGeean head of hair  ) to an idyllic neighbouring kingdom for a lesson or two in worldliness. If the first film inclined towards physicality  —   how to get up that mountainside?  —   this second initially steps sideways into more philosophical terrain. The courtly triangleestablished between Baahu, warrior princess Devasena (Anushka Shetty) and   swordsman Kumar Varma (Subba Raju) prompts a few questions about those qualities we look for in our leaders sociologists get some substance to chew between handfuls of popcorn. The action throughout remains joyous. Baahu’s   strength permits the film to take mightily imaginative leaps: one minute our guy’s casually surfing flaming oxen, the next he’s converting himself into a human cannonball with the assistance of a coconut tree. This time, however, we’re more aware of the stakes underpinning such flights of fancy. Rajamouli plots a nimble, broadly progressive path through an especially tangled set of court politics  —   setting Baahu and Deva tododge iron fists and wandering hands alike  —   while alighting upon pleasing grace notes and symmetries: the coda offers a rare convincing demonstration of trickledown economics, even as it returns us to The Beginning. Entirely absent, again, is any cynicism: it’s amazing that a blockbuster with a long   rollcall of “brand partners” should then be permitted to tell a story that could have been filmed in 1917, or 917, if they’d had equipment for a Baahu to lug. This production’s triumph is the room it’s granted Rajamouli to head into the fields and dream up endlessly expressive ways to frame bodies in motion. Of the many sequences here primed to cut through jadedness, perhaps the most wondrous is that which finds Baahu guiding Deva   to shoot three arrows simultaneously  —   a set piece that speaks both to a love of action, and love in action. The budget’s big, the muscle considerable, but they’re nothing compared with Baahubali’s heart.": "148977",
    "When President Donald Trump suggested last month that the reported rise in antisemitism might have been due to hoaxes, the media were outraged. [When Trump rejected  —   angrily  —   the premise of a question posed by a (sympathetic) Jewish reporter who asked Trump what he was going to do about antisemitism, that was treated as evidence of his guilt. And when he condemned antisemitism, it was not enough for Democrats, who are still alleging that he is to blame.  Last week’s arrest of a Jewish teenager in Israel, with dual citizenship in the U. S. proved that much of the antisemitic outbreak was, in fact, fake news. Though there has been a surge in   rhetoric and imagery online, and there has been some vandalism at synagogues and cemeteries, the bomb threats that caused the media sensation were not carried out by white supremacist Trump supporters, but an     journalist and the Israeli teen. Indeed, it is now impossible to know whether the few real incidents of antisemitism were part of a surge, or part of the low level of “background” antisemitism that persists, sadly, even in the U. S. the most tolerant country in the world. Evelyn Gordon of Commentary magazine  —   a publication founded by the American Jewish Committee, with a strong interest in Jewish affairs  —   adds an additional dimension to the story, noting that the teenage culprit was primarily interested in media coverage of the threats. Where the media ignored the bomb threats, he gave up and moved on to other areas where the media reported them, he launched threats against similar targets to amplify the public outrage. Gordon notes that the   reactions of   Jewish institutions and the mainstream media made the outbreak worse: For most of the last two years —  during which he threatened targets like shopping malls and airlines, as well as Jewish institutions in countries like Australia, New Zealand, and America —  his threats produced little media coverage, so he didn’t repeat them. But after Trump’s election, he suddenly hit pay dirt. Threats against U. S. Jewish institutions fit right into the American Jewish community’s loudly proclaimed narrative that the election had empowered     epitomized by   League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt’s ludicrous assertion that U. S.   was now at a level unseen since 1930s Germany. Moreover, such threats fit right into the broader   narrative that Trump’s election had empowered white supremacists, racists and other   hate groups. Consequently, whereas   acts received little media coverage during President Barack Obama’s tenure, they suddenly began receiving massive media attention following Trump’s election —  not just in America, but worldwide. Gordon concludes: “The   hysteria actually encouraged the very attacks it was meant to combat. ” And she makes one additional, crucial point  —   namely, that the threats began under President Barack Obama, but it was President Trump who took them seriously enough to investigate them, and to stop them: The Israeli police sources told Haaretz that even though the bomb threats had gone on for two years and several different countries were involved in the investigation, until recently, capturing the perpetrator wasn’t considered high priority. What changed that, they said, was Donald Trump. A few weeks ago, he ordered the FBI to make nailing the suspect high priority.   …     In short, for all the criticism he justly earned for his belated and reluctant condemnations of   Trump took action to stop it in a way his predecessor never did —  a point to remember for anyone who believes that actions speak louder than words. It is unclear whether the teenager had a political motive. Regardless, Trump has been vindicated. He is owed several apologies  —   and, more than that, he deserves to be commended. Joel B.

    "Crude prices were slightly lower after a volatile session on Thursday, as the restart of two key Libyan oilfields and concerns about lackluster gasoline demand fed concern over whether major oil producers can alleviate the glut of global inventories. Libya’s Sharara and El Feel oilfields, which can produce nearly 400, 000 barrels per day (bpd) returned to production after protests blocking pipelines ended. U. S. gasoline futures led the energy complex lower in choppy trading, at one point hitting its lowest level seasonally in eight years after data on Wednesday showed inventories rose by the most in nearly three months. Brent crude LCOc1 settled down 14 cents a barrel at $51. 68. U. S. light crude CLc1 was down 37 cents to $49. 25 a barrel. “Gasoline is kind of keeping crude from going up very much,” said James Williams, president of energy consultant WTRG Economics in London, Arkansas. U. S. gasoline RBc1 tumbled almost 2 percent to $1. 559 a gallon.  ”Gasoline is leading the way lower with ample stocks, lower demand compared to last year, and an increase in gas( oline) stocks on the east coast,” said Anthony Headrick of CHS Hedging. “For the last four weeks gas demand is down 1. 8 percent from last year. ”  Global crude oil inventories have remained high, in part because of increased production from the United States. At 9. 27 million bpd it is at its highest since August 2015, according to government data.  Amid concerns about the persistent global oil glut the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia are in talks to extend a   deal to cut 1. 8 million bpd into the second half of the year. OPEC   Mohammad Barkindo said although the oil oversupply was declining, stocks needed to fall further, in comments that pointed to an extension in cuts. Barkindo did not comment directly on whether the cut would be extended, but he said efforts were under way led by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid   who is OPEC president in 2017, to get a consensus before ministers meet in Vienna on May 25.

S. elections and any collusion with the Trump campaign. According to the Independent Journal Review: “I believe it hurts the country terribly because it shows we’re a divided,     country,” he said, according to CNN. “And we have very important things to do right now,” he added, citing trade deals, military issues, and the spread of nuclear weapons. “It also happens to be a pure excuse for the Democrats having lost an election that they should have easily won because of the Electoral College being slated so much in their way,” he said. “That’s all this is. I think it shows division, and it shows that we’re not together as a country. And I think it’s a very, very negative thing. ” Trump closed his comments by stating that “hopefully, this can go quickly, because we have to show unity if we’re going to do great things with respect to the rest of the world. ” This is the second time Trump has met with TV news anchors privately. The first time was before his address to a joint session of Congress. Pelley reportedly moved the CBS evening news show from New York to Washington partly as a result of the lunch.

    "(Corrects to ”one member” from ”two members” in paragraph 10) By Sudarshan Varadhan Shares of the biggest U. S. commercial insurer by premiums fell 3. 3 percent in extended trading on Monday. AIG has been scaling back investments in hedge funds, which have borne the brunt of excessive market volatility in the past year.    hedge funds favored by pension funds and the   for their track record of stellar returns took a battering in the first quarter of 2016, with some posting their worst ever start to a year on record. AIG’s weak results come at a time when the company is facing the possibility of having to set aside more capital as regulators worry about financial firms deemed ”too big to fail”. The insurer’s near collapse in 2008 and its $182 billion bailout by the U. S. government led to its inclusion in the Federal Reserve’s list of ”systemically important financial institutions” (SIFIs). Chief Executive Peter Hancock said in March that a judge’s ruling that MetLife Inc ( ) was not ”too big to fail” opened up an opportunity for AIG to seek an exemption from the designation. Investors will look for an update on AIG’s position when the company holds its   call on Tuesday. AIG has been under pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn to split into three independent companies.  In February, the insurer agreed to add one member nominated by Icahn to its board. Samuel Merksamer, a managing director at Icahn Capital LP, and billionaire investor John Paulson are expected to join AIG’s board next week. The operating profit attributable to AIG fell 54 percent to $773 million in the first quarter, partly due to restructuring costs of $122 million. On a   basis, AIG earned 65 cents, far short of the average analyst estimate of $1. 00, according to Thomson Reuters    .   income in AIG’s commercial property and casualty insurance business, its biggest, fell 38. 5 percent to $720 million. The unit’s net investment income fell about 44 percent to $577 million. Shares of AIG, which traces its roots to a   office in Shanghai in 1919, were trading at $54. 75 after the bell.

    "In the last installment, we examined some positive historical precedents for a new president’s foreign policy.  In this installment, we will consider positive precedents for a new president’s domestic policy. [Next in a series,    1.  The Democrats’ Struggle to Remember Their Roots  For the Forgotten Man, and the Forgotten Woman, it’s nice to be remembered.  During the campaign, Donald Trump revived the phrase, “Forgotten Man,” which echoes back to the Depression years of the 1930s. Specifically, it harkens to Franklin D. Roosevelt, the great   champion of   Americans. As FDR said during the 1932 presidential campaign, while challenging incumbent Herbert Hoover —  who had presided over an   increase in unemployment during his single miserable term —  the crisis of the age was akin to 1917, when the US was forced to enter World War One: These unhappy times call for the building of plans that rest upon the forgotten, the unorganized but indispensable units of economic power for plans like those of 1917 that build from the bottom up and not from the top down, that put their faith once more in the forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid.  [emphasis added] The American people appreciated FDR’s sense of urgency, which stood in stark contrast with Hoover’s        .  So in November 1932, FDR won a massive victory, carrying 42 of 48 states.  Thus we can see: The Forgotten People didn’t like being forgotten, and they were grateful to the candidate who cared about them.  Eight decades later, we were reminded of this same point: During the campaign, Donald Trump had plenty to say about the economy, and his message most hit home in the forgotten areas of the country.  For example, on October 21, in   Johnstown, PA, Trump said: Your government betrayed you, and I’m going to make it right.  Your jobs will come back under a Trump administration.  Your steel will come back. We’re putting your miners back to work.  In addition, Trump was respectful to, and attentive of, the industrial heritage of the region:  The iron and steel forged in your mills formed the backbone of our nation.  . . . This was the town that people flocked to from around the world to make their American Dreams come true. And so on Election Night, the victorious Trump, having Pennsylvania and other afflicted states, emphatically revived the Rooseveltian trope of yore, proclaiming, “The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. ” Remember my forgotten manYou put a rifle in his handYou sent him far awayYou shouted: “ ! ”But look at him today, Yes, it’s sad that the folks who have played by the rules, paid their taxes, and fought in the wars were forgotten —  as the forces of globalism, mostly cheered by the elites of both parties —  took their terrible toll. Then came Trump.   As we all know, he talked a different language, with a different set of issues, than the other 16 Republicans in the presidential race —  and he was richly rewarded.  And then came Trump vs. Clinton.    Hillary, Obama’s anointed successor, ran a campaign that could only be described as snobbish, curiously hostile to “deplorable” Middle America.  In the tart words of liberal novelist Mark Lilla, she thought she could win by ignoring America as a whole, and instead   favored blocs:  She tended on the campaign trail to lose that large vision and slip into the rhetoric of diversity, calling out explicitly to   Latino, LGBT and women voters at every stop. This was a strategic mistake.  If you are going to mention groups in America, you had better mention all of them.  If you don’t, those left out will notice and feel excluded.  Which, as the data show, was exactly what happened with the white working class and those with strong religious convictions.  Fully   of white voters without college degrees voted for Donald Trump, as did over 80 percent of white evangelicals. Indeed, the whole 2016 election can be seen as a battle between   insiders and   outsiders.  In the   words of Peggy Noonan, the voting was reflective of the distinction between the “protected” and the “unprotected”:  The unprotected people of America, who have to live with Washington’s policies, rebelled against the protected, who make and defend those policies and who care little if at all about the unprotected.  That broke bonds of loyalty and allegiance.  Tuesday was in effect an uprising of the unprotected.  It was part of the   against detached elites that is sweeping the West and was seen most recently in the Brexit vote. Hence the November 18 headline in Politico: “House Democrats lament     Some fear that the party’s move toward urban and suburban voters will eventually shut Democrats out of former white   strongholds. ”  In the words of Rep. Collin Peterson ( .) an increasingly lonely rural Democrat, “We’ve become an urban party. ” Indeed, for Democrats, a grimmer, and more realistic, mood seems to be settling in about not only geography, but also, ideology.  Thus this November 20 headline, also in Politico: “How the Left Created Trump: Nov. 8 represented an explosion of anger on the right at years of smugness and disdain by liberals. ”  In the words of writer Rob Hoffman:  As a bemused aside: Wasn’t it just yesterday that the Democrats, and their handmaidens in the MSM, were telling Republicans that they were doomed if they didn’t embrace multiculturalism and “comprehensive immigration reform”?  Yet as always, as James Carville famously said, “It’s the economy, stupid. ”  And so where were the Democrats on that issue?  Here’s where they were this year: busy dreaming up schemes to decrease growth.": "40382",
    "For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.             Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, During Sunday night’s debate, Donald Trump told Hillary Clinton that, “if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your [email] situation. ” That would constitute an abuse of power. Presidents are not supposed to “instruct” their attorneys general to appoint a “special prosecutor” (now called an “independent counsel. ”) The attorney general is supposed to make that decision apolitically, based on her judgment of whether the Justice Department can impartially investigate the case. By pledging that she would follow the advice of the FBI investigators looking into Clinton’s email controversy, Lynch tried to disentangle legal considerations from partisan ones. By promising that he will “instruct” his attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor, Trump is pledging exactly the opposite. Why Debate Night Won’t End Trump’s Nightmare, But Trump didn’t stop there. He not only said he would make his attorney general appoint an independent counsel, he also vowed to determine the outcome of that counsel’s investigation. If he becomes president, Trump declared, Clinton will “be in jail. ” Under the Constitution, presidents don’t decide who goes to jail. (Except insofar as they have the power to pardon). Courts decide who goes to jail based on their assessment of whether someone broke the law. But Trump’s indifference to the limits on presidential power last night wasn’t surprising. He’s been advertising it since he entered the race. Last September, after National Review editor Rich Lowry said that Carly Fiorina had “cut his balls off with the precision of a surgeon” at a GOP primary debate, Trump tweeted that Lowry “should not be allowed on TV and the FCC should fine him!” Legally, there’s a debate about whether the FCC can fine broadcasters for obscene or indecent behavior. But even if it can, the Commission is supposed to do so based on objective, apolitical criteria. Trump, by contrast, was proposing to use the obscenity laws to silence his critics in the press. Doing so would transform the FCC in the same way Trump last night proposed to transform the independent counsel: from an institution tasked with impartially interpreting the law into a weapon to be used against Trump’s political adversaries. For Trump, this has been a theme. In May, angered by the “ridiculous questions” that Washington Post reporters were asking him, Trump warned that owner Jeff Bezos “is getting away with murder,  ” and “we can’t let him get away with it. ” In February, he warned that “if I become president,” Bezos and the Post are “going to have such problems. ” Put aside the irony of Trump fuming about a billionaire who is “getting away with murder,  . ” If Bezos and his company, Amazon, really aren’t paying the taxes they owe, that’s a matter for the IRS and the career prosecutors at the Department of Justice. They’re supposed to be guided by legal precedent. Trump, by contrast wants turn them —  along with the independent counsel and FCC —  into vehicles for retaliation against his critics and foes. He leveled the same threat against Gonzalo Curiel, the San Diego judge presiding over the lawsuit against Trump University. “They ought to look into Judge Curiel, because what Judge Curiel is doing is a total disgrace,” Trump declared. It’s not clear who Trump means by “they. ” There are procedures for accusing a judge of misconduct. But for a president to use those procedures to retaliate against a judge who is ruling against his financial interests would threaten the independence of the judiciary. But the very notion that there are government agencies that operate independently of presidential whim seems alien to Trump. In September, without evidence, he accused Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen of keeping interest rates low at President Obama’s instruction, even though the entire point of the Federal Reserve is to insulate monetary policy from White House meddling. In March, Trump vowed that in fighting terrorists, he’d order the U. S. military to “take out their families. ” But the military is supposed to follow the law. And the Geneva Convention, ratified by the Senate, prohibits targeting noncombatants. Nonetheless, when asked what he’d do if officers refused to carry out his illegal orders, Trump declared, “They won’t refuse. They’re not gonna refuse me. ” In September, Trump pledged that, once elected, he’d install “different generals. ” As Brian Palmer noted in Slate, that too runs afoul of our system of government. A president can recall generals from their individual commands. But he can’t simply fire them. “The president is the commander in chief of the armed forces,” Palmer explained, “not the CEO. ” Perhaps Trump’s unfettered vision of executive power stems from his particular experience as a CEO. After all, he hasn’t respected legal boundaries in that role either. Instead of keeping his charity and his   businesses separate, he’s used the former to pay the latter’s legal bills. But when CEOs don’t respect the legal limits of their power, it’s not that big a problem. It’s not that big a problem because CEOs must yield to judges because judges are agents of the state. And, at the end of the day, the state controls the guns. When a president doesn’t respect the law, it’s much dicier. By law, presidents are subject to judges too. If judges rule that a president has overstepped his legal authority they can order him to stop. The problem is that the president, unlike the CEO, can refuse to comply because he controls the guns. Or, he may control them. America has generally been spared constitutional crises that force the military to choose sides. In the course of such crises, liberal democracies often die.   What is the risk that a Trump presidency would spark such a crisis? There’s no way to quantify it. But with confidence, we can say this: It is higher than the risk posed by any other presidential candidate in modern American history. After all, even Richard Nixon, when threatened with impeachment, resigned. Republicans often say one of history’s lessons is that when a leader says he wants to kill you, you should believe him. By that logic, when a   leader says he wants to transgress the Constitution, you should believe him, too. Trump has vowed to do so many times. He did again last night. Yet most Republican politicians still look away.": "80946",
    "Kenyon Martin isn’t shy about voicing his opinion, as we learned after recent comments from his former Denver Nuggets coach George Karl.

Martin explained most actual NBA fights don’t happen when the cameras are on. It’s too easy to act tough during a game when you know someone will break things up before real punches are thrown. NBA practices are where you’ll see the most intense altercations. Martin: I’ve seen fights, been a part of fights in practice, fights in the locker room after the game.   …     My rookie year, I saw Kendall Gill choke out Jim McIlvaine in practice. Choked him out in practice one day. Jim McIlvaine was wild. He elbowed him one day in practice, elbowed him a couple times, and Kendall got fed up. Grabbed him, put him to the ground, man, and choked him, like, “I’ll kill you!” Other than myself, Nene grabbed Steve Blake by his throat one day at practice.   …     Grabbed this man by his throat and picked him up. Nene’s got them big ol’ hands, man. Picked that man up. Steve Blake was punching him. Broussard: I mean, you knocked out Nene.

He was staying away from me. And the days I wouldn’t come to the gym or I wouldn’t play, he would play. So you know me and my thought process, like, “You’re avoiding me. ” So I come to the gym late one day, and he’s playing. All right, let me guard him. I guard him, we’re going back and forth. We ain’t really playing basketball, it’s kind of getting a little chippy. Physical, I don’t mind. But I stopped play a few times, “Listen, Nene, you’re not playing basketball.

    "As soon as Donald Trump was sworn in as president, the official White House website  —   WhiteHouse. gov  —   got a speedy makeover to reflect the change in administration, as had long been planned.    Gone is the Obama White House’s page on climate change, which is now archived here for posterity (along with virtually everything else from the   website). That page had talked about how global warming was a serious threat to future generations, optimistically touted America’s ability to tackle the problem, and listed dozens of actions the Obama administration has taken to reduce carbon dioxide emissions:         Instead, the Trump administration has a page promising “An America First Energy Plan” that makes no mention at all of global warming  —   except to note that Trump plans to eliminate many of Obama’s climate policies. (In fact, there are no mentions of climate change anywhere on Trump’s WhiteHouse. gov.) As the new site notes, Trump plans to push for more drilling of America’s “estimated $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil, and natural gas reserves, especially those on federal lands. ”         It’s a stark reminder of just how much energy and environmental policy change is coming this year  —   and fast.

    "Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta mocked her tendency to laugh loudly at inappropriate times in another embarrassing snit between top Democrats, leaked emails reveal.

    "For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.             Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, On many subjects, Donald Trump has given no indication of what he’d do if elected, but he has fleshed out at least two specific elements of his domestic agenda: The press has yet to clarify what this would mean in practice. To make good on these pledges to stop and frisk millions of black people and to round up and deport millions of Hispanics who are in the U. S. without permission, Trump would have to transform America into something so like a police state that it should scare even those who abhor crime and favor many deportations. Frisking Innocent Black Bodies, In New York City, where Michael Bloomberg presided over most Stop and Frisk policing, the approach involved 4. 4 million stops —  that is to say, armed agents of the state forced New Yorkers to stop on the street 4. 4 million times between 2002 and 2015. And 88 percent of those stops resulted in no further action! Put another way, millions who did nothing wrong were needlessly stopped and harassed by police. It could not be more plain that huge numbers of them, the vast majority of whom were black and brown, gave no probable cause to justify a search. As the New York Times reported in August 2013, Stop and Frisk did not just harass masses of innocents, it violated their constitutional rights: Federal Judge Shira Scheindlin “concluded that the stops, which soared in number over the last decade as crime continued to decline, demonstrated a widespread disregard for the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures by the government, as well as the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause. ” Trump proposes to impose Stop and Frisk upon communities nationwide —  he evidently has as little regard for the Tenth Amendment as he does for the Fourth and Fourteenth. This would be a   nightmare of epic proportions.   Rounding Up and Deport Millions, Unlike deporting unauthorized immigrants who have served time for crimes rather than releasing them back into American communities, or greater enforcement against businesses that hire undocumented labor, the approach of rounding up and deporting many millions more people would require a massive force of armed agents roaming American communities, and would inevitably affect a large number of Hispanics who are legal citizens. Many legal residents will suffer harassment, as happened in Maricopa County, Arizona, under Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a perpetrator of racial profiling and an ally of Trump. Tens of thousands of new state agents would be required to carry out such roundups. What percentage of Trump’s newly hired roundup force would be hostile to Hispanics? Would they be armed? How would they be trained? Would they be about as competent at their jobs as TSA agents? Would they knock on doors of Hispanic family homes? Burst into small businesses of people who “look illegal”? How many Americans would be forced to “show their papers” like bygone East Germans? Would the    start demanding birth certificates? This, too, would be a civil liberties nightmare.   Violations, Donald Trump has a lot of proposals that are constitutionally and logistically suspect. It’s possible that he would never succeed in implementing some of them. But if he does what he says, Trump’s domestic policy would be the worst Republicans have offered blacks and Hispanics since Nixon or even Eisenhower. Millions of innocent,   blacks and Hispanics would have their rights violated. Review what Trump is offering by his own account:    for black people, and aggressive roundups of millions of Hispanics. And we haven’t even talked about the many reasons that   Muslims have to fear a Trump presidency. In past elections, Republicans have complained with some justice that Democrats cry wolf about racism. Now the GOP has gone and nominated the wolf.": "80602",
    "Maine Democratic elector David Bright announced Monday morning that he would vote for Senator Bernie Sanders in the Electoral College. He told the Portland   that his vote would send a meaningful message to the thousands of new voters who enrolled as Democrats to support Sanders. Is it the job of an elector to send a reassuring or encouraging message to discouraged activists? More than 354, 000 Maine voters cast ballots for Hillary Clinton, with the full expectation that Democratic electors would give her their votes if she won the state and its electoral districts. Don’t they deserve some encouragement, too? Just what kind of a message will they hear when they learn that Bright decided to ignore their ballots and vote for Sanders? As Samuel Goldwyn said, “If you have a message, call Western Union. ” The Constitution and federal law give the states a lot of latitude on selecting electors. But there’s a reason those electors who violate their pledge are called “faithless,” their names and number recorded in history: The system works only if voters have confidence that their ballots will matter, and voters can have confidence that their ballots will matter only if electors remain faithful. The prospect of a Trump presidency has triggered other electors to violate their pledges, or contemplate doing so, as well. Two of Satiacum’s fellow Washington Democratic electors, Bret Chiafalo and Levi Guerra, announced an interest in voting for a Republican alternative to Trump. Three Democratic electors in Colorado filed an emergency request to suspend a state law that requires electors to vote for the candidate who won the state. A federal appeals court denied the request. (One of the great ironies of the brouhaha about “faithless electors” this year is that Hillary Clinton may lose more votes than Trump does more Democratic electors than Republican ones have expressed a public interest in voting for someone besides her.) For the last week, American politics has been entirely preoccupied with the apparent fact that Russian hackers, under orders from the Kremlin, engaged in a criminal campaign to undermine public faith in America’s system of elections and possibly to help Trump win the White House. Just what will happen when those such as Sanders and Kasich, who didn’t win their parties’ nominations and weren’t even on the ballot, get electoral votes because they’re more appealing to individual electors? How much faith do   Maine Democrats have in the system right now? Our elections run on trust. These faithless electors have publicly pledged to support a nominee and in some cases signed written pledges. Once the election results were in and it was too late for them to be removed from their positions as electors, they announced that they intended to vote for someone different. If this phenomenon becomes more common every four years, people will justifiably ask whether their vote matters at all. There will be efforts to increase the punishment of faithless electors, but that’s an    consequence unlikely to deter someone sufficiently narcissistic that he takes relish in ignoring the will of their states’ voters. Can we imagine a scenario in which a   proves so spectacularly unqualified and dangerous to the Republic that the electors need to save the American electorate from its own bad judgment? Sure. But that sort of extraordinary measure ought to be reserved for extraordinary circumstances, not just a temper tantrum over the Clinton campaign’s hubris that the upper Midwest was solidly blue. Our system of democracy offers almost unlimited opportunities to speak one’s mind and “send a message. ” Why must these electors turn the Electoral College process into one more soapbox? More Electoral CollegeAmerica’s CollegeWhat Trump calls Schumer, c. The Culinary CultMany Democrats have grumbled about the Electoral College ever since the 2000 election but lament that passing a constitutional amendment is just too hard. This year’s faithless electors may do some of the heavy lifting for them. Voters won’t long tolerate a system in which   efforts to win the most votes in a state are undone retroactively because unknown party activists have a personal change of heart or want to send a message. The Electoral College is a wise concept, designed to ensure that each state has value in the election and save the country from the nightmare scenario of a   margin triggering a nationwide recount. But it works only if everyone involved acts with integrity, including the electors. It’s easier to trust 538 fellow citizens if they keep their word or resign when they feel they cannot keep it in good conscience, as one   Texas elector did. But if enough members of that group of 538 are narcissists who get a thrill from defying the public’s will, public faith in American elections will crumble, and it won’t be the fault of Vladimir Putin’s thugs.,": "122138",
    "On Thursday’s Breitbart News Daily, SiriusXM host Alex Marlow asked Breitbart News Senior Editor at Large Peter Schweizer about allegations that Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign chairman, John Podesta, may have violated federal law through his dealings with the Russians. [Schweizer said Podesta has “a very interesting relationship with Russia, going back to when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. ”  “When she was secretary of state, he was an adviser. He sat on her foreign policy advisory board. We know from the Podesta emails that he was talking to her all the time on everything from speeches to personnel decisions to policy positions,” Schweizer elaborated. “In 2011, he joins the executive board of this small energy company in Massachusetts called Joule Energy,” Schweizer recalled. “And Joule Energy, about two months after he joins the executive board, gets a large infusion of cash. They get one billion rubles, which is about $35 to $45 million, invested from Russia. It comes from a very unusual entity, this entity called RUSNANO. ”  “RUSNANO is this   investment fund, called ‘Putin’s Child’ by the Russian Science Ministry, so it shows you how connected this fund is,” he explained. “They actually buy an equity stake in this John   company, which they can do. You can raise the question of why they’re doing it while he’s advising Hillary Clinton, but they can legally do that. ” “The problem for Podesta becomes when he joins the Obama White House as counselor to the president in 2013,” he continued. “In order to do that, he’s got to file those large, cumbersome, but I think essential financial disclosure forms where you list what boards are you on, that you are connected to or have been connected to in the last year, what entities. You’re also required to disclose your stock holdings. ”  “In the case of Podesta, there are two omissions. One of them is the way the Joule was structured, it has three corporate boards. It has one based in Massachusetts, one based in the Netherlands, and then it has a holding company. John Podesta, according to corporate records, was on all three of those boards. He only listed two of them on his financial disclosure. He omitted probably the most important one, which was the holding company,” said Schweizer. “Now, you could say okay, maybe it was just an omission. He listed two of the three that’s not bad,” he granted. “The problem is that he failed to disclose what he did with the 75, 000 shares of stock that he had in the company that were given to him as a board member. He gave them to his daughter through an LLC. ” “There’s a question of whether she actually owned them  —   and by that I mean the Podesta emails show that he had a   email conversation with Joule Energy executives and people connected with them, even though he ostensibly didn’t own stock anymore. But he failed to disclose that transaction. He failed to disclose the 75, 000 shares he owned that he gave to his daughter. That is a direct, clear violation of what you are supposed to disclose on these federal forms,” Schweizer said. Marlow noted there have been “zero pieces of hard evidence connecting the Trump campaign to the Russian government,” while “there is so much evidence, much of it uncovered by you, connecting the Clintons with the Russian government. ”  “And yet, the media is obsessed with one and not the other,” he said. Schweizer found the disparity of coverage interesting as well. “I’m a big believer that you need to investigate and look into things, particularly if you’re talking about foreign governments or foreign entities trying to influence our politicians,” he declared. “What we know right now about the Russia story as it relates to Trump is the relationship, as it were, amounts to meetings that some Trump officials had with people from Russia. Those Trump officials never really made it into the Trump administration  —   with the exception of Michael Flynn, who left pretty quickly,” he pointed out.  “The thesis that everybody is operating on is the Russians helped Trump win and Trump is going to do all these favors for Russia. The problem is, when you look at the personnel decisions, who’s running Russia policy in the United States  —   whether that’s General Mattis at the Pentagon, whether that is McMaster, the national security adviser, whether that’s the CIA director, whether that’s the director of Russia policy on the National Security Council, who’s a very solid scholar from the Brookings Institution  —   none of these are remotely ” he said.  “All you have is sort of this concern that the Russians were hacking during the election, which I think is a legitimate concern and a theory that hasn’t been proved, that there was a connection between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. There’s just been no evidence of that,” he noted.  “My point is both should be looked into, but you actually have very substantial things that went on when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, that, number one, included the transfer of money to the Clintons and to John Podesta and number two, very serious favors done by the Hillary Clinton State Department to the Russians, including technology transfer, et cetera,” he said.  “The kind of scenario that people envision happened with Trump happened in the Clinton State Department. And yet, there seems to be a lack of interest in pursuing and investigating precisely what those relationships were and how everything was carried out,” Schweizer observed.

    "Donald Trump has already committed a grave offense against our system of government by forming a “junta,” according to his critics. The Trump junta consists of three former generals whom the   has tapped for top   positions, with others still under consideration. Like much of what Trump does, the military selections have inflamed people who pride themselves on their knowledge and discernment into flights of   outrage. Namely, Trump didn’t seize the government by force he himself is not a general (although he went to the New York Military Academy for high school) and the three generals he has tapped for top posts are all retired and therefore civilians. (Michael Flynn will be   adviser, and Trump has nominated James Mattis as defense secretary, and John Kelly as   secretary.) The Trump cabinet, in other words, bears about as much resemblance to a junta as the Supreme Court does to the College of Cardinals because it has five justices who are Catholic and wear robes. To call the connection superficial is to understate how absurdly inapposite it is. If the presence of three retired military leaders is enough to tip an otherwise     government into   rule, we already experienced it at the outset of the Obama administration. As the Washington Examiner pointed out, President Barack Obama had three military leaders as part of his initial team, a retired Marine general (Jim Jones as   adviser) an Army general (Eric Shinseki at Veterans Affairs) and a Navy admiral (Dennis Blair as director of national intelligence). The republic survived. Worse, the United States has repeatedly had retired generals not merely as cabinet secretaries, but as commanders in chief  —   from George Washington, to Andrew Jackson, to U. S. Grant, to Dwight Eisenhower. No one seriously considered their presidencies affronts to the principle of civilian rule. None of this will dissuade the journalists and analysts who have been throwing around the “junta” charge, though. Much of the Left and the press has taken Trump’s election as a license to suspend rational thought. They like the delegitimizing sound of the word “junta,” and that’s enough for them to use it, never mind that it renders the term meaningless. The fact is that Trump is a civilian leader who is impressed by people who once served at the top levels of the military. This is understandable, given how the stereotype of the general as the thoughtless,   warmonger is  —   if it ever applied  —   less relevant than ever. The best generals are worldly, capable, and tend to be realistic about the limits of military power. Despite the nickname “mad dog”  —   which he dislikes  —   Gen. James Mattis is hardly Gen. Curtis LeMay, the   Air Force general who notoriously talked of bombing the North Vietnamese “back into the Stone Age” during the Vietnam War. Mattis is noted for his bookishness and traveling with a   library.

They are more likely to be restraining influences rather than enablers. Trump has credited Mattis with changing his view of waterboarding, which Trump casually endorsed throughout the election campaign. If there are legitimate worries about how Trump will govern, the alleged junta is more of a commentary on his detractors than on his cabinet choices. But don’t worry. As soon as this charge is dropped, another equally    one will take its place, in this, the season of the Left losing its mind.,": "122063",
    "Long dark highways and thin white lines fire roads and Interstates the skeleton frames of   Chevrolets barefoot girls sitting on the hoods of Dodges pink Cadillacs   power drives men who go out for a ride and never come back. Bruce Springsteen’s song lyrics have injected more drama and mystery into the myths of the American road than any figure since Jack Kerouac. He knows this, of course. So it’s one of the running jokes in his big, loose, rangy and intensely satisfying new memoir, “Born to Run” (what else was he going to call it?) that he didn’t begin to drive until he was well into his 20s  —   around the time he landed simultaneously on the covers of Time and Newsweek. His brooding and violent father had been too impatient to teach him and, anyway, he couldn’t afford a car. When Mr. Springsteen was forced to sneak behind the wheel, licenseless, to handle some of the driving on his earliest tours, his ineptitude terrified his band members. He did not exactly, when young and virile, ride through mansions of glory on suicide machines. He mostly stuck out his thumb. He’d been born to hitch. “Every sort of rube, redneck, responsible citizen and   the Jersey Shore had to offer, I rode with ’em,” he writes in “Born to Run. ” These rides matter because Mr. Springsteen’s songs, like the   poems of Philip Levine, are intensely peopled. Wild Billy and Crazy Janey, Johnny 99, Mary from “Thunder Road,” Wayne from “Darlington County,” Jimmy the Saint and Bobby Jean had to come from somewhere. This memoir suggests Mr. Springsteen met many of them while cackling over there in the shotgun seat. The headline news in “Born to Run,” to judge by the early news media tweets, is that Mr. Springsteen, who turns 67 on Friday, has suffered periodically from serious depression. I will admit that this information shook me. If Bruce Springsteen has to resort to Klonopin, what hope is there for anyone? But these sections are not the reason to come to “Born to Run. ” The book is like one of Mr. Springsteen’s shows  —   long, ecstatic, exhausting, filled with peaks and valleys. It’s part séance and part keg party, and then the house lights come up and you realize that, A) you look ridiculous dancing to “Twist and Shout” and, B) you will be driving home in a minivan and not a Camaro. His writing voice is much like his speaking voice there’s a big, raspy laugh on at least every other page. There’s some raunch here. This book has not been utterly sanitized for anyone’s protection, and many of the best lines won’t be printed in this newspaper. Most important, “Born to Run” is, like his finest songs, closely observed from end to end. His story is intimate and personal, but he has an interest in other people and a gift for sizing them up. Here’s just one example, chosen nearly at random. When Mr. Springsteen meets a future girlfriend on the boardwalk in Asbury Park, N. J. (one of innumerable girlfriends on display here) he delivers this electric introduction: “She was Italian, funny, a beatific tomboy, with just the hint of a lazy eye, and wore a pair of glasses that made me think of the wonders of the library. ” Well, hello, you think. Much of the writing in “Born to Run” is this fresh  —   the sound of a writer who could have phoned his book in but did not. There are dollops of pretension and   in “Born to Run. ” Springsteen wouldn’t be Springsteen without homilies, a few of them leaden, about fathers and sons and love and work and community. But this book mostly gets away clean, leaving behind the scent of lightly scorched rubber. Mr. Springsteen’s father was a frequently unemployed bus driver, among other   jobs his mother a legal secretary. They were fairly poor. In their houses  —     more often  —   there was generally no telephone and little heat. Meals were cooked on a coal stove. “Born to Run” is potent on the subject of social class. In Mr. Springsteen’s part of New Jersey it was the “ ” (preppies) versus the greasers, and there was no doubt which side of that line he was on. At some of his early shows, guys in chinos spat on him. “I could still feel the shadow of that spit that hit me long ago when I moved to Rumson in 1983, 16 years later,” he writes. He’d found fame and bought a decent place. Yet: “At 33 years old, I still had to take a big gulp of air before walking through the door of my new home. ” He suggests there’s a freight of psychic payback in “Darkness on the Edge of Town,” his most fully realized album. “For my parents’ troubled lives I was determined to be the enlightened, compassionate voice of reason and revenge. ” Mr. Springsteen got his first guitar, a rental, after seeing Elvis on “The Ed Sullivan Show. ” He had a serious work ethic, and went on to play in a string of   bands with names like Child and Earth and Steel Mill. When his   first record, “Greetings From Asbury Park, N. J.,” appeared in 1973, he was lumped with the   New Dylans, folk singers like Loudon Wainwright III and John Prine. But there was a crucial difference. Unlike those performers, Mr. Springsteen onstage, thanks to his long   apprenticeship, could blow audiences backward. Mr. Springsteen writes that he’s never thought much of his singing voice. As good a guitar player as he is, others were better. It was his songs, he realized early, that would have to put him over the top. If this book has one curious blind spot, it’s that we never quite understand how those words came into being. He studied the songwriting of people like Mr. Dylan, Donovan and Tim Buckley, he writes. But so did many others. If his early reading was an influence, he doesn’t say. The words were apparently just there, available, on tap. And they stayed there, even when his lyrics became pared down. Songs like “The River” and “Stolen Car” are as evocative in their details as are Raymond Carver’s best short stories. “Born to Run” takes us, album by album, through his career. These chapters sometimes feel clipped and compressed, as if he’s wedged the data in his heart onto a thumb drive. The book takes us through his many stabs at romance, which tended to end badly. (He once gave his father the crabs after they’d shared a toilet seat.) He details the failure of his first marriage, to the actress Julianne Phillips, and the success of his second, to Patti Scialfa, whom he describes, in a childhood photo, as “a   Raggedy Ann of a little girl. ” He raised his three children without   mementos in the house. “My kids didn’t know ‘Badlands’ from matzo ball soup,” he writes. “When I was approached on the street for autographs, I’d explain to them that in my job I was Barney (the   purple dinosaur) for adults. ” His eldest son says, in shock, “Dad, that guy has you tattooed on his arm. ” Mr. Springsteen’s work ethic has never abandoned him, or he it. “I’m glad I’ve been handsomely paid for my efforts,” he writes, “but I truly would have done it for free. ”": "21780",
    "Donald Trump, who takes the oath of office in just 15 days, has been publicly smearing the integrity and legitimacy of the US intelligence community on Twitter  —   disputing their assessment that Russia tried to influence the US election and mocking their erroneous   War assertion that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction.     Today, the intelligence community  —   and their supporters in Congress  —   fired back.  In a fiery Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on foreign cyber threats to the United States, the country’s top spies  —   along with several senators from both parties  —   lambasted what Director of National Intelligence James Clapper described as Trump’s ”disparagement” of the intelligence community. “Mr  : When you listen to these people, they’re the best among us and they’re trying to protect us,” declared Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham.     Clapper and others at the hearing also warned of the potential damage Trump’s comments could do to the nation’s ability to work with other nations to confront security threats like ISIS and the continued threat of radical Islamist terror.    “I have received many expressions of concern from foreign counterparts of what has been interpreted as the disparagement of the intelligence community,” said Clapper.   In response to a question from Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich about how the  ’s “dismissive attitude towards the intelligence community” was impacting morale in the intelligence agencies, Clapper tersely stated, “I haven’t done a climate survey, but I hardly think it helps it. ”    Admiral Mike Rogers, commander of the US Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency, went further, expressing his concern that damage to the morale of the intelligence community’s professional workforce could potentially lead to the departures of key personnel. “What we do is in no small part driven in part by the confidence of our leaders in what we do,” said Rogers. “And without that confidence, I just don’t want a situation where our workforce decides to walk. ” Although Rogers himself didn’t mention Trump by name, his comment was striking because he has been rumored to be under consideration to replace Clapper and become the incoming Trump administration’s top spy.    For someone whose signature campaign promise was to “Make America Great Again,” publicly trashing one of the fundamental pillars of the country’s national security apparatus seems an odd way to go about restoring the country’s greatness in the eyes of the world.  What the fight is all about The intelligence community  —   including the CIA, the FBI, the director of National Intelligence, and the Department of Homeland Security  —   has stated unequivocally that the Russian government directed the hacks of the email accounts of Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) with specific intent to influence the outcome of the US presidential election. But Trump has consistently disputed their conclusion  —   which is based on actual forensic evidence, some of which is publicly available  —   suggesting instead that maybe the DNC actually hacked itself. “It could also be China; it could be someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds. You don’t know who broke into the DNC,” Trump said during the first presidential debate. Except that at least four different US intelligence agencies filled with professionals whose job it is to investigate these sorts of things have told us: It was Russia. Period. Full stop. And Trump knew this. He’d already been briefed on it at least once before that first debate. Yet he still said we didn’t know anything about who did it.  That alone was distressing. But back then, he was just a candidate. Now, he’s the man who is about to serve as the commander in chief of the entire US armed forces and the one empowered to dictate what the intelligence community focuses its resources on. Which means that his comments now are far more dangerous.  A president blindly believing everything he’s told is bad. A president trusting Russia more than his own intelligence agencies is worse. A president questioning the accuracy of some piece of intelligence he’s been given is fine  —   in fact, it’s really, really important. Having a president who blindly believes everything he is told without looking critically at the evidence or asking for second opinions can lead to bad decisions  —   like, say, invading Iraq over its supposed WMDs.      But let’s be clear: This is something very different. Trump is not quietly asking the intelligence officials who have briefed him to bring him more concrete evidence that Russia was behind the hacks. He’s not speaking with different intelligence agencies to make sure that this isn’t just the flawed analysis of one agency drowning out others who may be less convinced of Russia’s involvement. Both of those things would be perfectly acceptable. “I’m the first to acknowledge there’s room for a wide range of opinions of the results we generate. We don’t question that for one minute. And every intelligence professional knows that,” Rogers told the Senate panel.  “I have had plenty of times in my career when I have presented my intelligence analysis to commanders and policymakers and they’ve just looked at me and said, ‘Hey Mike, thanks, but that’s not the way I see it,” or “You’re gonna have to sell me on this.’ That doesn’t bother any of us,” he said. But, as Clapper pointedly stated, “there is a difference between healthy skepticism about intelligence information and disparagement.”  And disparagement is exactly what Trump is doing. He’s publicly slandering the US intelligence community and choosing instead to promote the claims of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange  —   an avowed   activist with close ties to Russia  —   that Russia had nothing to do with the email hacks.  As Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill asked, “Who benefits from a   trashing the intelligence community?” It’s a good question. Unfortunately, it’s not clear Trump has thought about  —   or cares about  —   the answer.": "195530",
    "Singer Christina Grimmie, a former contestant on The Voice, was shot by a gunman after a concert in Orlando, Fla. police say, and later died of her wounds. Orlando Police have identified Grimmie’s killer as    Kevin James Loibl. Grimmie was signing autographs for fans after the show at The Plaza Live late Friday, according to a statement from Orlando police. Then, ”detectives were told the suspect  —   who is not being identified at this time  —   walked toward Christina and shot her.” She was transferred to a hospital, where she later died. Grimmie’s brother immediately tackled the suspect after he opened fire, police say, and the suspect shot himself during the struggle. The police credit Grimmie’s brother for ”stopping him from causing any more harm to Christina and her fans.” They say ”the suspect was pronounced dead at the scene.” Orlando Police Chief John Mina told reporters that the suspect was carrying two handguns, additional magazines and a hunting knife. ”The suspect in this case is not from Orlando. The suspect traveled to Orlando, apparently to commit this crime, and then had plans to travel back to where he came from.” He came from another city in Florida, Mina said. Mina adds that ”there’s no indication that he knew her.” Law enforcement officials are searching the suspect’s phone, computer, home and car, and they say they hope these might point to a motive for the attack. Grimmie’s publicist Heather Weiss told The Associated Press in an email that ”we can confirm that Christina has passed and went home to be with the Lord.” Questions have been raised about security procedures at the concert venue after the attack. Mina said that he was not aware of metal detectors and people are not patted down. ”I’m told that the security measures in place are that people open their bags and the security people look inside those bags for weapons.” Grimmie finished third in the 2014 season of the NBC singing competition. As The Associated Press notes, ”She began amassing a following on YouTube as a teenager, gripping online viewers with her powerful renditions of hit songs. Her videos on YouTube have garnered millions of views.” Before the show, she posted a video on her Twitter account encouraging fans to attend. The Voice expressed its condolences on its official Twitter account: ”We are heartbroken,” it says. Grimmie ”is a loved member of our family. Our thoughts are with her and her family.” Grimmie was coached during the show by Maroon 5 singer Adam Levine, and he posted a photo of the two of them together on his Instagram account: ”I’m sad, shocked and confused. We love you so much Grimmie. We are all praying hard that you can pull through this. ..this just isn’t fair.” As The Associated Press notes, he posted the photo before her death was confirmed.

    "Democrat Hillary Clinton’s campaign needled Republican Donald Trump on Tuesday over his suggestion that if he is elected president, he might hold a   meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, joking that any strategy session would be redundant. “It’s unclear why Donald Trump needs to meet with Vladimir Putin on November 9th since he’s already repeating all his talking points, pushing his policy agenda and taking advantage of his espionage operation,” Clinton spokesman Glen Caplin said. “Rest assured that as president, Hillary Clinton will stand up to Putin in the face of his unacceptable behavior, not coddle him. ”  Trump said Monday that he would be willing to meet with Putin before Inauguration Day if he is elected president on Nov. 8. Such a meeting would break sharply with the precedent that a newly elected president defers to the sitting one in matters of state. “I think I could see myself meeting with Putin and meeting with Russia prior to the start of the administration,” Trump told conservative radio host Michael Savage during an interview. “I think it would be wonderful. ”  Trump said that “Putin has no respect at all for [President] Obama,” and suggested that he would command more of the Russian leader’s respect. The Clinton campaign accuses Russia of being behind a politically motivated computer breach of emails of the Democratic National Committee and of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. The Kremlin goal, Clinton says, is to hurt her and help Trump because Russia considers Trump friendlier toward Russia.  The winner of the U. S. election will inherit the worst    relations with Russia in more than two decades  —   worse than the deep anger and suspicion on both sides when Obama took office in 2009, hard on the heels of Russia’s war in Georgia and resulting U. S. sanctions and criticism. Clinton, as secretary of state during Obama’s first term, was charged with the “reset” of relations  —   an effort that largely failed and is now lampooned as naive. She has vowed a   approach if elected and says Trump is dangerously in thrall of the autocratic Putin. Putin has presided over a consolidation of power in Russia, a rollback of free speech and human rights at home, an expansion of Russian territorial ambitions in Ukraine and an effort to protect Russia’s autocratic ally in Syria. Russia under Putin’s second presidency also has shown less inclination to cooperate with the United States, although it helped negotiate the Iranian nuclear deal that Trump opposes and Clinton supports. The troubled relationship has competed with the threat of terrorism from the Islamic State as the dominant foreign policy issue in an American election that has focused little on events and issues beyond U. S. shores, and lately overshadowed it. In the interview Monday, Trump said that U. S.  relations are at their worst point since the Cold War. He blamed Obama and Clinton. “The problem is Putin has no respect for Obama, at all, doesn’t like him and doesn’t respect him. And Obama doesn’t like Putin. They have a great dislike for each other,” Trump said. “They insult him constantly. I mean, no wonder he can’t stand Obama and Hillary Clinton. ” Trump told Savage that he thinks he’s actually ahead in the polls, which show him trailing Clinton, and cited “tremendous enthusiasm” and crowd sizes at his rallies as evidence. The   website WikiLeaks is releasing Podesta’s hacked emails in batches. The campaign has neither verified nor denied their authenticity, pointing instead to what it calls the political and diplomatic implications of the release just weeks before the election. The emails paint a sometimes unflattering portrait of a bureaucratic and cautious campaign laden with advisers inside and outside the headquarters in Brooklyn. There have been no bombshells among the communications released to date. There are, however, many embarrassing examples of Clinton and her advisers appearing calculating and political as they manage and micromanage her policy positions and decisions about the message and tone of her campaign. Clinton’s campaign is focused on the final presidential debate, on Wednesday, not the emails, Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri said Tuesday. “This is an effort that’s led by the Russians. Intelligence agencies have confirmed that that is designed to hurt our campaign, so we’re not spending a lot of our own internal time doing that,” Palmieri told reporters traveling to the Las Vegas debate aboard Clinton’s plane. “I will note that if we needed more evidence that this is an effort that’s controlled by the Russians, on more than one occasion Russia today has actually posted emails from WikiLeaks even ahead of WikiLeaks,” Palmieri said. “So it’s pretty clear that they’re helping. ”": "216141",
    "Bernie Sanders did something previously unheard of in last night’s CNN debate: He stood up for Palestinians’ humanity.    ”As somebody who is 100 percent   in the long run,” Sanders said, ”we are going to have to treat the Palestinian people with respect and dignity.”  Related Read Clinton and Sanders’s remarkable exchange on    For many, this seems banal: Sanders is asserting that the US needs to understand Israeli and Palestinian beliefs to ultimately resolve the conflict. But in the context of a presidential primary, it’s historic. For years, mainstream candidates have hewed to a narrow ” ” line, blaming the conflict on the Palestinians and pledging strong support for Israeli policy. Democrats and Republicans have done this in different ways, to be sure, but generally speaking the Israeli perspective dominates.    Yet last night, the most successful Jewish candidate in primary history flipped the script. He inserted a line of argument, long common on the Israeli left, into the American political mainstream.    The ensuing argument he had with Clinton is the conversation Democrats (and perhaps America) have needed on Israel for years. The   exchange is an internal liberal argument going public            Sanders, as his comments make clear, is not taking a     position. He emphasized his support for Israel, and his time as a young man living in the Jewish state.    Rather, Sanders is championing what’s commonly called liberal Zionism, which holds (among other things) that you can both support the existence of Israel and be deeply critical of its treatment of the Palestinians at the same time. ”Of course Israel has a right to defend itself, but long term there will never be peace in that region unless the United States [recognizes] the serious problems that exist among the Palestinian people,” Sanders said during the debate. Clinton’s response, where she highlights her time as secretary of state, is extremely telling. She says that she, too, has stood up for Palestinians  —   but in private negotiations:     I’m the person who held the last three meetings between the president of the Palestinian Authority and the prime minister of Israel. There were only four of us in the room, [Prime Minister] Netanyahu, [President] Abbas, George Mitchell, and me. Three long meetings. And I was absolutely focused on what was fair and right for the Palestinians.  This has, for years, been the standard line among mainstream   Democrats. Criticize Israeli mistakes, to be sure, but do it in private. Public distance between the United States and Israel erodes trust between the two sides, which makes it hard for the US to broker peace negotiations. Many liberal Zionists, like Sanders, find this unsatisfying. They argue that Israel is headed on a   course, expanding settlements in the West Bank and choking off the possibility for a   solution. Backroom arguments aren’t good enough anymore; the US needs to warn Israel away from its current path. This is the meaning of Bernie’s sharpest dig in the debate: ”There comes a time when if we pursue justice and peace, we are going to have to say that Netanyahu is not right all of the time.” Sanders is saying that the US needs to publicly acknowledge Israeli mistreatment of the Palestinians, because the reality is that Palestinians are indeed suffering terribly  —   and   Israeli policies, championed by politicians like Netanyahu, are partly to blame. Clinton, he argues, has at various points (such as her recent speech to AIPAC, the   lobby) been too unwilling to emphasize. If Sanders gets his way, this would be a serious revision to the standard Democratic approach to the   conflict. We’ve started to see it under Obama  —   Obama has been publicly critical of Netanyahu on both settlement expansion and his attempts to obstruct the Iran deal. But Sanders wants to extend this criticism, arguing that the United States should take a more active role in championing Palestinian rights.    This isn’t an argument over whether the United States should continue to treat Israel as an ally and friend. It’s a question of how critical America should be of its ally over its treatment of the Palestinians  —   one that has long divided American liberals and Jews but is only starting to creep into mainstream Democratic discourse. Sanders busted a big taboo  —   and heralded a new Democratic discourse on Israel            Sanders is far from a perfect champion for the liberal Zionist position. Just hours before the debate, he suspended his Jewish outreach coordinator, Simone Zimmerman, for being overly harsh in her criticism of Netanyahu (disclosure: Zimmerman is a personal friend). But Sanders’s debate advocacy matters nonetheless. His unapologetically liberal Zionism is sending a signal to Democrats that it’s okay to be more critical of Israel. He’s a Jew who used to live in Israel; in recent polls, roughly half of all Democrats nationally have said they want him to be the party’s presidential nominee. It’s hard to overemphasize how taboo busting Sanders’s advocacy of Palestinian rights is. ”Bernie is opening a lot of space for a generation of Democratic politicians, and maybe for Clinton, re Israel,” BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith tweeted last night. And he’s right. Now, if Sanders didn’t speak for a large contingent on the American left, his positions wouldn’t matter. But opinion polls, and deeper structural trends in American politics, suggest that he does. Look, for instance, at a February Gallup poll on  . That poll found that a majority of Democrats, like virtually all American demographics, sympathize with Israel over the Palestinians.    But it also found that a majority of Democrats favor creating a Palestinian state: ”58% of Democrats supporting the establishment of a Palestinian state, compared with 26% of Republicans,” Gallup’s Lydia Saad reports. So while Democrats are quite sympathetic to Israel, they also believe Palestinians deserve a state of their own  —   unlike Republicans, who tend to sympathize with Israel in much larger numbers and be skeptical of Palestinian statehood. Sanders’s liberal Zionism, then, is no longer obviously a losing position for Democratic politicians to take. This view could only to strengthen over time. Republicans are taking an increasingly   view of being   owing largely to evangelical and neoconservative influences inside the party. Meanwhile, increasingly important Democratic constituencies  —   younger voters, black voters, Latino voters  —   all support Israel at lower rates than do other American demographic groups. And these demographic  groups are becoming an increasingly important constituency in the Democratic primary. Republican politicians will have growing political incentives to attack Democrats as insufficiently supportive of Israel. It’ll play well to both their base and the median voter. That threatens to code support for Israel, once a bipartisan issue, as a Republican one. The more it coded as partisan, the more comfortable Democratic politicians will become in criticizing Israel. Sanders’ view of Israel, then, is likely to become more mainstream, not less. His performance last night is the beginning of a long process of mainstreaming a more critical view of Israel in the Democratic Party. More traditional Democrats like Clinton are probably going to need to start learning how to deal with it.": "199980",
    "’  ’ ’     In Britain, McDonald’s fries have four ingredients: potatoes,     vegetable oil, dextrose, and salt.   ’ ’     In the U. S. McDonald’s fries have a whopping 19     ingredients —  including sodium acid pyrophosphate, which keeps     the fries’ color from getting dull. This is strange since you’d     think that all we really expect of French fries is for them to     at least vaguely mimic the color of a potato.   ’ ’     Then there’s McDonald’s strawberry sundae. In Britain’s     version, all the color comes from real strawberries. In the     U. S. we use Red No. 40. This plays out beyond the fast food     chain: For example, Starburst fruit chews are colored with     carotenes and chlorophylls across the Atlantic but with Red No.     40 and Yellow No. 6 in the U. S. Many major food companies in     the U. S. use artificial food dyes in America —  while selling     naturally colored or   versions in Europe.   ’ ’   Chemicals like Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5, and Blue No. 1 make   American food look better. These additives are the culinary   equivalents of lipstick and mascara, and they are often made from   the same pigments. Making food pretty has become the status   quo in the U. S. but it’s not doing us any good: Not only does it   trick us into thinking some foods are healthier than they are,   but the dyes themselves may be harmful. So why do we use   keep using these dyes when so many other countries manage without   them? ’ ’   It wasn’t always this way. Until the     century, natural food dyes from   plants, animals, and minerals were used to color food in the U. S.   Things changed when companies discovered artificial dyes which   were cheaper, brighter, and more stable than their natural   counterparts. Artificial dyes made food look more attractive,   which made them popular with consumers. America is a relatively   young and expansive country, and a major historical concern   involved feeding a growing population while moving food large   distances. Food was treated like a commodity, with market forces   shaping what were most valued: cost, convenience, and appearance.   For decades, there was little push to fret —  as Europeans did —  about   what was actually in our food. We just wanted it to look good. ’ ’      Lancet  ’ ’  ’ ’   After the Lancet study was published, some   academic skeptics who had doubted parental claims that food dyes   affected the behavior of healthy children admitted they might   have been wrong. In 2010, the European Parliament passed a law   requiring warning labels on products with any of the six tested   food dyes, and banned the use of food dyes for infants and young   children, effectively ridding much of the European food   supply —  which had low amounts of artificial food dyes to begin   with —  of artificial food coloring. The doses used for some of the   kids in this study, 20 to 30 milligrams of artificial food   coloring, were not as high as those typically ingested by   American children —  in fact, kids often consume far higher doses   than what was found to be harmful in clinical trials. ’ ’   The Food and Drug Administration reacted differently to the same   evidence. A  stated   that a causal relationship between dyes and hyperactivity was not   conclusively established based on available research, though the   report conceded that dyes made symptoms worse in children with   ADHD and other preexisting behavioral problems. Since this report   was published, evidence that food dyes cause problems has   continued to mount.  stated that   the negative effects of food dyes on children’s behavior weren’t   confined to those with ADHD. The latest  from the Center for Science in the   Public Interest, released in January, lamented the FDA’s inaction   and cautioned, “the harm to children and the costs to society   from dyes are needless and preventable. ” ’ ’   It is true that pulling conclusive, universal findings from   scientific research is a difficult task. Sure, there may be   evidence suggesting harm from food additives, but some of the   research was performed in animals and may not apply to humans.   More   research is needed to determine what happens   when healthy people ingest typical doses of common food   additives. We still don’t understand exactly what could be   causing the negative effects food coloring seems to have on kids   with certain conditions. All of these caveats are important to   recognize. ’ ’   But when it comes to food coloring, why should we have to prove   just   exactly how and why the   substance causes a negative effect on the people who consume it   before we can ban it? If this were a necessary or meaningful food   ingredient in any way, sure, that would be a reasonable standard.   But food coloring has no nutritional value. Why are we risking   it? ’ ’     ’ ’  ’ ’   Most likely because it helps companies sell products. Pretty food   pays off because aesthetics in food do matter. We have relied on   visual cues for thousands of years to help us determine what is   edible, nutritious, and safe to eat. Man has adapted to   appreciate natural colors, including a variety of green, red,   pink, orange, yellow, and purple produce: Colors signal that food   is ripe or that it contains healthy compounds. Because of that   evolutionary background, color is money for food manufacturers.   Children are especially attracted to a variety of bright, vibrant   colors and succumb to targeted marketing. Food dyes make   processed food more appealing. For example, margarine was   originally white —  manufacturers wanted to tint it yellow to appeal   to the public. Butter producers objected, saying this would   deceive the public. (In fact, butter is also naturally pale and   dyed yellow.) ’ ’   Food aesthetics can also affect how we perceive   taste.  when subjects   were given sugar water in different shades of red, they reported   that the deep red drinks tasted sweeter than the light red ones.   We’ve been primed to expect certain things from certain   colors:  showed   people had a harder time identifying drink flavors when the   drinks didn’t have the expected colors (an   drink   that was really   tasted like an orange). We expect   what nature has taught us, and even though our food system has   changed radically in the past several decades, our expectations   have yet to catch up. Food companies can instead use this   knowledge to trick us and make their processed products appear   more palatable. ’ ’   The reason why food coloring is still allowed is wrapped up in   the different approach the U. S. takes to food regulation. A key   element of the European Union’s public health protection policy   is the “precautionary principle,” under which credible evidence   of danger to human health merits protective action despite   scientific uncertainty. Unlike the EU, the U. S. government sets   high standards for proof of harm before regulatory action is   taken. In fact, the FDA’s “Generally Recognized as Safe” (GRAS)   designation, introduced in 1958, allows companies to evaluate   their own substances and deem them acceptable themselves, after   which the FDA can review the evaluation —  if it wants to. While   this makes sense for ingredients like salt and pepper, GRAS lets   producers take new food additives to the market without even   informing the FDA. Trans fat was classified as GRAS until the   label was withdrawn in 2015. ’ ’   As ingredient lists in other parts of the world show us, it’s   possible to still get basically the same experience without the   potentially negative consequences. Consumer demand can drive   change. Parents and activists have been petitioning food   companies to remove dyes for years, and some are   obliging: In February, candy giant Mars agreed to remove   artificial food coloring in all of its human food products over   the next five years. Mars’ recent decision echoes those made by   other food industry behemoths including Kraft, Nestle, and   General Mills. We’re lucky to have producers take this action,   but we shouldn’t have to wait for their benevolence. ’ ’     Last month, six former commissioners of the FDA met in Aspen,     Colorado, to critique the agency. They pointed out that     thousands of food additives are a part of our food system     because of the GRAS loophole, one that leaves safety decisions     to the producers rather than the FDA. We should tell the FDA     that we demand more: It is their job to keep us safe from these     unnecessary chemicals. In the quandary over brighter mac and     cheese and the risk of hyperactivity, the answer is easy —  let’s     tone down our food.   ’": "70545",

    "Washington (CNN) Donald Trump on Monday reiterated his support for the controversial practice of racial profiling by police amid increasing threats to the homeland. ”Our local police    they know who a lot of these people are. They are afraid to do anything about it because they don’t want to be accused of profiling,” Trump said on Fox News on Monday. Trump pointed to how Israel used profiling and ”done an unbelievable job.” Trump did not say on what attributes he would encourage police to profile possible suspects, but It’s illegal for police to subject US persons to disparate treatment based on their race or other protected status.  ”They see somebody that’s suspicious, they will profile,” Trump said. ”Look what’s going on: Do we really have a choice? We’re trying to be so politically correct in our country, and this is only going to get worse.” RELATED: Trump labels Clinton ’weak and ineffective’ in wake of bombings, Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, disputed that Trump meant police should start ”racial” profiling. ”I mean if authorities are going to look the other way, then at least we have a presidential candidate who is telling the Americans who say, ’I’m are so tired of looking the other way’ we don’t have a vetting process, we don’t have borders,” she told CNN’s Erin Burnett on ”Outfront” Tuesday. ”We have people so worried about political correctness that look at what this did the other night, people were injured.” The man suspected in Saturday’s bombings in New York and New Jersey was captured Monday after a manhunt and shootout. Ahmad Khan Rahami is suspected of bombings Saturday in New York City and Seaside Park, New Jersey, and is believed to be connected to pipe bombs found Sunday night in Elizabeth, New Jersey, sources told CNN. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declined to comment on the issue of profiling Tuesday. But Trump’s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, defended Trump’s comments. ”I think it’s all about common sense,” Pence told MSNBC’s Kelly O’Donnell. ”Talking with law enforcement officers, they’ll tell you that today they feel like they operate in an environment of political correctness, where they can’t use common sense to be able to target resources and target their energies against individuals who would be the most likely potential threat to our families and to the safety of our communities.” Trump ’bets’ terror suspect not on a watch list, Pence acknowledged the difficult balance between smart policing and respecting civil liberties, but cited Rahami as an example of how political correctness can hinder law enforcement.  The FBI said Tuesday that Rahami’s father was interviewed after a tip alleging that he called his son a terrorist, but the FBI never investigated Rahami or placed him on a FBI database of potential terrorists. ”I don’t know why that occurred but it smacks of the kind of political correctness and eggshells that law enforcement feels that they have to walk on in the environment that we’re in today,” Pence said. ”Of course it can (go wrong and infringe upon people’s rights) but we’re talking about common sense profiling.”": "57867",

    "In his testimony today before the Senate Judiciary Committee (on which I’ll have more to say in an upcoming column) FBI director James Comey has stuck by his claim that declining to bring charges against Hillary Clinton for mishandling classified information was the right call because proof of intent was lacking. This is unsurprising. The director has repeated this analysis many times. It hasn’t gotten better with age, but given his insistence that “no reasonable prosecutor” could possibly disagree with him, I’m not holding my breath waiting for him to reverse himself. \tIn my column over the weekend, discussing a lengthy New York Times report about the Clinton   investigation, I briefly rehashed why Comey is wrong about this: \t\tThis is a convoluted part of the story, stemming from the Justice Department’s effective rewriting of the applicable statute to avoid charging Clinton. As the Times tells it, the Justice Department and the FBI knew that to charge Clinton with a crime, it would not be enough to prove she had been “sloppy or careless” instead, “they needed evidence showing that she knowingly received classified information or set up her server for that purpose. ” As I have contended before, this claim is specious on multiple levels. Subsection (f) of the pertinent statute (the Espionage Act, codified at Section 793 of Title 18, U. S. Code) makes it a felony to mishandle classified information “through gross negligence”  —   i. e. proving Clinton was sloppy or careless (or “extremely careless,” to use Comey’s own description) could have been sufficient. But beyond that, Clinton willfully set up a private network for the systematic handling of her State   communications, in violation of federal   requirements of which she was well aware, and under circumstances in which she (a former senator who served for years on the intelligence Armed Services committee) was a sophisticated longtime consumer of classified information. She was keenly aware that her responsibilities as secretary of state would heavily involve classified information  —   whether it was “marked” classified or “born classified” because of the subject matter. \t\tIt is irrelevant whether Clinton’s purpose was to transmit or store classified information on the private,   server prosecutors are not required to prove motive. The question is whether she knew classified information would end up on the server, and her   made that inevitable. \t\tThat is, Clinton could have been prosecuted either for willfully mishandling classified information or for doing so through gross negligence. \tAs I elaborate in the column, the Times did not address the controlling statute in its   article. Instead, the story was that Clinton could not be charged because of the purported Petraeus precedent. We are to believe that the evidence of former CIA director David Petreaus’s criminal intent was far stronger than Clinton’s, yet he was not charged with the felony mishandling of classified information (he was permitted to plead guilty to a misdemeanor) ergo, it would have been an abuse of prosecutorial discretion to charge Clinton with the felony. \tI addressed this in the column as well: \t\tThis line of reasoning is fatuous  —   and it’s another instance of the Justice Department adopting Clinton campaign cant. Petreaus shared his classified diaries with a single person, a paramour who actually had a security clearance (albeit not one high enough to view what she was shown). Clinton’s offense was more extensive in duration and seriousness. \t\tAssuming the accuracy of the Times’s account, Comey is quite right that Petraeus should have been indicted on much more serious charges (as I have contended). But the Justice Department’s dereliction in Petraeus’s case was hardly a justification for giving Clinton a pass on a more egregious offense that, unlike Petraeus’s, (a) almost certainly caused the compromise of government secrets to foreign intelligence services and (b) resulted in the destruction of tens of thousands of government records  —   a separate felony. Clinton’s misconduct should have been prosecuted under the governing law, not excused based on the sweetheart plea deal Petraeus got. \t\tAll that said, we’re told the FBI thought it might be able to get over the purported Petraeus hurdle if it could find   to and from Clinton’s old BlackBerry. Because she was using this device right before she switched to the homebrew server, the theory was that those lost   might contain some   declaration of her criminal intent in setting up the server system. It’s as if, in a drug case, it’s not enough for agents to have the bag of heroin they found in the suspected trafficker’s house to prove intent, you apparently also need an   in which the trafficker says, “Gee, I hope there’s enough heroin in that bag I was planning to sell. ” \tHillary Clinton is a   lawyer who worked in government for many years. She was a very active first lady during her husband’s   presidency  —   mainly in the White House, where the handling of classified information is a major issue, even for   staffers. I mistakenly said in the weekend column that she had served on the Intelligence Committee in the Senate but my memory lapse was due to having previously said, correctly and on many occasions, that her assignment to the Armed Services Committee during years when the nation was at war made her a heavy consumer of highly classified   information. \tWhen she became secretary of state, she was briefed on the rules governing the handling of classified information, which she well knew would feature prominently and persistently in her duties. In her memoir, Hard Choices, Mrs. Clinton goes on at length about the exacting security procedures she knew she had to follow in handling classified information (e. g. she needed to read classified documents under an “opaque tent” in her hotel rooms while on travel and it was foremost in her mind that State Department officials are “frequently the target of cyberattacks”). \tWhen she was interviewed by the FBI at the close of its investigation, Clinton made laughably false statements regarding her familiarity with   protocols, including the whopper that she did not know what “(C)” meant  —   even though it is the designation for information classified at the “confidential” level, ubiquitous in classified documents. Prosecutors routinely use false exculpatory statements to prove mens rea in a criminal case. (Relatedly, Clinton also told the FBI she could not recall being briefed about retaining government records and handling classified information even though she signed a form acknowledging that she had been so briefed on January 22, 2009.) Moreover, in newly released book Shattered, about the 2016 Clinton campaign, authors Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes relate the story of how Clinton directed a trusted aide to download the server from her failed 2008 campaign in order to peruse stored staff   so she could figure out who leaked to the press. \tPatently, Hillary Clinton was well aware of (a) the highly classified subject matter of communications that would inevitably be passing through the private   system she set up for State Department business, in violation of statutes and government rules (b) the fact that   are stored on servers (c) the fact that the communications facilities and devices used by State Department officials are routinely targeted in cyberattacks by foreign intelligence services and other hostile actors and (d) the rules for the proper handling of classified information (and potential penalties for mishandling it). Consequently, her mishandling of classified information was knowing and intentional, as well as grossly negligent. Many reasonable prosecutors would salivate at the prospect of taking such a case to court, especially if they knew that Clinton was going to run with a “lack of intent” defense.

    "After making it to the top, Barack Obama is looking down. In October, the outgoing president signaled that he will focus on   politics when he leaves office. This promise took on new urgency after the election, which left Republicans in control of 32 statehouses and 33 governor’s mansions, not to mention both chambers of Congress and the White House. “One of the big suggestions that I have for Democrats as I leave   …     is how do we do more of that   building?” the president told NPR in December. “What I’m interested in is just developing a whole new generation of talent. ” Obama seems to be taking part in the larger process of soul searching among Democrats. “I wonder, sometimes, whether the Democratic Party has contributed to [a decline in local politics] by making the president and the federal government the fulcrum of so much, and suggesting that we can solve these problems from the top down,” said David Axelrod, the former senior Obama administration advisor, during a recent panel discussion at the University of Chicago. “Democrats have ceded a lot of statehouses and legislatures. Congress has been gridlocked. And the notion has been: What can the president do with the power that he has to try and create some progressive action? It just puts a lot of weight on the presidency, when maybe we have to be a bit more innovative. ” The Atlantic  Politics  Policy Daily: Congress Clocks In, These explanations are not primarily philosophical. They’re about winning. In the face of painful electoral losses, Democrats are rediscovering the strategic case for activism at the state and local level. Yet there are deep historical and ideological reasons why the party has tended to focus on the federal government as a means of making policy. An ideological shift would be much more important, and is more unlikely, than a strategic one. As Democrats move to focus on state and local politics in 2017, this distinction between ideology and strategy will be important to watch. The party, and progressives more broadly, could take up a friendly posture toward state and local governance on the grounds that Americans should directly influence the laws that constrain them and the policies that supposedly benefit them. Alternatively, this sudden impulse toward state and local organizing could prove instrumental and temporary, doomed to reversal whenever the party wins back the U. S. Senate or the White House. Democrats’ approach to federalism will matter for the future of the party and the permanence of its policies. But ultimately, it will show what Democratic leaders really believe about people’s proper role in their government. For some progressives, a renewed focus on state and local politics is primarily about obstructing Washington Republicans. Heather Gerken, a Yale law professor, wrote a piece for Vox about why the left should embrace federalism in the coming years —  essentially, she argued, it offers ways to counteract federal policies. “Progressives at the state and local level can influence policy simply by refusing to partner with the federal government,” she wrote. “If blue states and cities refuse to implement Trump’s agenda, Republicans will sometimes be forced to compromise rather than pay a political and fiscal price. ” For others, local politics are more important in their own right. “We think there’s a lot of importance in protecting local democracy,” said Nikki Fortunato Bas, the executive director of the Partnership for Working Families, a network of regional advocacy organizations that work on economic and environmental issues. “It’s in the communities [where] we live [that] we’re most connected to the need of our neighbors, and lawmakers are most connected to the needs of their constituents. ” Regardless of their reasons for wanting to focus on state and local politics, Democrats will be limited by the enormous imbalances of party power in governors’ mansions, state legislatures, and city halls. Especially during Obama’s second term in office, the party lost control and influence in a number of statehouses. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, the party controls roughly half as many state legislatures as it did in 2010, and roughly half as many states will enter 2017 with a partisan split compared to the same year. Similarly, Democrats have been losing governships steadily since Obama took office in 2008: Compared to the 29 states held by Democrats that year, the party now holds 16. The only place where Democrats still dominate across the country is in large cities, where they control many city halls. The unevenness is partly a reflection of progressives’ reluctance to push their policy agendas through states. Historically, arguments against federalism —  or the principle that power should be robustly shared between state and national governments —  have centered on race. “Progressives are deeply skeptical of federalism, and with good reason,” Gerken wrote in a 2012 essay in Democracy. “States’ rights have been invoked to defend some of the most despicable institutions in American history, most notably slavery and Jim Crow. ” Others see the decentralization of governing power as a way of stifling dissent, she argued. This is one reason why the national Democratic Party has often looked to Washington to make and enforce policy. But there’s another ideological explanation, argued Ernest Young, a professor of law at Duke University, in an interview: The progressive project is ultimately about working toward a society built on one unified vision of policy and culture, rather than a diverse array of policies and cultures. “If you’re confident that you can get the right answer to something, like   policy, or welfare, or any number of very difficult social problems, it’s hard not to say that right answer should be equally available to everyone,” Young said, meaning that progressives believe their “right answers” should be legislated through federal policy. “If you’re a more Burkean type of conservative, and you’re skeptical that we’re ever going to find out right answers to these questions, you might favor different solutions in different jurisdictions, and see from experience what works out. That tends to lend itself to a commitment to federalism, and local governments, too,” he said. Not all progressives believe that most policymaking should happen at the federal level. Especially in recent years, some policymakers have looked to cities and municipalities to lead reform efforts. “Cities were the original sites of disruption: They disrupt class orders they disrupt social practices they disrupt businesses,” said Jennifer Bradley, the director of the Center for Urban Innovation at the Aspen Institute. No matter what Obama and other national Democrats may say, this work has already been in progress, she added. “This notion that Democrats were relying too heavily on the federal government is belied by eight years of what actually happened,” she said. In part because Washington is so dysfunctional, “cities and states have learned to rely less and less on the federal government, and I think that trend will sharply accelerate. ” Practically speaking, the narrative that progressives favor federal policymaking while conservatives favor state and local action is far too simplistic. Both parties tend to use federal power when they have it. “George W. Bush, as a matter of ideology, cared a lot about states,” Young pointed out. “But the first thing he did as president was to shift power to the federal government in the area of education, which had been a terribly important area of state predominance. ” Conversely, both parties have used   litigation to intervene in federal policymaking when they’ve been out of power. Take Massachusetts vs. Environmental Protection Agency, the   Supreme Court case in which 12 states, several cities, and advocacy groups sued to force the EPA to begin regulating greenhouse gases. During the Obama years, other states pulled a similar move —  Texas sued the administration over deferred immigration enforcement for people in the country illegally, for example. “Broadly, I think federalism is not a conservative or liberal thing, or a Republican or Democrat thing,” Young said. “It offers a way of not having all your eggs in one basket when changes in who controls various institutions occur. ” It’s also a way of making sure one party doesn’t force the other permanently out of power at the national level: As Democrats are now discovering, it’s hard to get elected in districts that   state legislatures have gerrymandered to favor their own party. But there’s a reason why the United States is not a constellation of    . Federalism is a political orientation, not a body of   policy prescriptions. The negotiation of power between national and state governments —  and, relatedly, between state and local governments —  is complicated and partisan. Larger bodies of government, led by Democrats and Republicans alike, often threaten smaller bodies with litigation or funding cuts if they don’t follow certain policies. During the Reagan years, the federal government famously used this method to get states to comply with its policy on the legal drinking age. And in 2016, the Obama administration used a similar method when it sent a letter to school districts instructing them to comply with federal guidance on accommodations for transgender students. States often write laws limiting cities from legislating certain issues as well. North Carolina’s H. B. 2 may have been the most notorious of these kinds of prohibitions in 2016: Among other things, the statute prohibited cities from passing   ordinances to protect LGBT residents. Preemption on LGBT issues is fairly new, according to the Partnership for Working Families. States preempt cities and municipalities most frequently on issues like transportation regulations,   standards, labor agreements, and policies on earned sick days, the organization reports. If national Democrats are truly interested in revitalizing state and local governance, perhaps they’ll push to repeal these kinds of preemption laws, which force policy decisions into the realm of larger and larger legislative bodies. Or maybe they’ll swear off executive orders, on which the Obama administration heavily relied, whenever they eventually regain federal power. It’s not like voters are big fans of the federal government, anyways: According to Pew Research Center, Americans’ trust in bodies like Congress has been declining for at least the last decade, while their belief in state and local bodies is much higher and has remained relatively constant over the years. This might be the most compelling of all arguments for a new era of federalism: Voters simply don’t like or trust the federal government. As a new administration prepares to take office, “The one thing I really hope states and locals can do is model a different kind of political behavior,” Bradley said. “What I would hope is that the actions of state and local lawmakers can restore people’s faith and trust, honestly, in democracy. ”": "73310",
    "It’s tempting to look to the playbooks and historical traditions of the late Soviet Union to explain the audacity of today’s Russian intelligence activity, from its meddling in U. S. elections, to apparently killing Kremlin opponents abroad. But these activities are not just products of old ways or new geopolitics. They also stem from a shift in the activities of Russia’s political police force, the infamous Federal Security Service (FSB). Originally established to protect the Kremlin’s rule at home, it has increasingly moved into Russia’s foreign operations. A new cohort of secret policemen, ignorant of the traditions of spycraft and secure in Putin’s protection, has fundamentally altered the nature of Russian intelligence. The FSB stands accused not just of engineering the leaks against Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, but also backing extremist parties in Europe, stirring up discontent among   minorities in the Baltic, allegedly murdering Chechen opposition leaders in Turkey and Austria, spreading disinformation, and even kidnapping an Estonian security officer across the border in 2014. And according to the infamous unverified dossier published by Buzzfeed on January 10, it also collected compromising information on Trump with the suspected aim of turning him into Vladimir Putin’s puppet. One has to go back to Soviet times for such a rich array of proven and suspected covert adventures abroad. The Biggest Intelligence Questions Raised by the Trump Dossier, By allowing the FSB to move into foreign intelligence and covert operations, though, Putin has —  probably inadvertently —  unleashed a beast. The FSB is playing a central role in current developments not because it possesses greater technical capabilities than the other Russian agencies, but because, for the most part, it does not recognize or respect the same limitations as the rest of Russia’s security services. To put it crudely, the FSB does the kinds of things everyone else thinks about doing but doesn’t because they’re too risky, too politically inflammatory, or too likely to backfire. The FSB is just the latest,   iteration of the old Soviet KGB. In one of his many toxic legacies, former Russian President Boris Yeltsin ignored calls to disband an institution that appeared beyond repair and rebuild it from scratch. Instead, after 1991, he opted to partition the KGB. Its first chief directorate, responsible for espionage, was simply rebranded as the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). Most of the directorates tasked with domestic security were gathered together first under the umbrella of the Ministry of Security, then the Federal   Service, and, in 1995, the FSB. Since then, the FSB has not looked back, especially after 1998, when for a brief time it was headed by a     officer whose career was about to experience an unexpected boost —  one Vladimir Putin. In the years since, the FSB has been one his staunchest allies, hounding and discrediting his rivals, looking after his underlings, and clamping down on any spasms of popular protest. In return, he has shielded, empowered, and elevated the agency, turning a blind eye to corruption in its ranks, allowing it to   rival agencies such as the Federal   Service (Russia’s equivalent to the DEA, which was abolished in 2016) and giving its officers key positions, from regional governorships to head of his security council. Traditionally, Putin controlled Russia’s sprawling bureaucracy by creating multiple, overlapping agencies, that he would then play off against each other. This is especially evident within the intelligence community. In Ukraine, for example, the SVR, FSB, and GRU, the military intelligence agency, all ran competing operations. When former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych was toppled by the “Euromaidan” revolution in 2014, catching Moscow by surprise, the result was a hurried game of   . Although the FSB had been the agency most closely associated with Yanukovych and had argued most forcefully that he would survive, it enjoyed Putin’s support, and so the SVR wound up taking the blame for the intelligence failure. One result of the agencies fighting over the same turf has been the increasing intrusion of the FSB into foreign operations. In 2003, the agency absorbed most of the electronic eavesdropping and   capabilities of FAPSI, Russia’s equivalent of the NSA. In 2005, it began operating in   neighboring states. In 2006, Russia passed a law allowing military force to be used “to suppress international terrorist activity outside the Russian Federation” —  just before the murder of defector Alexander Litvinenko in London. As the FSB’s stature rose, that of its competitors in Russian intelligence was falling. By the late 2000s, the GRU was in disgrace, due to its blunders in Russia’s 2008 war with Georgia, leading to abandoned airfields being bombed and Russian units getting outflanked. Putin also felt the SVR was too conservative and timid for limiting itself to simple  . It had failed to present Washington as being as aggressive as he believed it to be. He was increasingly coming to believe that the United States was leading a campaign to isolate Russia and deny it the   status he felt it deserved. He saw the “Color Revolutions,” for example, as U. S.  plots to topple   governments (Georgia in 2003, Ukraine in 2004, and Kyrgyzstan in 2005) and interpreted NATO’s 2011 intervention in Libya as a sign that Washington remained committed to aggressive regime change. The more Putin came to see the West as a threat, the more he felt he needed his spooks both to collect information and to serve as active instruments of his geopolitical ambitions. This perspective seems to have crystallized during his brief time as prime minister and as the power behind the throne, from 2008 to 2012. The FSB scrambled to fill the spook gap left by the flailing GRU and SVR. Suddenly, it was briefing Putin on foreign policy, edging its way into the traditional turf of the SVR and the foreign ministry. It lobbied hard and successfully for the funds and the mandate to mount political operations, first in Europe, then beyond, from funneling resources to populist parties and separatist groups, to penetrating both Democratic and, to a limited extent, Republican National Committee computers. When an indiscreet conversation between Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and U. S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt emerged in 2014, it was almost certainly both intercepted and then leaked by the FSB. It may even have hijacked SVR and GRU operations: Intelligence insiders told me of FSB reports that claimed credit for information gathered by other agencies. The FSB could do all this because it had Putin’s trust, and because it realized that he increasingly wanted his spies to tell him what he wanted to hear. As one embittered former SVR officer put it to me, “our mistake was to keep talking about the world as it is, not as he would like it to be. ” Thus, the FSB’s political police officers flattered their way into a privileged position, getting tasked with manipulating elections, wooing electorates, and lobbying politicians across the West. These are not just spies under a different acronym, though. Most do not know or respect the etiquette of the shadow war. Their backgrounds as secret police in an authoritarian state make them especially prone to bullying and blackmailing, corrupting and killing. They also operate under far fewer constraints than traditional spies. So long as they remain in Putin’s favor, they can (sometimes literally) get away with murder. Even Russia’s   Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, once able to challenge the spies, is now limited to cleaning up their messes. This has all resulted in a brazen new turn in Russian intelligence operations, with the FSB at the helm. They were behind the   kidnapping of Estonian security officer Eston Kohver in 2014, and, according to sources in Moscow, were behind the DNC leaks, even if the GRU actually collected the emails. They are the ones most eagerly backing and bankrolling divisive extremists and populist leaders in Europe. This is despite the fact that the SVR and GRU have a great deal more experience. But the FSB’s greatest asset is its sheer willingness to take chances. In that respect, it is simply mirroring Putin himself, who has played his weak hand well, precisely by —  at least in the   era —  being more unpredictable and confrontational than anyone else. How will this work out in the long term? When the FSB kidnapped Kohver, it managed to draw attention to the very issue it sought to keep hidden: its own links with organized crime, which subsequently became the focus of more intensive investigation in both Estonia and Europe as a whole. One Italian   officer who had for years been warning about this problem, for example, told me that within a month he had been given the green light to open new investigations into corruption among Russian security officials. Similarly, the agency’s hacking of Western politics looks worryingly effective, but is generating a backlash in the West against Russian interference and disinformation. It has become the story of the moment on both sides of the Atlantic, with the German and French security services warning that Moscow will try to manipulate upcoming elections in both countries. Just as dangerously, the SVR, GRU, and other agencies, have followed the FSB’s lead in tailoring their briefings to flatter Putin’s prejudices and assumptions. As a result, the one man who decides Russian strategy has become cocooned in an   latticework of   dubious interpretations, and ludicrous optimism, which may make him prone to dangerous adventures —  deeper engagement in the Syria quagmire, a wider invasion of Ukraine, or tangling directly with NATO or China. In the long run, the FSB may well be as dangerous to Putin as to the West.": "73593",

    "Whenever folks in Penfield, New York get a hankering for pancakes for lunch  —   they head over to the 5 Mile Café. The   restaurant is known in those parts for serving breakfast any time of the day (order their homemade corned beef hash). Click here to join Todd’s American Dispatch: a   for conservatives! They are also known for their patriotism. “We are very patriotic here at the café  —   all year round  —  not just this time of year,” owner Jennifer Aquino told me. “We have American flags and patriotic things around the café. ” So Jennifer decided to ask the town for a permit so she could post a “God Bless America” banner on the front of her restaurant.  She wanted to display the banner from Memorial Day through Independence Day. There was just one significant problem. Penfield has a strict banner allotment policy. Businesses are only allowed to post banners for a total of three weeks out of the year. And Jennifer had used up her allotment. “At one point we had banners all over the town and the town just looked trashy and our residents said enough’s enough,” town supervisor Tony LaFountain told WHEC. Jennifer’s request was denied. Instead of posting the banner outside the restaurant, she posted it inside. And that was that  —   until the Orlando terrorist attack.

They warned her that she could face a possible fine for violating the ordinance. “I didn’t take it down,” Jennifer told me. “And I was willing to pay the fine. ” “The [message on the banner] means a lot to me  —   especially during this time in our country with all that’s going on with terrorism,” she said. “I just can’t believe that I can’t have this banner up and be supported by the town board. ” You would think most folks would appreciate the sentiment behind “God Bless America. ” Lord knows we need it. But rules are rules and the town board does not seem interested in accommodating Jennifer’s patriotic banner. “The fact that I’m being asked to take it down is wrong,” she said. “It’s against my First Amendment rights. People need to open up their eyes. If we start letting them tell us we can’t do this  —   it’s going to get worse. ” Lots of folks seem to agree with Jennifer’s sentiment. Hundreds and hundreds of supporters have posted messages on the café’s Facebook page and several customers have dropped off money  —   to help pay for any fines. Jennifer tells me she never imagined there would be a day like this in America. “I have lots of veterans in my family,” she said. “I have a cousin who fought in Desert Storm so that we could have the freedom to hang a banner that says, ‘God bless America. ’” And yet we live in a nation where you can be punished for simply being patriotic.

    "With Bernie Sanders now leading in both Iowa and New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton’s been trying to blunt his economic populist appeal by showing that she, too, is serious about taxing rich people. First she proposed a new 4 percent surcharge on all income above $5 million (including capital gains and investment income) and now she’s proposing a hike in the estate tax. Clinton would increase the maximum rate to 45 percent from the current maximum of 40, and decrease the lifetime exemption from estate and gift taxes to $3. 5 million from $5. 45 million.    But it’s important to put this proposal in context. Not only does the 45 percent figure pale in comparison to Sanders’s proposed 65 percent top rate, but a 45 percent top rate is actually quite low by historical standards. The current 40 percent rate, and the 35 percent rate that preceded it, are the lowest since 1932. The rate peaked at 77 percent, and stayed there from 1940 to 1976. When President Clinton left office, it was 55 percent. It was only after the Bush tax cuts ratcheted the tax back, ultimately eliminating them in 2010, that President Obama and   Minority Leader Mitch McConnell reached a deal to retroactively bring the tax back at 35 percent for that year. The 2012 tax deal raised the rate again to 40 percent, where it’s been ever since:              The $3. 5 million exemption is also very high by historical standards:              In fairness, Sanders’s plan is more tepid than it initially appears. The 65 percent rate only applies to estates worth $1 billion or more. His exemption would also be $3. 5 million for individuals, just like Clinton’s. They’d even share the 45 percent rate for estates between $3. 5 million and $10 million; Sanders adds a 50 percent bracket for estates between $10 million and $50 million, and then a 55 percent bracket for estates larger than that, plus a 10 percent surtax for billionaires (hence the 65 percent figure). It’s a significantly bigger tax hike than Clinton’s, but it still doesn’t get the estate tax back up to its 1999 or 2000 levels.    Clinton and Sanders are also both declining to pursue more fundamental reforms to the   ”death tax.” A number of tax analysts, notably NYU Law’s Lily Batchelder, have proposed moving to an inheritance tax, where the living beneficiaries of an estate, rather than the deceased person’s estate itself, would include inheritance money in their taxable income and perhaps pay an additional surtax on it. This ensures that the most affluent inheritors pay the most, and giving each beneficiary a lifetime exclusion of $1 million to $2 million would encourage estates to distribute to more people, breaking themselves up into smaller pieces and more effectively combating entrenched dynamic wealth than the current tax. Inheritance taxation also has a political benefit, in that it would mean the government is not technically taxing dead people.": "198719",
    "Donald Trump thinks you’re an idiot. Not just you, though. Pretty much all Americans.  Catherine Rampell is an opinion columnist at The Washington Post. View Archive   Facebook Google+   He seems to have taken a timeless insight often attributed to H. L. Mencken  —   that no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American people  —   and applied it to politics. Don’t believe me? Take but one recent, nearly   example.  On Sunday’s “Face the Nation,” host John Dickerson asked the Republican presidential   what he took away from a recent church service that he attended in Iowa. The subject of the sermon: humility.   Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump spoke in front of a crowd in Iowa following the caucuses. Trump finished second to Ted Cruz. (Reuters)   Behold this   exchange: TRUMP: “It was very good. It was very a nice service, beautiful church. I liked it. ”  DICKERSON: “But humility, a lot of people don’t think  —   your name is on everything. You have often talked about sometimes braggadocio is part of your pitch. ”  TRUMP: “No, I know, but there is more humility than you would think, believe me. ”  DICKERSON: “Hidden humility. ”  TRUMP: “We are all the same. We’re all going to the same place, probably one of two places, you know, but we are all the same. And I do have actually much more humility than a lot of people would think. ”  Got that? Trump is very, very, unbelievably, terrifically humble. And (with apologies to Churchill) he has much to be humble about.  Trump, after all, is a man who has previously declared himself to be, in roughly his own words: ● Really rich; very rich; very smart; very handsome; very strong on the Second Amendment; very strong on border security; very, very strong on the debt limit; very loyal, to a fault.  ●In possession of the world’s greatest memory, as well as one of the highest IQs.  ●   but not necessarily one of these people who sits there all day and thinks about himself.  ●Like Ronald Reagan, FDR, Batman.  ●Loving of   beloved by the Mexican people, China, Iowans, “the blacks,” “the Muslims,” women, everybody.  ●Very friendly with a lot of people on both sides of the aisle, a very nice person who gets along very well with people, a great unifier.  ●The worst thing that ever happened to the Islamic State, the least bigoted of anybody you’ve ever met, the least racist person on earth, the person who will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.  And of course: ●A candidate who could shoot somebody in the middle of New York’s Fifth Avenue and not lose voters. If these aren’t the statements of someone with boatloads of humility, well, maybe Trump doesn’t know what the word “humility” means.  Or, more likely, he doesn’t think the rest of us do. Likewise, on issues besides his own character, Trump has also taken to   voters’ intelligence.  He absurdly promised to make Mexico pay for a big, beautiful wall that would keep Mexicans out of the United States. (In my fantasies, this wall would really be a scheme to make Mexico and the United States fall madly in love, “Fantasticks” ; alas, such an outcome seems unlikely.)  Among his other infrastructure priorities is a new $100 million ballroom for the White House. “We’ll get the top people, the top everything, we’ll have the best ballroom,” he said at a recent political rally, as if he believed this were really a   policy issue crucial to the success of the American republic.  He promised that his tax plan would raise taxes on the rich and not reduce revenue, even though basic arithmetic and the most generous of economic assumptions say the opposite. He promised to get rid of Obamacare and replace it with “something terrific” but as yet unspecified. He promised to grow the nation’s economy by 6 percent or 7 percent, when the Federal Reserve predicts   growth rates of 2 percent.  Only someone who thinks Americans are really, really dumb would expect voters to buy any of this.  Of course, Trump is hardly the only candidate to treat voters like we have IQs around room temperature.  Other candidates’ tax plans, foreign policy proposals, regulatory schemes and economic predictions also often depend on assumptions of widespread idiocy within the populace. And to some extent, this has always been true. But Trump, innovative political entrepreneur that he is, has just gone bigger and bolder, assuming Americans are even dumber than anyone ever thought possible. Not that Americans themselves agree. In a recent Pew Research Center poll, about   of respondents said that the word “intelligent” describes the typical American fairly or very well.

Mr. Hannity had asked why President Obama is insisting 10, 000 “refugees” from the Middle East are brought immediately to America, and why Democratic nominee Hilary Clinton advocates increasing numbers by “500 per cent”. “Why are they so willing to gamble with the lives of Americans considering this has now happened at least a dozen times?” he asked. “I think that they’re so keen to have them coming in here because their Muslim Brotherhood advisers are telling them that is best for the West,” said Mr. Higgins. “We see Muslim Brotherhood influence through NGO organisations as well as affiliated with United Nations elements on the ground in Syria [and] on the front end of the vetting process in Syria  —   which is why you see 99 per cent of the people coming out are actually Muslims, not the Christians, not the ones being most persecuted,” he said. “They’re on the back end here in the United States, coordinating their reception  …     once they arrive both in Europe and then here in the United States,” he added.": "40884",
    "Washington (CNN) Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump could announce his running mate pick before the party’s convention to help drum up excitement heading into Cleveland, a source familiar with the process told CNN.  Trump, who has repeatedly said his choice for vice president was down to as few as four candidates though sources tell CNN the list is closer to seven, and his aides had previously said the pick would likely be announced at the convention. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich are among the finalists, sources confirmed to CNN on Thursday. Christie    a former Trump rival turned top defender    has received the official paperwork for the vetting process, according to a source with knowledge of events. And Gingrich is being ”seriously considered” for the job, a Trump adviser said. In choosing either Christie and Gingrich, Trump would satisfy his desire for someone with political experience who could help him advance his legislative agenda through Congress. The New York Times was first to report Christie’s vetting. The Washington Post reported Thursday evening that Gingrich was also being vetted, with Sens. Jeff Sessions,   and Bob Corker,   also emerging as final contenders, but a source very close to the campaign said the Post’s report was inaccurate. The source added, however, that a surprise choice could also be in store. Trump is also meeting with Indiana Gov. Mike Pence Saturday at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, a source with knowledge of the meeting told CNN. Pence spokesman Marc Lotter told CNN on Friday that the meeting is ”consistent with the meetings that Mr. Trump is scheduling with many key party leaders.” A Trump adviser told CNN Pence is being considered for VP. Trump’s campaign chairman Paul Manafort has been pushing the idea of Pence as his running mate, according to another source.  A top Trump surrogate, Though Christie ran against Trump in the GOP primary, the two have been   friends and Christie quickly endorsed Trump and became a reliable presence at his events after dropping out of the race. The New Jersey governor has not only been one of Trump’s   surrogates, continually defending him against critics, but also one of his closest behind the scenes advisers, according to sources familiar with the relationship.  Road to 270: The 2016 Electoral Map, Trump, speaking with Concord, New   CNN affiliate   on Thursday demurred when he was asked whether Christie or former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown were on his running mate shortlist. ”Well, they’re both good guys. I don’t want to say shortlist but certainly they’re great people,” Trump said. ”Scott was a very early supporter and Chris was very early after he got out. And they’re certainly people I want involved.” For Christie, it has been quite a departure from what he initially sought out to do in 2016: win the GOP nomination. Blunt, with a big personality and a history of electoral success in a reliably blue state, Christie was once seen as a    or perhaps the      for the GOP nomination. Wounded by the fallout from revelations related to top aides deliberately closing lanes on George Washington Bridge as a form of political retribution, Christie still mounted a 2016 bid. In it, he wasn’t afraid to take a few shots at Trump, though he was always quick to point out that he and his wife, Mary Pat, were long time friends of the New York billionaire. ”Showtime is over, everybody,” Christie said while campaigning in New Hampshire in January. ”We are not electing an   . Showmanship is fun but it is not the kind of leadership that will truly change America.” GOP senator says endorsement could hinge on Trump’s running mate, For a brief period at the end of 2015, Christie appeared to have righted his campaign, only to see it come apart under withering attack ads in the lead up to the New Hampshire primary. A disappointing finish in the state led to the end of his run, and, a few weeks later, to the endorsement of Trump. It was a move surprised    and even angered    many of the players inside his presidential campaign, sources say. One said the move was ”such clear careerism    this wasn’t the man I signed up to work for.” Yet Christie has carved out an integral role inside Trump’s orbit. He’s operated, aides and advisers say, as a sort of   counselor of sorts to Trump in recent months    part strategist, part sounding board, part friend, and often (perhaps to the surprise of many in his home state of New Jersey) a calming voice of reason. ”It’s fascinating that I’m now the person that can speak my mind without offending anyone,” Christie told reporters earlier this month. When Trump was getting chastised by others in the GOP for his criticism of a federal judge over seeing a Trump University lawsuit, Christie said the billionaire was perfectly justified. ”In the end, there are always going to be conflicts regarding civil lawsuits. People are always going to express their opinions. Those are Donald’s opinions, and he has a right to express them,” he said. ”I can guarantee you that, you know, people who are going to vote today in (New Jersey) and people who are going to vote in November are not going to make their decision based upon this kerfuffle.” He added: ”I’ve known him for 14 years and Donald Trump is not a racist.” RELATED: Trump vs. the GOP (redux) Behind the scenes his role was more robust    he spent hours that day at Trump Tower, helping Trump craft a statement designed to put the issue behind the campaign, and sticking around to help him craft a subsequent speech. Christie has also been a top recruiter for Trump    both on the endorsement and fundraising side of the campaign. He’s been a regular caller to top GOP donors and activated his own network to try and bolster Trump’s moribund fundraising operation. The former head of the Republican Governor’s Association, he’s also regularly been in contact with GOP governors on the fence    or off it on the side of #NeverTrump    regarding Trump’s candidacy. The calls and meetings are described as cordial, even in cases where the answers are no. But one message has been clear: Trump is going to win    get on board now. It’s advice Christie himself took and could now benefit from more than anyone. He was Trump’s biggest endorsement at a crucial moment in the campaign and that has sparked talk about any number of possible positions inside a Trump administration. He has been the focus of vice presidential speculation for some time, leaving the possibility open when asked by reporters. That has led to no shortage of questions about Christie’s intentions with that endorsement, both among unaffiliated GOP officials, but also former aides. And it hasn’t always been a smooth process. There was the press conference where an entire Twittersphere jokingly wondered whether Christie had been taken hostage. (”I want everyone to know for those who were concerned: I wasn’t being held hostage,” Christie told reporters afterward.) There was the moment it appeared his wife    one of Christie’s top political advisers    appeared to roll her eyes at a Trump attack on Clinton during another press conference. Then Trump, during an event scheduled to help Christie retire his campaign debt, appeared to jab the New Jersey governor about his weight, saying: ”You’re not eating Oreos anymore, are you? No more Oreos for either of us, Chris. Don’t feel bad.” There’s also been Christie’s own political standing    by May, his approval numbers were down nearly 40 points from their high in November 2013. Christie for his part, has brushed all of those issues aside and maintained his endorsement was contingent on one thing: Trump represents the party’s best chance to defeat presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Whatever his reasons, this much is clear: Christie is all in. One adviser who spoke with CNN described Christie as a consigliere of sorts. Late night phone calls aren’t rare    Trump bouncing ideas and strategies off of Christie, complaints as well. But he also listens, this adviser added. That, the adviser said, may be the most important takeaway: Donald Trump, as much as Donald Trump can, listens to Chris Christie. An early Trump ally, Gingrich emerged early in the 2016 cycle as one of Trump’s most vociferous defenders, especially on cable television, where the former speaker has become one of the more colorful pundits. A longtime Washington fixture, Gingrich has deep ties to the nation’s leading lobbyists and has long fashioned himself as a political historian. Gingrich   his political touch during his 2012 presidential run, when he ran a spirited, at times   campaign against eventual nominee Mitt Romney. Gingrich won plaudits in the primary for excoriating the media, most prominently at a number of Republican debates. Yet despite his unmistakable position as a Washington insider, Gingrich was one of the earlier DC elites to repeatedly defend Trump. And his work as a surrogate has long earned him a place on handicappers’ list of those who might serve as Trump’s No. 2. But he said as recently as Sunday that he had not been formally asked to be considered. ”Nobody’s called me. Nobody has said, ’Would you like to be? ’’’ Gingrich said on ”Fox News Sunday.” ”Nobody has said anything.” And some thought his positioning in the Trump veepstakes was weakened by his criticism over Trump’s recent attacks on a federal judge with Mexican heritage who is overseeing a lawsuit against Trump University. Gingrich called Trump’s language ”completely unacceptable.” ”I thought it was inappropriate what he said,” Trump said of Gingrich at one point, adding that he was ”surprised” he would say so.": "55693",
    "GOP frontrunner Donald Trump returned to the campaign trail after a few days off, continuing his nationalist message of “America first” when talking to his supporters at his afternoon campaign rally in Rochester, New York on Sunday. [“You need somebody fast,” the real estate mogul said after listing various percentages of jobs lost from a number of different industries in New York.  In particular, Trump blamed NAFTA for the loss of manufacturing jobs. “I’ve been talking about this for five years,” Trump said about the currency manipulation in trade deals. He also referenced Sentry Safe, a manufacturing company headquartered in Rochester, and how it just moved operations to Mexico. “I’m the only one that knows how to stop it,” he said of businesses moving out of the country. Trump said he had been asked by a group of people from the Rochester area to run for governor. “They asked me to run for governor. Between you and I, I sort of said, ‘I’m sorry, I’m doing something else. ’” “This is what the something else was,” Trump said, referencing his presidential campaign. “I think I could have a lot bigger effect on upstate New York and Rochester by doing what I’m doing. ” “You would have been fracking” a long time ago, he said about the people of New York. Trump referenced Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) questioning whether Hillary Clinton was qualified to run for president, adding that she’s made many mistakes. “I look so forward to going after Hillary after these guys  …     it’s going to be easy,” he touted. Trump also talked about what he called a rigged system regarding the delegate count in light of recent reports that rival Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) is stacking the deck with delegates favorable to him. “This is a cooked system, folks,” he said, adding that Sanders is facing a rigged system on the Democrat side as well regarding delegate count heading into the national convention. “I win Louisiana  …     then I find out that I get less delegates than Cruz because of some nonsense going on,” Trump said. “I say this to the RNC and I say it to the Republican Party, you’re gong to have a big problem,” because people don’t like what’s happening. “We’re supposed to be a democracy,” he added. “You vote and the vote means something. ” “I have millions of votes more than Cruz,” Trump charged. “It’s not right, folks. ” “It’s not fair to you people,” he said, adding, “They’re taking your vote away. ”": "38421",
    "Breitbart Tech   Milo Yiannopoulos joined Breitbart News Daily with host Breitbart News    Alex Marlow to discuss how progressives and social media networks are manipulating and censoring discussions and the news. [“Where do you think this is going to take the news world and the world in general, where are we getting our information, how is the landscape changing from your vantage point?” Marlow asked in reference to the media’s covering of stories.  “It’s not a hugely positive outlook, I’m sorry to say,” Yiannopoulos replied. “The mainstream media continues to move in this bizarre, sort of   distortion field direction, insisting on covering things up. And then when it becomes impossible to deny that, for example, marauding gangs of sexual molestation and rapists are from a particular place or a particular religion or arrived in the country in a particular way, then the story becomes about, ‘Oh it was the police covering it up, not us, not the media. ’” “They think people are so stupid, so idiotic,” he continued. “And the problem of course is that when you look at the means through which people can circumvent that system, social media, sharing information with each other about what actually happens as the press isn’t doing its job properly, you discover that almost every social network is in cahoots with national governments or is simply ideologically aligned with the progressive media to cover that stuff up. ” Yiannopoulos noted that discussion of the alleged mass sexual assaults in Cologne on New Year’s Eve had been censored on Reddit. “Until it became impossible to ignore, you weren’t really allowed to talk about the ethnicity and origins of the assailants,” he explained. “Twitter does many of the same things. Facebook is possibly the worst offender. It announced, proudly in fact, that it had teamed up with the German government to remove what they referred to as ‘hate speech’  …     about immigration,” Yiannopoulos continued. “What of course they actually mean is criticism and ridicule of the government’s immigration policies and the government’s refugee policies. ” “Your options to find information and to discuss what’s going on, to express your concerns, your anxieties, your options online are actually pretty limited. There aren’t many places you can go to tell the truth,” Yiannopolous stated. “Disaffected liberals, liberals who are so frustrated with their own side, with their own media  …     are coming over in their droves to sites like Breitbart because we actually tell the truth about things. ” Marlow noted that many social media sites are “putting their thumb on the scale away from the direction of free speech” and that Breitbart is becoming a “free speech central home for people who are disaffected” by outlets that are shutting down discussion from users for challenging the established news narrative. “Progressives have invented this new way of shutting down discussion they don’t like by calling it ‘harassment,’ by calling it ‘threats,’ by calling it ‘abuse,’” Yiannopoulos concurred. “What they do is they mischaracterize criticism and ridicule of the establishment consensus. ” “You’re going to be hearing a lot, if you haven’t already, over the next year or two about   abuse and harassment on the Internet. And what these journalists really mean is, ‘Someone caught me telling a lie,’” he continued. “You’ll see on news sites, whether it’s the Daily Beast or CNN, all kinds of huge, supposedly mainstream,     news organizations, they’re all closing their comments sections. Why? Because readers are smarter, more honest, and more ruthless about the truth than journalists are these days. ” In closing, Yiannopoulos pointed out how absurd this tactic has become by highlighting comments from Ralf Jaeger, interior minister for North   who said, “What happens on the   platforms and in chatrooms is at least as awful as the acts of those assaulting the women,” in reference to reports of mass sexual assaults on New Year’s Eve across Germany by suspected migrants. “Just to be completely crystal clear to listeners, he is saying that words on the internet, people expressing their frustration with their communities changing, with mass Muslim immigration, mass Syrian refugee immigration, words on the internet are as bad as rape,” he stated. “That’s what an elected politician in Germany said. ” Noah Dulis is the Deputy Managing Editor of Breitbart News and   of Breitbart Tech.

    "PHILADELPHIA  —   House Speaker Paul Ryan ( ) told members Wednesday that he believes Republicans can have a tax reform package finished by the August recess. According to multiple members of Congress at the GOP retreat in Philadelphia, that plan right now is for Republicans to use the FY 2018 budget to overhaul the tax code. That will allow Republicans to use a process known as budget reconciliation to pass tax cuts. Reconciliation only requires a simple majority to pass in the Senate and gives Democrats little opportunity to block Republicans’ tax cuts. Rep. Chris Collins ( ) told reporters that the plan is to ”‘have it on the president’s desk by the August recess.” But there was some disagreement about whether that was possible. According to Rep. Charlie Dent ( ) it was unclear if the plan was to have just the House finished up with tax reform or the Senate finished up with it as well.  The tax reform timeline sets out an aggressive agenda for the   Congress. Republicans also are hoping to be finished with repealing the Affordable Care Act by early March and that assumes that Republicans have put in place all of Trump’s cabinet nominees and other judicial appointments.  The congressional Republican retreat began Wednesday. Republicans had lunch and heard from the American Enterprise Institute’s director Arthur Brooks. Members then heard from both Ryan and McConnell about the upcoming agenda.

    "You can see the exact moment last week that Donald Trump made up his mind on whether women would face criminal punishment once he signed new restrictions into law. He is at a town hall with MSNBC’s Chris Matthews, and, after Matthews badgers him for a while, he finally answers the question. “The answer is . .. that,” Trump says, eyes looking to the side in thought, “there has to be some form of punishment. ” He punctuates “has” with a hand gesture. Done. Final.     But as it turns out  —   and as it has turned out repeatedly over the course of his life  —   that was not, in fact, Trump’s final position on the subject. This past week alone, he has held multiple contradicting positions, including that one. So we figured that a timeline was in order, so that you could see the date and time and know, concretely, what Trump’s abortion position was at that moment. Though he might deny it. April 1989 Trump   a dinner at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan (which he then owned) honoring Robin Chandler Duke, a former president of NARAL. He chose not to attend, the New York Times reported, after his family was threatened by   activists. Oct. 24, 1999 Ten years later, Trump appeared on NBC in an interview with Tim Russert. In a clip that has received newfound life during this election cycle, Trump defends his broadly liberal positions by explaining that he grew up in Manhattan, not Iowa. Asked about abortion, he’s clear.  “I’m very ” Trump says. “I hate the concept of abortion. I hate it. I hate everything it stands for. I cringe when I listen to people debating the subject. But you still  —   I just believe in choice. ” Russert clarifies his original point: Would you ban   abortion? “No,” Trump replies. Between 1999 and 2011 At some point between 1999 and 2011, Trump’s position on abortion changed. He explained the reason for his switch during the first debate of 2015. [W]hat happened is friends of mine years ago were going to have a child, and it was going to be aborted. And it wasn’t aborted. And that child today is a total superstar, a great, great child. And I saw that. And I saw other instances. In 2011, as he was toying with running, he told activists at the Conservative Political Action Conference that, among other conservative positions, “I am   [and] against gun control. ” June 28, 2015 Shortly after announcing his candidacy, Trump appeared on CNN in an interview with Jake Tapper. He got a little tripped up. TAPPER: Let me ask you about a few social issues because they haven’t been issues you have been talking about for several years. I know you’re opposed to abortion. TRUMP: Right. I’m  . TAPPER: You’re   or  ? TRUMP: I’m  . I’m sorry. March 30, 2016, 2:30 p. m. The interview with Matthews is taped, and Trump asserts that women who receive abortions once the procedure is illegal will face punishment. The men are involved will not, he adds. News of the comments quickly leaks. March 30, 2016, 3:30 p. m. Before the MSNBC town hall even airs, a spokesperson for Trump releases a statement changing what he told Matthews.   . @realDonaldTrump statement on abortion: says it should be put back to the states and he’s pro life, like Reagan. pic. twitter.   —   Ali Vitali (@alivitali) March 30, 2016  March 30, 2016, 5 p. m. About an hour later, Trump’s campaign releases a more formal “statement regarding abortion. ” It’s different than what he said to Matthews and his initial statement. “If Congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts upheld this legislation, or any state were permitted to ban abortion under state and federal law,” the statement says, “the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman. ” (It’s worth noting that this is in line with the   movement’s position.) The statement includes a snippet written in the first person: “My position has not changed  —   like Ronald Reagan, I am   with exceptions. ” April 1, 2016, 6:30 p. m. CBS releases an excerpt of its interview with Trump that aired Sunday morning. Asked again about abortion, Trump’s position seems to change yet again. “The laws are set now on abortion and that’s the way they’re going to remain until they’re changed,” he said, according to CBS’s transcript. “I would’ve preferred states’ rights. I think it would’ve been better if it were up to the states. But right now, the laws are set. ... At this moment, the laws are set. And I think we have to leave it that way. ” Understandably, this is not  . The   group Susan B. Anthony List replies that he had “disqualified himself as the GOP nominee” if this were his position. Trump also offered a reason for his initial comments to Matthews: “I’ve been told by some people that was an older line answer and that was an answer that was given on a, you know, basis of an older line from years ago on a very conservative basis. ” April 1, 2016, 9 p. m. Again before the program airs, the Trump campaign   what the candidate said. “Mr. Trump gave an accurate account of the law as it is today and made clear it must stay that way now  —   until he is president,” it read. “Then he will change the law through his judicial appointments and allow the states to protect the unborn. There is nothing new or different here. ” Should Mr. Trump’s position on abortion not be anything new or different again in the future, this article will be updated.

    "By my count I have helped some 58 friends (including many colleagues in public radio) buy a car. That’s sort of funny, considering I didn’t buy a car until I was 37 years old and began reporting on the auto industry for NPR. On Saturdays over the last few years, I have gotten phone calls from friends at car dealerships asking for advice. It’s no small financial matter, when the average cost of a new car is roughly $33, 000. So if you are reading this while in a car dealership, do what I tell all my friends: Stand up! Leave the dealership! Do not buy a car today! JOIN NPR’S ’YOUR MONEY AND YOUR LIFE’ FACEBOOK GROUP, And before you return, take a look at these tips I’ve gathered from industry experts and public radio friends. ”I knew exactly what I wanted,” Muthoni Muturi, NPR editor, Your father may have always loved Hondas, and your grandmother may have always bought Crown Victorias. But it’s my job to keep up with the car companies, and I have a hard time keeping track of what’s good or bad. (And it’s not your father’s Oldsmobile, because they don’t make Oldsmobiles anymore.) ”Information is king,” says Jonathan Collegio of the National Automobile Dealers Association, or NADA. ”Consumers should do as much homework as possible,” he says, and ”have a sense of the market.” They shouldn’t be afraid to go to a dealership, he says, but they should come prepared. Start with data: Consumer Reports has a list of the best and worst cars. Car company rankings change all the time, and you might be surprised at what you learn  —   for instance, that Audi, Subaru, Mazda and Buick all rate higher than Honda for reliability. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, or IIHS, compiles safety data by car and make. Both sites promise unbiased   information about car reliability and safety.  In addition, there are   sites that help with reviews and pricing of cars. Here are just a few: Cars. com, Truecar. com, Kelley Blue Book, CARFAX. com, Autotrader. com, Costco Auto and NADA Guides. Michelle Singletary, a personal finance columnist with The Washington Post, warns that consumers should not ”set one toe in the dealership” before doing their homework. ”Don’t be satisfied with going around the block,” Karen Grigsby Bates, NPR correspondent, Five or 10 years ago when you bought your last car you were that much younger. Your body, your needs and your eyesight have changed. That’s why a test drive is so important. Drive the car in the conditions you would use it in  —   at night on a dark road, for instance, so you can test the lights and brightness of interior lamps. Rebecca Lindland, a senior analyst with Kelley Blue Book, points out that a test drive can help with dealing with family members who have disabilities. She also recommends bringing car seats and pet carriers with you. And she reminds shorter drivers to pay attention to sightlines and especially the   (which is the beam on the windshield to the left of the driver) it can obscure vision around curves. She also advises   buyers to pay attention to something known as the  . ”When you stand next to the car with the door open, look at how high the top of the seat is. That’s called the    —   where the top of the seat is,” she says. Where the   falls will give you a sense of ease of entry. If the top of a seat hits below your knees, for instance, you’ll have to stoop lower to get into the car. If the   hits around   it will be was easier to get in and out. The key is to feel comfortable in the vehicle. ”A car is not an impulse purchase,” Sonari Glinton, NPR business correspondent, At its most basic, purchasing a car is a financial decision that’s tied with emotion, and dealers will use tactics that play on your emotions. I would suggest separating the different decisions.   on one day. Figure out financing on another. Determine the best dealer on yet another. ”Remember, their job is to sell you a car today,” says Jack Nerad, executive editorial director and executive market analyst with Kelley Blue Book and author of The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Buying or Leasing a Car. ”If you don’t like the experience of how they are treating you, leave,” Nerad advises. ”You have all the power. Use it. Walk out the door.” Dealers often will make you feel like the deal you’re getting is scarce, says Camelia Kuhnen, a neuroeconomist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. That will make you feel like you need to buy a car even if it’s against your best judgment. ”You can easily survive without that particular car, at this particular dealership,” she says. Bringing a friend who will be dispassionate about the whole process and help advocate on your behalf is a good idea, Kuhnen adds. ”I was prepared to walk out and did. It was only a couple hundred dollars difference but I got the deal I wanted,” Greg Dixon, NPR producer for All Things Considered  ”If you can’t pay cash for it, you need to be asking yourself why [you’re] buying this car,” says Singletary, the personal finance columnist. She suggests checking with your local bank or credit union before you go the dealership. ”Negotiate purchase price not the monthly payment,” says Lindland of Kelley Blue Book. ”You can easily spend hundreds, even thousands of extra dollars by not paying attention to terms.” One final tip from Lindland: Avoid car terms that are over 60 months. ”Longer term loans help keep monthly payments low,” says Melinda Zabritski with Experian, the credit agency. But consumers should be very careful, she says, because ”it’s easy to find yourself upside down . .. dealing with negative equity should they choose to trade it in after only a few years.” Collegio of NADA says ”it’s good to shop around.” He advises that you get a rate from your local bank  —   the dealer will be able to match or meet it. His organization has a guide for auto financing at autofinancing101. org. Ask for incentives. Dealers and carmakers often offer cash incentives, preferable loan or lease terms, gifts and even coupons to encourage consumers to buy cars. Check the manufacturer’s website for incentives, and be sure to ask your salesperson. The last weekend of the month is when dealers have the biggest incentive to sell. If you’re interested in leasing, negotiate the purchase price of the car first. Deal with the   separately, advises Singletary. Buy less car than you need, and think used (often referred to as  ) to get the best deal. Once you decide on the car, stick with the decision. ”Don’t settle on color,” warns Bates, who’s a member of NPR’s Code Switch team. ”Every time I go outside and see that red car, it makes me happy.” When you walk to your car, it should make you happy.

    "“The Legend of Tarzan” has a whole lot of fun,   things going for it  —   adventure, romance, natural landscapes, digital animals and oceans of rippling handsome  . Its sweep and easy pleasures come from its   escapades  —   it’s one long dash through the jungle by foot, train, boat and swinging vine  —   but what makes it more enjoyable than other recycled stories of this type is that the filmmakers have given Tarzan a thoughtful, imperfect makeover. That must have been tough given the origin story’s white supremacy problems. Tarzan has always had bad optics  —   white hero, black land  —   to state the excessively obvious. Probably the only real way to avoid his negative image would be to let him molder on the shelf and in our cultural memory. Except that this wild child raised by apes turned wild man forever caught between civilization and nature is a great mythic character  —   a rich, dense tangle of narrative, philosophical and political meanings. That partly explains why he’s been such a commercially reliable property since Edgar Rice Burroughs cut him loose in 1912, the year Tarzan roared into existence in a pulp magazine that evolved into an empire of books, comics, plays and films. The image of Alexander Skarsgard crashing   through the jungle as the latest   Tarzan, his long hair and   muscles gently fluttering, gets at another aspect of this character’s attraction. Like a lot of Tarzan stories, this one teems with striking flora and fauna, much of it skillfully computer generated, some of it captured on location in green, green Gabon. But its most special and spectacular effect is Tarzan, one of those characters who have always complicated the familiar argument that visual pleasure in Hollywood cinema is hinged on women being objects of male desire. Johnny Weissmuller, the most famous screen Tarzan, was an exemplary fetishized object of desire. The casting of Mr. Skarsgard, who spent a lot of time baring his body, along with vampire fangs, on the HBO show “True Blood,” indicates that the filmmakers understand a primal part of Tarzan’s allure. This isn’t strictly a question of Mr. Skarsgard’s considerable physical charms, though these are central to the character. (He isn’t playing nerd boy of the jungle.) Mr. Skarsgard is also a fine actor with an enigmatic melancholy, a quality that has been put to expressive use in small roles in movies like “What Maisie Knew” and that here suggests Tarzan carries a profound burden that makes him more complex than the usual beefcake in loincloth. And Tarzan needs a burden, something heavy enough to justify the exhumation of such a difficult fantasy figure. He gets one by proxy in “The Legend of Tarzan,” which opens with some historically informed text about King Leopold II of Belgium ( ) known as the butcher of Congo for his role in murdering millions. It’s a grim start to this   but the mood lifts at Greystoke Manor, Tarzan’s ancestral pad in Britain, where he’s broodily prowling about like a caged animal. Already married to Lady Jane (Margot Robbie, holding her own) Tarzan now goes by John Clayton, having years earlier returned to nominal civilization and its discontents. Directed by David Yates, from an     script by Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer, “The Legend of Tarzan” takes a while to get going. After announcing its grave bona fides, it continues to engage in a lot of narrative throat clearing, much of it dedicated to seeding Burroughs’s foundational story with historical facts. To this end, John receives an invitation from King Leopold to return to Congo to witness the king’s putative good works. John rejects the offer, only to change his mind after an entreaty from an American, George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) who suspects that the Belgian king is enslaving the region’s people. Mr. Jackson’s character is very loosely based on an extraordinary real historical hero named George Washington Williams, who occupies a chapter in Adam Hochschild’s magisterial book “King Leopold’s Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror and Heroism in Colonial Africa. ” Mr. Hochschild writes that Williams, whom he calls “the first heretic,” was the earliest dissenter to speak out “fully and passionately and repeatedly” on Leopold’s atrocities. Williams deserves a grand cinematic adventure of his own, and perhaps Mr. Jackson’s comfortable, affable performance, which like the movie itself oscillates between seriousness and gentle comedy, will help make that case. Here, though, Williams is basically an elevated sidekick as well as a physician, war veteran and crack shot who’s as proficient at suturing wounds with insects as he is mowing down swaths of white mercenaries. More interesting, especially given how routine colonialist fantasies tend to play out, it is Williams who voices the complexities, catastrophic errors and redemptive efforts of the   civilized world, a screen job usually given to white saviors. Williams’s polar opposite is the resident villain, Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz, predictably good) a silky, uncomplicated sadist who embodies rapacious evil from his   suit to his crosslike weapon. Tarzan remains the man apart and the man in the middle, the uneasy, sometimes forlorn, sometimes exuberant bridge between civilization and nature, between the human and nonhuman animal world. His origin story from his cradle to his new mother’s hairy arms is related in flashback patchwork that conveys what he lost when he left the jungle  —   home, world and identity. And when he at last returns to that home, he has much to do, including nuzzle old furred friends and lead a rescue mission that soon involves Jane along with thousands of Africans. Jane scoffs at the word damsel, but she’s in distress as well as a   for the abused, captive black bodies that the movie shows only glancingly. Mr. Yates, who directed the last four movies in the “Harry Potter” franchise, slips easily between intimacy and grandiosity, and he scales up and scales down as easily as Tarzan scrambles up and down the digitally rendered trees. If he and his team haven’t reinvented Tarzan it’s because they’re working in an industrial context that still puts a premium on heroic white men, even if this one doesn’t make you wince each time he turns up. Tarzan is still the white avatar flying through the African jungle with eerie skills, a mighty yodel and existential issues, yet the terrain he swings over is messier, closer and less of a lie than it once was. Part of Tarzan’s appeal  —   at least to some  —   is that he inhabits a world that resembles ours, but without the unsettling distractions of real suffering. It’s become trickier for pop entertainments to gloss over historical traumas, which may be why so many modern colonial struggles involve deep space or an alien invasion. Perhaps it’s easier to rewrite history through futuristic fictions, where worlds can collide before everyone moves on. There’s something touching about “The Legend of Tarzan,” which as it struggles to offer old   adventure without old   racism, suggests that perhaps other fantasies are possible  —   you just need some thought and Mr. Jackson. “The Legend of Tarzan” is rated   (Parents strongly cautioned). It’s a Tarzan movie! Running time:  1 hour 49 minutes.": "24997",
    "The third time’s the charm for studio chieftain Jeffrey Katzenberg. Comcast’s NBCUniversal confirmed on Thursday it is buying   DreamWorks Animation for $3. 8 billion in cash, or $41 a share. The deal comes after two misses for Katzenberg’s studio. Japanese telecom giant Softbank and toy maker Hasbro were rumored at different times to have been interested in acquiring DreamWorks Animation only to have leaks scuttle the talks. The acquisition will see DreamWorks Animation become part of NBCU’s Universal Filmed Entertainment Group and will be led by Chris Meledandri, the current chief of animation unit Illumination, which is behind “Minions” and “Despicable Me. ” Katzenberg  —   who had angled to remain in a leadership position in talks with previous suitors  —   will step aside and be an adviser to the firm. He will also become chairman of DreamWorks New Media, which will house the digital media outfit AwesomenessTV, which is   by Verizon and Hearst. Shares of DreamWorks Animation were up more than 24 percent to $39. 97 in afternoon trading. The pending acquisition and speculation of further consolidation also boosted shares of Lionsgate, the last independent studio of any size. Lionsgate rose 7. 43 percent to $22. 27.": "142477",
    "Attorney General Jeff Sessions sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee Monday to ”supplement” testimony given during his confirmation hearings in January, in which he said “I did not have communications with the Russians. ” In fact, Sessions met twice with the Russian ambassador to the United States during the 2016 presidential campaign, despite denying any contact to Sen. Al Franken ( ) during his confirmation hearings. Sessions said in a press conference last Thursday that he had “focused my answer on” a breaking news story mentioned by Franken that members of Trump’s campaign had had repeated contact with Russian nationals, including intelligence officials, during the campaign, “My reply to the question of Sen. Franken was honest and correct as I understood it at the time,” Sessions said Thursday, before adding: “I will write the Judiciary Committee soon  —   today or tomorrow  —   to explain this testimony for the record. ”  Four days later, the letter arrived.  “I did not mention communications I had had with the Russian Ambassador over the years because the question did not ask about them,” Sessions wrote in it, referring to his response to Franken’s question.  “I do not recall any discussions with the Russian Ambassador, or any other representative of the Russian government, regarding the political campaign on these occasions or any other occasions,” he added later. Sessions also responded in the letter to Democrats on the Judiciary Committee who demanded to know why, when he recused himself  from “matters that deal with the Trump campaign” during the Thursday press conference, Sessions didn’t also recuse himself from matters related to “Russian contacts with the Trump transition team and administration. ” “I understood the scope of the recusal as described in the Department’s press release would include any such matters,” Sessions wrote in response.

    "”This storm is a monster,” Gov. Rick Scott said at an evening news conference. ”Matthew is likely to produce devastating impacts along portions of the east coast tonight,” he added. As it moved north in the evening, Matthew stayed about 100 miles or more off South Florida, sparing the 4. 4 million people in the Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas from its most punishing effects.  ”We were lucky this time,”   Mayor Carlos Gimenez said. By Thursday night, more than 60, 000 homes and businesses were without power. Streets in Vero Beach were partially covered with water, and hotel guests in Orlando were told to stay inside, though a few sneaked out to smoke or watch the rain. The hurricane was instead expected to blow ashore    or come dangerously close to doing so    early Friday north of West Palm Beach, which has about 1. 1 million people, and then slowly push north for the next 12 hours along the Interstate 95 corridor, through Cape Canaveral and Jacksonville, according to the National Hurricane Center. Forecasters said it would then probably hug the coast of Georgia and South Carolina over the weekend before veering out to sea    perhaps even looping back toward Florida in the middle of next week as a tropical storm. As of 10 p. m. EDT, Matthew was located 65 miles   of West Palm Beach, moving northwest at about 13 mph. As evening fell, the winds picked up along Vero Beach, midway between West Palm Beach and Cape Canaveral, stripping away palm fronds, ripping awnings and blowing sand that stung the face. Waves crashed on the beach, and rain came in short bursts. About 30, 000 homes and businesses were in the dark.  Officials from Florida to South Carolina urged an estimated 2 million people to evacuate. Scott said so far he has activated 3, 500 Florida National Guard members to assist in any rescues and recovery missions after the storm passed.  CLICK FOR INFORMATION ON CURRENT FLORIDA EVACUATION ORDERS, President Obama declared a state of emergency for Florida and South Carolina on Thursday, clearing the way for federal aid in addition to state and local emergency response teams. The Pentagon reported the governors of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina had mobilized 4, 500 National Guardsmen ahead of the hurricane. Forecasters said Matthew could dump up to 15 inches of rain in some spots and cause a storm surge of 9 feet or more. They said the major threat to the Southeast would not be the winds    which newer buildings can withstand    but the massive surge of seawater that could wash over coastal communities along a   stretch from South Florida to the Charleston, S. C. area.  The Fort Lauderdale airport shut down on Thursday morning, and further north the Orlando airport also closed. By     service FlightAware. com reported that nearly 1, 500 flights within the U. S. had been scrapped, with the largest numbers at Fort Lauderdale and Miami. American Airlines, which has a major hub in Miami, was the   carrier, followed by Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways. Amtrak suspended train service between Miami and New York, and cruise lines rerouted ships to avoid the storm, which in some cases will mean more days at sea. Workers transferred patients from two Florida waterfront hospitals and a nursing home near Daytona Beach to safer locations. Officials at Walt Disney World, Universal Studios and SeaWorld said the parks would shut down Thursday afternoon until the storm passes. Thousands of people hunkered down in schools converted to shelters, and inland hotels in places such as Charlotte, N. C. reported brisk business.  At the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, NASA no longer has to worry about rolling space shuttles back from the launch pad to the hangar because of hurricanes, since the shuttle fleet is now retired. But the spaceflight company SpaceX was concerned about the storm’s effect on its leased seaside pad. ”When a hurricane is forecast to take a track roughly parallel to a coastline, as Matthew is forecast to do from Florida through South Carolina, it becomes very difficult to specify impacts at any one location,” National Hurricane Center forecaster Lixion Avila said. The number of people killed in Haiti rose to at least 283, local officials told Reuters on Thursday, saying the storm killed at least four people elsewhere in the Caribbean. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal ordered an evacuation of the state’s entire coast, covering more than a   people. It was the first hurricane evacuation along the Georgia coast since 1999, when the state narrowly escaped Floyd.  The last Category 3 storm or higher to hit the U. S. was Wilma in October 2005. It sliced across Florida with 120 mph winds, killing five people and causing an estimated $21 billion in damage. As people hurried to higher ground, authorities in South Carolina said a motorist died on Wednesday after being shot by deputies in a gun battle that erupted when he sped away from a checkpoint along an evacuation route.  South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley reversed Interstate 26 so that all lanes of traffic were headed west and out of Charleston. It was the first time the lanes had been reversed. Plans to reverse the lanes were put in place after   traffic jams during Hurricane Floyd in 1999. Haley said Thursday night she’s ”begging” people to understand the seriousness of Matthew and evacuate the South Carolina coast. Haley said so far 280, 000 people had evacuated as of 3 p. m. Thursday, but that means hundreds of thousands more need to leave. The governor told reporters that forecasts are getting worse, but ”we can’t take you by the hand and bring you to the Upstate.” Medical facilities that have had to evacuate their patients include Beaufort Memorial Hospital. Haley said Thursday night that should be an indication of the seriousness. Authorities said the storm surge in some areas along the southern coast of South Carolina will exceed those when Hurricane Hugo hit the state in 1989. Haley said to ”imagine   ” storm surges, while eastern parts of the state could see 8 to 14 inches of rain. In Florida, Scott also lifted tolls on major roads. The Florida Turnpike, Alligator Alley and part of the Central Florida Expressway Authority and the   Expressway Authority had toll services suspended, according to Fox 35 Orlando. In Melbourne Beach, near the Kennedy Space Center, Carlos and April Medina moved their paddle board and kayak inside the garage and took pictures off the walls of their home about 500 feet from the coast. They moved the pool furniture inside, turned off the water, disconnected all electrical appliances and emptied their refrigerator. They then hopped in a truck filled with legal documents, jewelry and a decorative carved shell that had once belonged to April Medina’s   and headed west to Orlando, where they planned to ride out the storm with their daughter’s family. ”The way we see it, if it maintains its current path, we get tropical   winds. If it makes a little shift to the left, it could be a Category 2 or 3 and I don’t want to be anywhere near it,” Carlos Medina said. ”We are just being a little safe, a little bit more cautious.” About 20 miles away in the town of Cape Canaveral, John Long said Hurricane Matthew is just hype as his neighbors in his RV park packed up and evacuated inland. Even though his   RV is just feet from the Banana River and a half mile from the beach, he had no plans to leave. Long, who owns a bike shop and has lived along the Space Coast for 30 years, said he has a generator and enough food and water for himself and his cats to last a week. ”There’s always tremendous buildup and then it’s no stronger than an afternoon thunderstorm,” he said. ”I’m not anticipating that much damage.” At Folly Beach, S. C. southwest of Charleston, Gaby Trompeter loaded her car at her beachfront home preparing to evacuate to Augusta, Georgia. Trompeter, a    goldsmith who designs and makes jewelry, remembers Hurricane Hugo when she stayed in Savannah, Georgia, in 1989. A year ago when what has been described as a   flood inundated South Carolina there was so much water on the road near her house she couldn’t get out for three days. ”If it brings a lot of rain, more than the storm last year, why would I want to stay?” she said. On the Georgia coast,    Lou Arcangeli saw two of his adult children come to his home on Tybee Island to help prepare and evacuate if necessary. ”It’s serious,” said Arcangeli, who has lived in the Savannah area since 1979, when Hurricane David became the last hurricane to make landfall on Georgia’s   coast. ”I’m going to keep an eye on it and not wait until the last minute. As far as I’m concerned, what’s going to happen is going to happen.” ”We have a house that sits right here on the water and we kind of said goodbye to it thinking that, you know, the house . .. might not be here when we get back,” said Jennifer Banker, a resident of Georgia’s dangerously exposed St. Simons Island. ”You know, we pray a lot and trust God to provide.” Some coastal residents in Georgia and beyond decided to take their chances and stay. Darcy O’Connor, a restaurant owner who lives in a rowhouse in Savannah, Ga. a historic city of many beautifully maintained homes from the 18th and 19th century, said she and her most of her neighbors were sticking around. O’Connor noted that her home, built in 1883, has weathered hurricanes before: ”Half the windows, if you look, still have the original glass. So that tells you something.” Farmers in Matthew’s path scrambled to protect their crops. In South Carolina, Jeremy Cannon was harvesting his soybeans a week early after waiting too long before last year’s record rainstorm. He watched his soybeans and cotton crops slowly drown as 20 inches of rain fell, costing him $800, 000. ”I don’t want to lose a single soybean this year if I don’t have to,” Cannon said. ”The Lord says pray without ceasing. And that’s what I’ve been doing  —   in the fields, near the barn  —   just praying all the time. I don’t want to find out what I’ll have to do if I get wiped out for another year.” Fox News’ Kathleen Foster, Lucas Tomlinson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.": "86290",
    "U. S. President Barack Obama’s foreign policy legacy rests in part on a foundation of unilateral actions that his successor Donald Trump could reverse with the stroke of a pen. Due to take office on Jan. 20, Trump, the winner in Tuesday’s election, campaigned at times to dismantle Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran and to reimpose sanctions Obama eased on Cuba. Trump also disagreed with foreign policy decisions that included the way Obama has deployed troops abroad to combat Islamist militant groups. In his most notable foreign policy achievements, Obama, a Democrat, used executive authorities that offered a convenient legal path around a   Congress committed to blocking his agenda. The U. S. Constitution gives a president broad executive powers to enact foreign policy. Both Republican and Democratic presidents have sought to exercise those powers by issuing executive orders, presidential memoranda and what are called findings. ”He (Obama) relied on executive authority to build a foreign policy legacy,” said Thomas Wright, director of the Project on International Order and Strategy at the Brookings Institution.  ”That is all vulnerable to countervailing executive authority by a Trump administration,” Wright said. Obama had hoped to pass his legacy on to Democrat Hillary Clinton, his former secretary of state, but she lost the presidential election to Trump, a Republican businessman who has never held public office or served in the military.  TRUMP PLANS UNCLEAR Often contradicting himself during the campaign, Trump made it difficult to know for sure what policies he would pursue. Major constraints include budget caps, laws he cannot reverse without Congress, and the pressure that will emerge to replace policies he chooses to abandon. Trump said in an October speech that he would ”cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama” on his first day in office, without saying who would determine their constitutionality. A Trump spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday on his latest plans. EXECUTIVE ORDERS, ENACTED & RESCINDED Perhaps nowhere has Obama faced more congressional opposition than in his pursuit of the 2015 deal with Iran, which Republicans and some Democrats said put too few restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program in return for too much sanctions relief. Trump has vowed to dismantle it, although his statements on the deal have been contradictory. A president may tighten and relax economic sanctions by executive order. ”Anything enacted by executive order can be rescinded by executive order,” said Zachary Goldman, a former U. S. Treasury official now at New York University. Obama drew enough support from Democrats to block a   resolution rejecting the Iran deal, achieving a political victory but falling short of a consensus.  Trump will have the added advantage of working with a U. S. Senate and a House of Representatives controlled by fellow Republicans. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said on Wednesday he hoped Trump would ”see how much he can undo the unilateral actions the president took all by himself, which would not require us.” CUBA, DRONES Breaking with longstanding U. S. policy on another issue, Obama restored diplomatic ties with Cuba in 2015. But facing opposition in Congress to lifting a broad economic embargo, especially from Republicans, he used executive actions to ease some U. S. sanctions. Obama capped his Cuba efforts last month with a sweeping  ”presidential policy directive,” which also is reversible and sets forth mandates for government engagement,    exchanges, and greater U. S. business ties. Trump has taken contradictory positions on whether he supports the embargo or not. Obama’s aides said the easing of restrictions was aimed at securing enough benefits for U. S. businesses and travelers that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for any Republican president to reverse the opening to Cuba. Trump could roll back Obama’s efforts to create greater transparency about drone strikes. Obama issued an executive order in July requiring annual disclosures about such strikes. MILITARY POWER As    Trump will wield the power to mobilize the U. S. military on short notice and without first seeking approval from Congress. Obama deployed U. S. troops to Iraq, Syria and Libya to help fight the Islamic State militant group by relying on the authority Congress granted President George W. Bush to battle al Qaeda. That same authority would allow Trump to ramp up U. S. deployments in fights against Islamist militants if he chose to do so. One former U. S. intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the president can approve covert action and needs only to brief relevant leaders in Congress once the operation is under way. Trump’s powers, however, are limited. He pledged to expand the Army, grow the Marine Corps, boost the Navy from 276 to 350 ships and submarines, and raise the number of Air Force tactical aircraft from 1, 100 to 1, 200. For starters, that would require that Congress scrap government spending caps under the Budget Control Act. Trump’s support for   an interrogation technique that simulates drowning, also would meet opposition. Congress last year passed legislation barring the use of waterboarding and other ”extreme interrogation techniques” widely considered torture. Obama signed the measure into law last November.

    "When I was a kid, “Quantum Leap” was one of my favorite TV shows. Its conceit was ludicrous, but in a way that allowed for maximum entertainment: A   experiment gone awry forces the handsome Dr. Sam Beckett to “leap” among different bodies at various points in history. Each episode began with Beckett waking up in a new situation and piecing together the mystery of his surroundings. The show didn’t shy away from serious themes: In one, he wakes up in the body of a woman who has just been raped in another, he wakes up in the body of a black man in Alabama in the 1950s. “Quantum Leap” has stayed with me all these years, I think, because it offered my young, impressionable mind a framework for normal travel. Arriving in a new place  —   even if it’s in the same dimension  —   can be disjointing and chaotic, because each new destination is governed by an invisible set of rules. Traditional guidebooks have never quite done it for me. Too often they seem to be aimed at a certain type of comfortable,   traveler. And I happen to know intimately that the authors weren’t always the most informed: One of my first paid writing jobs was for a   company, where I penned florid prose about sea turtles in Costa Rica a full three years before I ever set foot in the country. The rise of the social web promised a new era of personalization for  . But like many things born online, as popularity of the new tools increased, efficiency and usefulness began to decrease. Brands and businesses quickly set to figuring out how to manipulate and game the services, and they soon succeeded. Yelp, for example, lost credibility after it was revealed that businesses solicited people to write fake reviews. Foursquare’s recommendations were initially a wealth of insider tips, but advertisers often bought their way into the recommendations, giving chains priority over local businesses. TripAdvisor has a slightly different problem: Its ambit is so broad that its recommendations have come to represent a safe median, a poll of polls. It’s great for making sure a restaurant you want to eat in won’t give you dysentery, but less so for identifying adventures or local secrets. Each of these shortcomings is different, but they amount to the same problem: These tools have come to replicate the biases and generic quality of the     travel guides they were meant to replace. And as the vis ual web matured, this problem seemed to be replicating itself yet again. Tourist boards flew popular Instagrammers to their idyllic locations and paid them to post impossibly stunning photographs to attract other world trekkers. Locations that may have once been hidden gems, like New Zealand’s South Island, became hot spots  —   a boon for the local economy but bad for reliable reviews. When people talk about how the internet has changed the way we travel, they typically lament the way our compulsion to document removes us, somehow, from the actual experience. In an article for Backchannel on Medium earlier this year called “Instagram Is Ruining Vacation,” Mary Pilon wrote about   dependency and how the “fight for the perfect Instagram” was influencing where  —   and how  —   people decided to spend their time. “At times, it felt like destinations were morphing into mere photo sets,” she writes about tourist behavior on a trip to Angkor Wat. But that same urge to share has created what is, for me, the best travel resource on the web: using   searches on   apps, especially Insta gram, to drop in, like Dr. Beckett, to different destinations. Looking at the raw feed of geotagged posts offers a graphic map in real time, which you can comb through to make your own guidebook. I like to think of it as akin to a surf cam. But instead of tuning in to see if the waves are too mushy, feeds give a feel for a place that you can use to decide if a place feels fun and seems safe  —   whatever that means to you. And this has become my compass, my way of navigating the world. Rather than obsessing over travel sites or print guides or bothering friends for recommendations, I check a new city or town’s location tag right before I get there and see which recent posts are most popular. What I see there is wildly unfiltered, refracted through multiple perspectives  —   and much more revealing than any other guide. Before I went to Senegal in March, I spent two days watching the location tags for Gorée Island, a landmark famous for its horrible history. It was there that captured Africans were imprisoned before being shipped to the Americas to be sold into slavery. The feed on the Gorée Island location tag was cluttered with tourists’ selfies. Worried that such cluelessness would ruin the experience and heighten the impact of the island’s historical trauma, I decided to see the island some other time and have dinner with a friend and her family at their home instead. This approach also affords a window into cultural insights I might not get other wise. The year before, in Morocco, a group of friends and I were unsure how best to dress when walking around a small town outside Tangier  —   we wanted to be especially respectful because we were visiting during Ramadan  —   so we browsed local Instagram posts until we had a sense of what was appropriate. In Puerto Rico, I was eager to experience the   culture, so I scanned tags on Instagram until I sighted brown and black bodies in the location tag for Piñones, a beach outpost where families swim in the sea and vendors sell cold coconuts and alcapurrias, fritters stuffed with crab and cheese. It was one of the highlights of the trip. Just about any app with geolocation will do each, in its own way, offers you direct access to locals and fellow travelers alike. While on an extended trip in Norway, and desperate for nonnative Norwegians to meet, I prowled and posted on Yik Yak in Oslo to try to figure out where young brown people hung out. In Cape Cod, I used Her  —   a dating app  —   to look into where young lesbians gathered in   Provincetown. These apps can also work in unexpected ways, specifically to avoid harm and danger: In Dakar, my friend and I received warnings via Grindr about inquiring openly about gay bars and hangouts, as homosexuality is still illegal in Senegal. A few months later, back home in New York, in an effort to safely celebrate Pride in the aftermath of the shootings in Orlando at Pulse, these   samplings were crucial for determining the temperature of gay events around the city. Lately, I’ve been thinking about these   uses through another lens. In the early 20th century, segregation and racial hostility meant that traveling while black in America was an extremely dangerous affair. In 1936, a Harlem postal worker named Victor Green published a booklet called “The Negro Motorist Green Book,” or just “The Green Book,” comprising information he and other postal workers had gathered along their routes about establishments that would welcome black travelers. The book became less relevant by the  ’60s, as the rise of the civil rights movement and the fight for equal access diminished the popularity of the Jim Crow staple. But even as laws and culture have changed, the rules are still not the same for everyone in America, or the world. The reality is that we all move through the world subject to subtly different forces and dynamics.

    "POINT JUDITH, R. I.  —   There was a time when whiting were plentiful in the waters of Rhode Island Sound, and Christopher Brown pulled the fish into his long stern trawler by the bucketful. “We used to come right here and catch two, three, four thousand pounds a day, sometimes 10,” he said, sitting at the wheel of the Proud Mary  —   a   named, he said, after his wife, not the Creedence Clearwater Revival song  —   as it cruised out to sea. But like many other fish on the Atlantic Coast, whiting have moved north, seeking cooler waters as ocean temperatures have risen, and they are now filling the nets of fishermen farther up the coast. Studies have found that   of marine species in the Northeast United States have shifted or extended their range as a result of ocean warming, migrating northward or outward into deeper and cooler water. Lobster, once a staple in southern New England, have decamped to Maine. Black sea bass, scup, yellowtail flounder, mackerel, herring and monkfish, to name just a few species, have all moved to accommodate changing temperatures. Yet fishing regulations, which among other things set legal catch limits for fishermen and are often based on where fish have been most abundant in the past, have failed to keep up with these geographical changes. The center of the black sea bass population, for example, is now in New Jersey, hundreds of miles north of where it was in the 1990s, providing the basis for regulators to distribute shares of the catch to the Atlantic states. Under those rules, North Carolina still has rights to the largest share. The result is a convoluted workaround many fishermen view as nonsensical. Because black sea bass are now harder to find in their state waters, North Carolina fishermen must steam north 10 hours, to where the fish are abundant, to even approach the state’s allocation. Mr. Brown and other New England fishermen, however, whose states have much smaller shares, can legally land only a small fraction of the black sea bass they catch and must throw the rest overboard. And New England states like Maine, where fishermen are beginning to catch black sea bass regularly, have only a tiny allocation and no established fishery. “Our management system assumes that the ocean has white lines drawn on it, but fish don’t see those lines,” said Malin L. Pinsky, an assistant professor in the department of ecology, evolution and natural resources at Rutgers University, who studies how marine species adapt to climate change. “And our management system is not as nimble as the fish. ” The mismatch between the location of fish and the rules for catching them has pitted recreational fishermen against commercial ones and state against state. It has heightened tensions among fishermen, government regulators and the scientists who advise them and raised questions for fishery managers that have no easy answers. Reflecting these tensions, Senators Richard Blumenthal and Christopher S. Murphy, both Democrats of Connecticut, noted in a letter to the acting inspector general of the Commerce Department in June that fishermen in their state were experiencing “extreme financial hardship” because the apportionment of resources was so outdated. “We request that your office investigate how the current system impacts the region’s fishermen and whether the structure should be reformed to bring quota allocations in line with current data on actual fish population distribution,” the senators, joined by Representative Joe Courtney, also a Democrat of Connecticut, wrote. “As species of fish move north, the allocation levels should migrate with them. ” Although such shifts in allocations are possible, said Tom Nies, the executive director of the New England Fishery Management Council, in practice they are difficult to execute. “If you’re giving fish to somebody, you’re taking them away from somebody else,” Mr. Nies said. But, he added, fishery managers at state and federal levels are examining ways to take into account the effects of warming ocean temperatures. Those approaches include changes in how permits are structured and giving states with nascent fisheries representation in councils that oversee states where the fish are  . “I would be surprised if you find very many fishermen who will tell you that climate change is not happening,” he said. “I think there’s a clear recognition from everybody that this is a problem, and a lot of people are working on how to address it. ” One approach being actively pursued by scientists and managers is developing methods to incorporate temperature data and other characteristics of the environment into the surveys that regulators use to set fishing quotas. Richard J. Seagraves, the senior scientist for the   Fishery Management Council, said that in a series of surveys distributed and town   meetings held by the council, “the most pressing concern expressed by all parties was the failure to address ecosystem considerations, like a changing climate and the physical effects on fish stocks. ” The government periodically monitors fish species to see if they are thriving or at risk of extinction. The surveys are intended to determine how much fishing a given species can sustain, in order to avoid overfishing. But even in the best case, trying to estimate the size of fish populations is an uncertain proposition. And the migration of species in response to warming temperatures has made the task considerably harder. “From a scientific perspective, there are some really interesting questions,” Dr. Pinsky said. “Where did the fish go? Did we eat them? Or did they go somewhere else? Those are questions we haven’t really had to grapple with. ” A 2014 survey of butterfish  —   a small, silvery fish that provides food for many larger fish species and is popular in Japan  —   illustrated the problem with traditional assessment methods. A previous survey of butterfish had been unsuccessful at figuring out how robust the population was  —   there was too much uncertainty in the assessment’s sampling of the fish. Because regulators could not make a judgment about the status of the species, butterfish fishing was temporarily suspended. But when a team of scientists began talking to fishermen, they realized that the earlier survey had not taken into account the movements of the butterfish in response to changes in water temperature. “What we learned from working with the fishermen was that the animals were probably occurring outside the survey,” John A. Manderson, a research biologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s northeast fisheries science center. Dr. Manderson and his colleagues developed a way to factor movement patterns and temperature shifts into models for assessing the fish. Once their work was incorporated into the next survey, which found that butterfish were still plentiful, the fishery reopened. Dr. Manderson said that listening to fishermen, who are often in the best position to know how many fish there are and where they are, was the key to understanding what was occurring. “What started out as an academic exercise turned into a collaborative one,” Dr. Manderson said. Yet it remains difficult to tease apart how much of the dip in a fish population is a result of climate change and how much is a result of overfishing, or even of a natural fluctuation in population numbers from year to year. “I think you’ve got to be careful when you react to these things,” Mr. Nies, of the New England fishery council, said. “You want to make sure you’re reacting to a signal and not to noise. ” He noted that there had been cases where regulators incorrectly concluded that a species had collapsed, citing the haddock population in the  . “Here we are 20 years later and we’ve got more Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank haddock than has ever been detected in the last 100 years,” he said. A growing number of scientists and managers favor moving eventually to what they call   management, a system that is focused on the environmental niche a species occupies, rather than individual species themselves. Under such a system, regulation would be aimed at making sure that there are enough fish available to maintain an ecological balance of predators and prey, and quotas might be based on a category of marine species, rather than specific fish. The West Coast has already adopted some version of this approach in the north Pacific, setting an overall quota for groundfish caught in the Bering Sea. Temperature affects fish species differently. “Climate change is going to make it hard on some of those species that are not particularly fond of warm or warming waters,” said Mr. Brown, who is the president of the Rhode Island Commercial Fishermen’s Association, a trade group. “But as the impacts of climate change descend upon us, there are also species that are going to be victorious, hugely victorious. ” Yet the changes are happening so fast that regulators will have to adapt quickly if they are to have any hope of keeping up. Marine species, Dr. Manderson said, are moving north at 10 times the rate of animals on land. “Our ideas of property rights and laws are purely ” he said. “But the ocean is all about flux and turbulence and movement. ” He added, “Even the science is too slow. ”": "24817",
    "China threatened to “take off the gloves” if   Donald Trump keeps needling Beijing, the country’s   media reported Monday. Trump suggested Friday that the longtime US policy of recognizing one China to exclude Taiwan is up for negotiation. China is already livid with Trump for   the first time an American president or   has publicly acknowledged chatting with Taiwan’s leader in nearly 40 years. “If Trump is determined to use this gambit on taking office, a period of fierce, damaging interactions will be unavoidable, as Beijing will have no choice but to take off the gloves,”  It accused the   of “playing with fire. ” China’s Global Times, which is also     as well, calling him “inexperienced” and “complacent,” and warned the   against using the “trump” card of Taiwan as he shakes up American foreign policy. “In the past, Trump infuriated us, but now we find him risible. With a skyrocketing ascent in his political life, he has been stunningly confident in his ostensible knowledge of the job, though he speaks like a rookie,” the newspaper said. The country’s foreign ministry also cautioned Trump against trying to use Taiwan’s status as a bargaining chip. “Not everything in the world can be bargained or traded off,” ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunyingb said. “Whoever attempts to harm the   principle out of any motive or uses the principle as a bargaining chip will definitely be facing broad and strong opposition from the Chinese government and people, as well as the international community,” Hua said.

    "Uber Technologies Inc said on Thursday it plans to comply with California regulations and seek permits to put its   cars back on the state’s roads, an   following the company’s legal spat with state officials in December. Two of Uber’s autonomous cars are already wheeling around San Francisco, but they are being driven manually while the company is ”taking steps to complete our application to apply for a DMV testing permit,” an Uber spokeswoman said. The California’s Department of Motor Vehicles confirmed it has held discussions with Uber to assist the company in applying for the   testing permit. Uber has not formally submitted the application, DMV spokeswoman Jessica Gonzalez said. Acquiring the proper permit would allow Uber to restart its   pilot in San Francisco, which was shuttered after just a week late last year. The state DMV requires that any company testing autonomous vehicles on public roads receive a permit. At least 23 other companies exploring   cars, including Alphabet’s GOOG. O. Google, Tesla Motors ( ) and Ford Motor Co ( ) have obtained California DMV permits. But Uber defied those rules in December, attempting to launch a   pilot program in San Francisco without a permit. Uber argued that its cars were not capable of driving ”without . .. active physical control or monitoring,” as California law defines autonomous vehicles, so did not require a permit. Uber’s cars require monitoring by a person in the driver’s seat. An engineer also sits in the passenger seat.  The pilot was  . The DMV revoked the registration of 16 Uber   cars for lacking the proper permits a week after Uber put them on the road. The California Attorney General also warned Uber it would take legal action.

    "Jaipur, India (CNN) With just three words, Farha, a   old woman from the northern Indian city of Jaipur, became a single mother of three young children.  Farha’s husband instantly divorced her last year by saying ”talaq, talaq, talaq” in a fit of anger after their    daughter had asked him for five rupees (seven cents) to buy some firecrackers for a holiday celebration. Triple talaq, as it is commonly called, is an ancient and controversial Islamic practice where a man divorces a woman by saying the word talaq, the Arabic word for divorce, three times. Sometimes, it’s even delivered by phone or text message.  In theory, it should take three months to take effect. In practice, it is often instantaneous    the woman forced out of the house with barely a moment’s notice.  India, home to the second largest Muslim population in the world, is among the few that do not ban the practice. Other countries with majority Muslim populations like Pakistan and Indonesia have outlawed the practice for years.  Will it be banned? Yet this could soon change    a move that would be a victory for Farha and others like her.  The nation’s highest legal advisory body, the Law Commission of India, put out a survey to Indian citizens in October 2016, asking about various ways to reform family laws and specifically whether or not to ban talaq.  India’s Supreme Court plans to constitute a   bench to rule on the issue of whether talaq and other practices are un constitutional. It has asked all of the involved parties to submit their evidence in support of their petitions by March 30.  ”In a Muslim society which practices talaq, women have no existence,” says Farha, who adheres to the local custom of only using one name. ”A man can leave a woman at any time because of any issue.” Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA)    a network of Muslim women activists and organizations that operate in 15 states in the country     is leading a nationwide campaign against talaq. Its headquarters in Jaipur    known to tourists as India’s Pink City     is located in a dilapidated building in one of the city’s back alleys, which stand in sharp contrast to the decorated rose sandstone for which the city is a famed. It’s a one room office, barely six feet wide. Plastic chairs line both sides of the room. It is here that Farha came to seek help. They have long worked with women like Farha who have been abandoned by their husbands, by helping them file cases with the police or by providing basic necessities.  They aren’t advocating the complete erasure of the practice from Islam, but argue that because of the way talaq has been practiced, women need some form of legal recourse when they currently have none. ’Monstrosity’ In the last few years, the campaign has picked up momentum.  In 2016, a judge in a   court called the practice a ”monstrosity,” going on to say that triple talaq ”is a cruel and most demeaning form of divorce.” India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi also spoke out against the practice saying India cannot allow the lives of Muslim women to be ruined by three words said on the phone.  Now, the BMMA is awaiting the decision of India’s Supreme Court on its petition. The group’s   Zakia Soman and Noorjehan, who uses only one name, are hopeful of a ban against the practice which they call ” .”  According to the Quran, a man must consider the decision for a period of four months after he initially declares talaq, Soman explains. It is only at the end of this period can the divorce be finalized. Islamic law also provides for the presence of an arbitrator if there are problems during the process.  But Soman herself knows that reality often is quite different from theory. Her husband left her immediately after saying the words one day almost 15 years ago. Pushback, Not everyone, however, is in favor of banning triple talaq.  India’s diverse communities of multiple faiths each have their own laws for marriage, divorce and inheritance  —   matters deemed ”personal law.” Various politicians have proposed an overarching secular law called the Uniform Civil Code which would replace religious laws.  For some Muslim religious leaders, the fact that India’s current government  —   led by a Hindu nationalist party  —   is in favor of a Uniform Civil Code is a source of concern. ”It is our fundamental given in the constitution, right to abide by our personal laws, you cannot snatch our right from us,” said Mohammad Jafar, a life member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, the legal organization opposing BMMA’s petition filed in the Supreme Court. Jafar recognizes that it is a problem when some men give divorce instantaneously. The solution, he says, is education for these men, as they have done something not permissible in Islam. ”As a Muslim, one has to follow the rules of marriage and separation according to the Quran and Sunnah, the teachings of Mohammad, so we have to abide by it, and this right has been given in the Constitution, so why do they want to change it?” he said. Still fighting, Soman and the BMMA, however, see the fight at hand as one for gender equality.  Farha, the single mother of three from Jaipur, now relies on the help of her parents to feed and support her children.  She stays in the upper floor of the same house that she lived in when she was married. Her husband lives below. A housewife for years, Farha, does not have a job. All she wants, she says, is for her children to be provided for. For women like Farha, there are few legal resources that she can rely on after a man abandons her. ”The problem here is not religion, it’s patriarchy masquerading as religion,” Soman said.": "51874",
    "“He’s trying to be like he’s Robin Hood and the banks, he’s gonna get the banks. But in the meantime he’s borrowed from the banks, he’s personally guaranteed, and he didn’t put them on his personal financial disclosure form, which is a tremendous sin,” Trump said, inaccurately describing the forms the loans were omitted from. “I mean, that’s a horrible thing he did. And he didn’t disclose all of this information. ” According to the The New York Times, which first reported the omission of the loans last week, Cruz did report the loans in personal financial disclosures filed with the Senate, but did not report them as a source of income for his Senate campaign. Cruz has called the failure to disclose the loans a “technical and inadvertent filing error. ” In the interview on The Howie Carr Show, Trump reiterated his case that Cruz, who was born in Canada, should seek to clarify that he is eligible for the presidency, saying “He’s got to go to court to take out the doubt, Howie. ” And at various points in the conversation the real estate magnate set his sights on Jeb Bush, panning him for his campaign expenditures, calling him a “child,” and saying “he’s ashamed to use the last name Bush. ” “He should give it to the Wounded Warriors and stop wasting his money,” Trump said. “And much of it was spent on negative ads on me and then he wonders why I treat him badly. But he’s a child. He’s a child. And this is the problem. We can’t have people like this running our country. China would walk all over Jeb Bush. ISIS would walk all over Jeb Bush. ” Trump added later, “He’s like a child, he’s like a child. And he ought to try using his last name. He’s not even proud of his last name. He says Jeb. And he oughta use his last name. ” Trump also appeared to defend South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, who criticized the former reality TV star in her rebuttal to President Obama’s State of the Union address, calling on Americans to “resist the siren call of the angriest voices,” a comment that led Trump supporters and Trump himself to hit back at her, saying she is “weak” on immigration. But on Wednesday, Trump, who called himself an “angry person” who is “very happy in my life, but I’m very angry about the way our country is being run,” said Haley said she understood his anger. “She understood it and she actually, you know, came out and said, I fully understand it,” Trump said. “I’ve been a supporter of hers and she understood that I’m angry, but it’s not just me. I just filled up an arena in Oklahoma. ”": "104038",
    "Police in Malaysia announced this week the arrest of fifteen people suspected of fundraising, recruiting, and attempting to purchase and amass   materials for the Islamic State (  ) terrorist group. One of those arrested is a police officer. [Reuters reports that some of the fifteen suspects are believed to have been operating together under the orders of Muhammad Wanndy Mohamed Jedi, an Islamic State operative with Malaysian roots, located in Syria. Some were plotting an attack within Malaysia’s borders, while others were working to recruit more jihadis for the cause or fundraise to help bring plots to fruition.  They were involved in collecting funds to be channeled to an Islamic   group in the southern Philippines and arranging the movement of “two foreign terror suspects” from Malaysia to a Southeast Asian country, [Malaysian Inspector General] Khalid Abu Bakar said. Other activities included attempting to acquire chemicals to make bombs, recruiting Malaysians to join Islamic State in Syria, collecting funds from Islamic State sympathizers in Malaysia and setting up working arrangements with militant groups around Southeast Asia, he said. Malaysian officials have grown increasingly tense regarding the potential threat of an Islamic State attack in the Southeast Asian country, which boasts a majority Muslim population. On Friday, a shopping mall in Peringgit shut down after a written note surfaced claiming terrorists had planted four bombs around the mall. While the threat proved to be a false alarm, the swiftness with which Malaysian authorities reacted highlights the fears of a potential successful terror attack unfolding in the near future. Malaysian police announced this week an initiative not just to capture and contain Islamic State jihadists, but to counter their propaganda online. “We cannot afford to wait,” Inspector General Khalid said on Friday. “That’s why every single piece of information, no matter how small that links a person with Daesh members, we will take action against them. ” The initiative will launch April 1 and will boast an online   recruitment team in every state of Malaysia. Police did not provide details on what the   messaging centers will post online specifically. Earlier this month, Malaysian authorities announced they had thwarted an Islamic State plan to abduct Prime Minister Najib Razak, as well as several of his ministers. “On January 30, 2015, there were plans by 13 people linked to Daesh [Islamic State] to kidnap the country’s leaders including the Prime Minister, the Home Minister and the Defence Minister,” Home Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi told reporters. “Although there is no proper Daesh establishment in the country, those here [in Malaysia] were being influenced and have been receiving orders from the IS network in Syria,” he explained. The arrests this week prove the ties between ISIS jihadists in Syria and supporters in Malaysia. The Islamic State is far from the only jihadist group operating in Malaysia, however. Malaysia’s The Star reported in January that there are four major Syrian rebel   jihadi groups recruiting in Malaysia: “the IS, Ajnad   the   Front (also known as   in Syria) and the Free Syrian Army. ” The Malaysian government and native Islamist groups also work to impose Islam as a state religion, though they denounce the Islamic State. The government admitted this week that it has made lists of “liberal Muslim” citizens to be targeted. The “deviants”  —   labeled such for believing in   ideals such as “pluralism,” will be the target of “efforts to sway them back to traditional religious beliefs. ” Among deviant activities, according to Sharia, as practiced in Malaysia are public interactions between men and women, including hugs and kisses on the cheek and any interaction with dogs, which are considered haram [forbidden].": "46833",

    "Clinton Cash author and Breitbart News Senior Editor Peter Schweizer talked about Donald Trump’s   to his book, and Hillary Clinton’s response with SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon on Thursday’s Breitbart News Daily.  “We’ve all seen the stories, and know the stories, about Wall Street firms or Big Oil companies trying to influence our politicians, but there’s always been this consensus that politics is a dirty game, but it’s played by Americans,” Schweizer noted. “That has changed now with the Clintons. That consensus is gone. ”  “You cannot, according to U. S. federal law, as a foreign government or a foreign corporation, write a check to a political candidate. You can’t set up a Super PAC and try to influence an election,” he explained.  But when the Clintons established the Clinton Foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, when Bill Clinton hit the lecture circuit while his wife was Secretary of State, you now had an avenue where oligarchs in Russia, in Nigeria, in Latin America  —   if they wanted something from the Secretary of State, they now had an avenue to try to influence them. I think the evidence is pretty clear they gave a lot of money. There’s pretty clear evidence that favorable actions were taken on Hillary Clinton’s behalf  —   by her, for their benefit. “This is totally new in America, and the question is, this goes beyond the Clintons ultimately, because if this is allowed to continue, this will become the wave of the future,” he warned. “One thing we know about Washington, D. C.: if you give a politician a way to   it’s going to be imitated by everybody, in both political parties. ”  When Bannon asked where the mainstream media has been on the Clinton Cash story, which he described as “one of the biggest scandals in the history of the country,” Schweizer replied, “It’s not only ‘where have they been?’ They have a complete lack of curiosity about it. ” “Think about this for a second,” he urged.  Set the book aside, and look at the fact that the New York Times ran a     piece on how the Clintons got $145 million from the shareholders in this small Canadian company that was being sold to the Russian government, and the State Department approved. That’s a heck of a story right there. When the New York Times runs a front page piece, 4, 000 words, on a subject like that, it generally gets attention. Here’s the challenge: CNN, MSNBC, no one has asked Hillary Clinton a single question about this story. This is a story that ran a year ago. Not a single question. Bannon suggested the media is keeping away from the Clinton Cash story because they know it’s a “time bomb” that could devastate her campaign, as Trump demonstrated by bringing it up Wednesday. “They’re afraid of the answers if they do pursue this,” he said. “It’s got to be something,” Schweizer agreed. “It’s as if something like Watergate was broken, you have the early murmurings of Watergate, reporting by Woodward and Bernstein, and other reporters said, ‘Yeah, that’s interesting, but we’re really just not even going to ask a question about it.’ It is absolutely bizarre. ”  “It’s interesting to watch this unfold. You’ve got some good reporters at some of these outlets that we work with, that have done great reporting on this sort of subject, but you’ve got a lot of frankly lazy reporters  —   or you’ve got management at those news agencies, as you said, that are just not interested in having these stories surface, because of where they’re heading” he charged. For that reason, Schweizer said this has become “a story about the media, and how the media does its job, or doesn’t do its job,” as much as it’s about the Clintons. It also ties into the story about Hillary Clinton’s illicit email server, since as Bannon observed, it’s becoming increasingly clear that server was designed to shield Clinton’s activities and financial dealings from Congress and the Freedom of Information Act. Schweizer said he was convinced Clinton deleted the 30, 000 emails supposedly concerned with yoga routines and party planning because “it’s about these commercial relationships, it’s about follow the money. ” “They needed a way to communicate,” he said. “Bill Clinton is off flying on a plane, doing whatever, wherever he is. Hillary Clinton is Secretary of State, she’s flying the world, doing whatever she’s doing. You’ve got the Clinton Foundation, you’ve got this money apparatus. You have to have a way to communicate. The way you communicate is via email. And, in order to communicate that way, it has to be secret, because the mingling of official State Dept. business with the personal profiteering of the Clintons is not something that can see the light of day. ”  “So the apparatus becomes setting up this email server, and the notion that nobody’s going to find it. Well, you have this Romanian hacker that uncovered this, and I think it’s another example of how elites globally try to operate  —   pull the wool over the eyes of people, but somehow, some way, innovative people around the world uncover this stuff. That’s something that gives me hope for the future,” said Schweizer. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. LISTEN:": "37987",

    "REYNOSA, Tamaulipas  —   More than 20 people have been killed in the raging violence in this city as two rival cartel factions continue to fight for control of lucrative drug and human trafficking routes. [As Breitbart Texas has been reporting, since last week, rival factions of the Gulf Cartel went to war in an effort to seize control of Reynosa. The fighting has led to convoys of gunmen riding in marked SUVs roaming the streets searching for their rivals. The border city of Reynosa is immediately south of McAllen, Texas.   As a response to the cartel violence, the Tamaulipas government has deployed police tactical teams and has called on the Mexican Army and the Mexican Navy to help suppress cartel activity. Military helicopters with snipers on board have been used contain cartel convoys. According to the Tamaulipas government, since the violence started there have been 20 individuals killed and six injured, however, local residents claim the death toll is higher. Mexican authorities have seized armored SUV’s, grenades, various automatic weapons and other weapons.  The fighting comes days after as Breitbart Texas reported, the Mexican government killed Juan Manuel “Comandante Toro” Loiza Salinas, the regional leader of the Gulf Cartel in Reynosa. The man known as El Toro had been linked not only to drug trafficking but also to human smuggling, kidnapping, extortion and other violent crimes that have terrorized this border city.  After El Toro’s death, various of his commanders have been fighting to keep control of Reynosa while rival commanders linked to the faction that controls the border city of Matamoros have been making a push for control. The border city of Matamoros is immediately south of Brownsville, Texas.

    "New Delhi (CNN) U. S. President Barack Obama and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are pals, if you haven’t heard. The pair have ”chemistry,” according to the White House and Indian officials. They’ve shared impromptu strolls on the National Mall and, on Sunday, a long meander through a New Delhi rose garden. Indian weavers are hurriedly piecing together saris as gifts for the first lady. The normally congested Indian capital has been rid of its stray monkeys    at least in the places Obama might visit. And local television networks are running entire pieces speculating the two leaders might take a selfie. Here’s a highlight reel of social media’s favorite Obama and Modi broments so far: The hug, In case anyone doubted the deep bond between Obama and Modi (and how could they?) Air Force One’s arrival on Sunday put any questions to rest. Breaking with established protocol    and surprising television commentators on the dozen or so local news broadcasters    Modi showed up on the tarmac to be the first to greet Obama in India. And it wasn’t just with a handshake. Modi pulled the   commander in chief for the ”bear hug” seen around the world    though like most unplanned hugs in front of a   television audience, it was a little awkward. The two leaders later followed it up with another warm embrace after a joint press conference, stoking rumors of a ”bromance.” The stroll, When Modi visited Obama at the White House in September, the visit ended with Obama blowing up his    schedule and taking the visiting Prime Minister for a stroll at the Martin Luther King memorial on the National Mall. The strolling continued in New Delhi. Obama and Modi, punctuating their bilateral talks, sauntered side by side through the formal gardens at Hyderabad House, a stately 1920s home that now acts as a ceremonial venue. Cameras caught them murmuring away to each other, but reporters could not hear what they said. After the stroll they sat down for a cup of tea. Modi’s camp wasted no time posting a Facebook album of highlights. The toast, When Obama and Modi last sat down for dinner, at the White House in September, only one of them actually ate. Modi was midway through a religious fast that allowed only warm water. This time around, solid foods were consumed by all. A readout of lunch showed vegetarian and nonvegetarian menus, each with more than a dozen dishes.  (Even so, Indian celebrity chef Saransh Goila criticized its lack of variety.) Dinner was an even bigger affair: Held at the presidential palace, the event featured Indian dancers, a receiving line and, of course, a pair of heartfelt toasts. India and the U. S. share the ”natural sense of kinship” their leaders enjoy, Modi said. Obama went with a passage from Walt Whitman’s ”Passage to India”: ”The earth to be spann’d, connected by network,   The people to become brothers and sisters.”   ”Here, in our time, these words have come to pass,” Obama said. The jokes, The leaders poked fun at each other throughout the day. During a press conference, Obama remarked that Modi was greeted like a ”Bollywood star” when he visited New York’s Madison Square Garden last year. Obama also said they compared how much sleep they’re getting, prompting polite laughter from the press corps. ”And it turns out that Modi is getting even less sleep than me. But of course that’s because he’s still new. After you’ve been doing this for about six years, maybe he’ll be able to get an extra hour.” Not everyone was impressed with his answer, however. And this is just the first day of Obama’s historic visit. Stay tuned for highlights from Day Two, which has a parade on the itinerary.

    "A new service award recently created by U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for Border Patrol agents could actually put their lives at risk. The award recognizes an agent who does not use deadly force in a situation where they are confronted by an armed assailant. [“They want us to put ourselves in a bad tactical situation,” National Border Patrol Council Vice President Shawn Moran told Breitbart Texas in an interview Friday evening. “This could lead to one of our agents getting killed. ”  The award is defined by the CBP as: The Use of Deadly Force Encounter Averted award is to recognize and employee who demonstrated clear situational awareness and courage while disarming a suspect using contact controls and verbal commands before the situation escalated to the use of deadly force. The act must demonstrate courage in the face of an armed suspect and result in no injury in accordance with agencies use of force policy. “At first, I thought this was a joke,” Moran told Breitbart Texas. But Border Patrol Agent Chris Cabrera contacted officials in the awards section of CBP and they confirmed it is true, he said. In addition to his Border Patrol duties Cabrera also serves as vice president of NBPC Local 3307 and as NBPC deputy spokesperson. “This is a true indication about how the politically appointed leaders of the CBP truly feel about our agents,” he said. Moran said he had not heard about the award before Cabrera brought it to his attention. “I can’t recall any official discussions between the union and the department over this,” he explained. “This is typical pandering by our executives to organizations like the ACLU and illegal alien advocates. ” The exacerbated leader of the NBPC which represents more than 18, 000 men and women who protect our nation’s borders said, “They are more concerned about placating these groups than protecting Border Patrol agents. ” He said this is also typical for them to roll something like this out on the day before a big holiday weekend hoping no one will notice. The policy appears to put just one more thing an agent must think about when faced with a life threatening situation. The NBPC posted a copy of the award definition on its Facebook page earlier on Friday evening. Commenting on the award, the organization posted, “This type of thinking will get Border Patrol agents killed. If that happens we will hold the creators of this award accountable. This is despicable. ” The CBP seems to be following the lead of the Los Angeles Police Department who rolled out a “Preservation of Life Award. ” The policy was designed to recognize officers who hold their fire to avoid using deadly force, Breitbart News’ William Bigelow reported in November 2015. The Los Angeles Police Protective League had a similar reaction to that of the NBPC. The local police union responded that the award prioritizes the lives of suspected criminals over the lives of officers. NATO forces in Europe considered a similar idea but never implemented it, Bigelow reported. Moran told Breitbart Texas his organization plans on contacting CBP officials after the Memorial Day weekend.

    "Cauliflower had become Lauren Hetrick’s   vegetable. “We have it as often as possible,” says the Rockville mother of three. “Once we roasted it, my kids really liked it  —   and they’ll eat anything if you put cheese on it. ”  But for weeks, Hetrick was unable to find any cauliflower, anywhere. Her quest for it “became a joke,” she says. “I went from grocery to grocery,” futilely stalking the elusive object of her family’s desire. “If I found cauliflower, it was $6 and a really little head, like the size of your hand. That’s not going to feed anyone. Well, maybe the guinea pig. ” These are heady times for cauliflower. High demand, unseasonably cool temperatures in farming regions and limited supply are resulting in scarcity or absurd prices for the latest “it” food. How absurd? You may want to sit down for this: $7. 99 for an organic head at the Takoma Park Silver Spring  . In Philadelphia, Weavers Way Food   suspended stocking the vegetable for three weeks out of concern that the lofty price tag would discourage buyers. But demand persisted. Produce Alliance, a consultant to produce distributors, reported in the Christmas week edition of its market review that cauliflower, the veggie that uprooted king kale, was  —   not to get too technical  —   in “ACT OF GOD” status.   Chefs are using cauliflower in various ways, including on pizza. (Stacy Zarin   The Washington Post)  In layman’s terms, this means “high prices and NONEXISTENT supply. ” (The   alarm is the Alliance’s doing. Vegetable shortages apparently make some people extremely anxious.) Long the bland steamed side dish routinely raked around the dinner plate, surreptitiously fed to pets and plants (not that we speak from experience) or cloaked in   cheese sauce in a (mostly failed) effort to fool the family, cauliflower has become beyond cool. It’s as though the kid you ignored through elementary and middle school, to say nothing of excluding from basement   parties, grew up to become the Jennifer Lawrence of cruciferous vegetables. “Cauliflower is getting its time in the limelight and finally getting some love,” confirms Lorri Koster, a   vegetable supplier in California’s Salinas Valley. It’s certainly a favorite of chefs, who are serving   pizza, cauliflower rice, cauliflower cupcakes, General Tso’s cauliflower,   cauliflower, cauliflower patties and cauliflower mash. Chef Dan Barber of New York’s Blue Hill has a celebrated cauliflower steak with cauliflower puree, a timely dish now that cauliflower costs almost as much as steak. And, yes, cauliflower ice cream is a thing.  [D. C. chefs are making cauliflower a star]  A     veggie that can behave like a carb, cauliflower is a monster in the popular Paleo diet, because “it substitutes for rice,” says Paleo blogger Russ Crandall, who runs the Domestic Man website. His readers frequently request cauliflower recipes. CrossFit fanatics, too, are deeply enamored of the   member of the Brassica family. “I’ve been eating more of it than I have in my entire life,” says Bryant Boucher, a CrossFit instructor in Frisco, Colo. who follows recipes on Paleoplan. com. “I fool myself that it’s rice or mashed potatoes. ” Add to these cravings unseasonably cool weather at California and Arizona farms, and you have the makings of a major shortage. Koster says that her firm normally ships 60, 000 cartons a week, each box containing a dozen to 15 heads, but the frost has zapped shipments to 5, 000. “The way demand escalated really caught us off guard,” she says. Which makes for some desperate shoppers, who’ll pay any price to get their hands on the coveted crucifer. “People get crazy about it,” said Robert Cahill, filling orders earlier this week at the Whole Foods in Plymouth Meeting, Pa. for Instacart, an online grocery shopping service. “They’re not happy about the prices, but they’re buying. ” For some, half a head is better than none. When the price spiked to $7, “I split the cost with a friend,” said resourceful shopper MirnaWay of Philadelphia. “We cut the cauliflower right in half. ” Chefs are feeling the pinch, too. Cauliflower is a “huge staple” in Mike Isabella’s collection of Washington restaurants. The   item at his G on 14th Street and at Nationals Park  —   bigger than chicken parm! bigger than the Italian sub!  —   is the $9 roasted cauliflower hero with pickled vegetables, paprika and romesco sauce. Washington has gone from a    town to a     town. “It probably costs me $8 to make it right now,” says Isabella of the sandwich, as the price of cauliflower “has doubled over the past few weeks. ” “It’s kind of scary,” he says, again demonstrating that produce can produce fear, “but we’re not going to change the prices. ” Whew!  [Mike Isabella is a (grand) mama’s boy]  Cauliflower’s time was long in coming. For decades, it was “in broccoli’s shadow. Now it’s the star of the show,” says Christine Keller of CCD Innovation, a food industry trend analyst that pronounced cauliflower the kale of 2015. This year, the firm is crushing on kelp, the vegetable formerly known as seaweed. But Keller says there’s also another    a vegetable so cool it has yet to make the trend report: kohlrabi. “Have you tried it?” she swoons about the turnip cabbage. “Delicious. ” Meanwhile, cauliflower relief may be in sight. Hetrick finally found   heads at the Safeway last weekend for $6, a relative bargain. Another cold snap, though, and those dollar signs could multiply again. In which case, you may have to help yourself to a dollop of kelp.": "209232",

    "(CNN) Nico Rosberg will start on pole in the Singapore Grand Prix after an imperious performance in qualifying. Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton, who leads Rosberg by two points in the driver standings, only just managed to hold off Red Bull’s Max Verstappen to secure third. Verstappen’s teammate, Daniel Ricciardo, put on an impressive drive and will start second    but still finished 0. 531s behind Rosberg. ”Definitely happy with that one,” Rosberg told reporters after qualifying. ”For sure one of my top three laps ever and I’m so happy that it came on my 200th GP weekend. ”At times it wasn’t clear where we would stack up against Red Bull so I knew I had to pull one out of the bag. ”I’m not worried [about Ricciardo starting from P2] but I’ll certainly be keeping my eye on him!” Hamilton, who struggled throughout practice, was understandably despondent but can take heart from earlier performances this season when starting further back on the grid. ”It has not been my weekend so far,” said the reigning world champion. ”Not many good laps.

    "RIO DE JANEIRO  ” As he struggles to build support for his presidency, Brazil s new leader, Michel Temer, has been dogged by the kind of character issue that pollsters refer to as  a strong negative. ? Temer, rumor has it, is a devil worshiper. The origins of this falsehood are unclear. Temer, 75, a longtime politician, is a Christian of Maronite Lebanese descent. But the rumors have inflicted enough damage that Temer turned to prominent evangelical pastors for help. They encouraged him to make a video appealing for evangelicals  support.  He did a beautiful video, ? said the Rev. Marco Feliciano, a congressman and Pentecostal leader, who appeared at his side in the recording.  He asked the church to pray for him. ? The prayers, and pacts with pastors such as Feliciano, have provided badly needed support to Temer and have given the country s growing evangelical movement unprecedented influence as Brazil goes through its biggest political upheaval in decades. Temer chose an evangelical bishop who believes in creationism to be his top science official and then made him trade minister. The new labor minister also is an evangelical pastor. Just as the Rev. Jerry Falwell s Moral Majority emerged as a force in the United States in the 1980s, Brazilian evangelical leaders have gone from the political sidelines to the center. Their movement is not a coordinated effort to take power, they insist, but a   backlash against secularism, homosexuality and changesÂ  introduced during 13 years of   Workers  Party rule. That era appeared to end this month when lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to suspend President Dilma Rousseff and put her on trial for allegedly breaking budget laws. Temer, Rousseff s former coalition partner turned political rival, became interim president and will serve out the rest of Rousseff s term through 2018 if she is found guilty. Temer enters office with a wobbly mandate. Even if most Brazilians don t think that he is a satanic figure, polls show that he is widely distrusted, with fewer than 10 ‰percent of citizens wanting him to be president, according to surveys.    Just as the late Rev. Jerry Falwell s Moral Majority emerged as a force in the United States in the 1980s, Brazilian evangelical leaders have gone from the political sidelines to the center, wielding more clout than ever before. (Dom Phillips, Jason  )   Temer has sought help from Christian evangelicals, who were some of the strongest backers of Rousseff s suspension. Of the 94 lawmakers from different parties who, according to Feliciano, form part of the  Evangelical Bloc ? in Brazil s lower chamber of Congress, 89 voted to put her on trial. Dozens dedicated their votes  to God ? in the nationally televised proceedings.  [Brazil s new leader is a poet and charmer  ” not a stodgy bureaucrat]  Brazilian evangelicals are not monolithic. They have no single leader. But in a country with more than 30 parties, the movement has benefited from a discipline otherwise lacking in Brazil s political culture of dealmaking and fleeting alliances of convenience, said Paulo BaÃ a, a political scientist and sociologist at Rio de Janeiro s Federal University.  They have more political influence than ever, and they are going through a moment in which they re asserting their power, ? BaÃ a said. The Evangelical Bloc has grown significantly since 2010, when it had an estimated 73 seats in Brazil s   lower house. Although divergent on economic issues, lawmakers in the bloc are overwhelmingly opposed to a 2013 decision, now under appeal to Brazil s Supreme Court, that recognized   marriage. They are also against the legalization of abortion. With a population of 205 ‰million, Brazil remains the world s largest Catholic nation. But 22 ‰percent of Brazilians identify as evangelical Christians, up from 5Â percent in 1970. Many evangelical pastors work in remote rural areas and in Brazil s violent slums, where the government is often absent. That gives pastors an unrivaled ability to mobilize voters at election time. And compared with Brazil s Catholic leaders, the evangelical pastors are more explicit about their political endorsements, BaÃ a said.  They speak clearly in favor of their candidates and even campaign for them, ? he said. A few have also studied on Christian campuses in the United States, including Liberty University, founded by Falwell, which encourages students to promote religious values through civic engagement, said Falwell s son Jerry, the university president.  Brazilian students are compatible with our students and with life in America, ? he said, speaking by phone from Lynchburg, Va. where the campus is located.  They find America similar to what they experience at home. ?     Members of the congregation sing during a service at televangelist Silas Malafaia s Victory in Christ temple. (Lianne   The Washington Post)  Many Brazilian evangelical leaders had initially supported the Workers  Party because of its focus on helping the poor; their votes helped its founder, Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, win the presidency in 2006 and 2010. But that pact fell apart during Rousseff s tenure because of the party s backing of a bill to prohibit homophobia and a law to allow the  morning after ? pill for rape victims, which evangelical leaders felt opened the door for abortion. Leading televangelist Silas Malafaia, one of Rousseff s harshest critics, said the source of the break was a disagreement about the role of the government in shaping Brazilian values.  What is their game? ? Malafaia asked in an interview.  To control the state. ?  We saw that communism was in their DNA, ? Malafaia said, speaking at his spacious home in a gated community on Rio s outskirts.  [With new Brazilian government, conservationists fear for the Amazon]  Malafaia, who was one of Brazil s pioneering televangelists in the 1980s, has more than 3 ‰million followers on his Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts, where he routinely skewers Rousseff and criticizes gay rights and feminism. He has been outspoken in his support of Temer as the leader of a government of  national salvation, ? and he recorded a video attempting to squelch the rumor that Temer is a closeted Satan lover. Malafaia s Victory in Christ temple in a rough section of Rio was packed with television cameras and thousands of worshipers on a recent night. Homosexuality is  prostitution ? and abortion is a sin, Malafaia told the congregation, which erupted in shouts of  amen ? and  hallelujah. ? Marcos Melo, 35, a member of Malafaia s church, said  spiritual problems ? were at the core of Brazil s many ills, from crime and political corruption to the worst economic downturn since the 1930s.  I believe that God is stepping in and lifting this immorality from the people, ? said Melo. Rousseff s suspension, he said,  was necessary for Brazil to heal. ?    Members of congregation worship through song at the Victory in Christ temple in Rio de Janeiro. (Lianne   The Washington Post)  Some of the evangelical figures who threw stones at Rousseff are facing legal troubles, including Eduardo Cunha, the former speaker of the lower house. Within weeks of presiding over a suspension vote against the president in April, Cunha was ordered to step down because he is under investigation for corruption and obstruction of justice. Temer has appointed AndrÃ© Moura, a congressman and a member of the Social Christian Party  ” an evangelical party  ” as his government s leader in the lower house. Moura is among those under investigation in a Supreme Court probe into corruption at   oil company Petrobras and also faces allegations that he was involved in crimes including conspiracy and attempted homicide in past years. He and Cunha have denied the allegations. Despite Brazil s image as a land of   bikinis and Carnival debauchery, evangelical leaders insist that it is a morally conservative country and say that Brazilian politics are beginning to reflect that.  Many evangelicals in Brazil see their country in much of the same way the evangelical right views the United States, ? said Andrew Chesnut, a Latin America expert and professor of religious studies at Virginia Commonwealth University.  They think the Workers  Party put Brazil on a path to moral ruin. It legalized gay marriage. It has given Brazil one of Latin America s highest   abortion rates, even though the procedure remains illegal. There s pornography all over the place. ?  A lot of Brazilians outside of major cities are fairly conservative morally, and the evangelical agenda resonates with them, ? Chesnut said.

    "PIGEON FORGE, Tenn.  —   Deadly wildfires ripped through the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains in Tennessee on Monday night and Tuesday, forcing thousands to flee as emergency responders sought to contain a blaze that conjured biblical comparison. “Everywhere you looked, there were fires everywhere. It was like driving into hell,” said Rain Moore, 32, a lieutenant with the Sneedville Fire Department, about an hour and a half away. Mr. Moore said he arrived early Tuesday and, while fighting the fire in the darkness, saw orange flames burning from the center of trees, indicating a strong intensity. Fueled by high winds and a drought in Tennessee, the fires damaged about 150 buildings and forced thousands to evacuate. Three people died and 14 others were injured, officials said Tuesday afternoon. More than 14, 000 people left Gatlinburg, and others were evacuated from nearby Pigeon Forge as well as other parts of Sevier County, in the eastern part of the state, according to the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency. More than 10, 000 people had been left without power in Sevier County. “This is the largest fire in the last hundred years of the state of Tennessee,” Gov. Bill Haslam said on Tuesday afternoon. Dramatic videos shot by residents and shared online showed flames lining the edge of the highways used for evacuations. The fires, the result of human error, started in Great Smoky Mountains National Park and were spread by winds that reached 87 miles per hour on Monday night. Greg Miller, the chief of the Gatlinburg Fire Department, said the authorities expected winds of about 60 m. p. h. overnight Tuesday, but were hopeful that rain would come first. Officials did not say how the three who died were killed. Gatlinburg’s mayor, Mike Werner, was among those who lost his home, he said on Tuesday. He also lost his business of more than three decades. “It’s a devastating time for us and for Gatlinburg,” he said. “But, as I said earlier this morning, we’re strong, we’re resilient and we’re going to make it. ” By early Tuesday evening, a thick,   haze cut visibility in Gatlinburg to only a few city blocks. The fire had hopscotched around the resort town of 3, 900 people and 60, 000 hotel beds, flattening some buildings while leaving others next door or around the block untouched. Emergency vehicles, lights flashing, cruised past   cars and gutted businesses as a city spokeswoman took reporters on a tour of the destruction. The town, located at the base of Great Smoky Mountains National Park about 50 miles from Knoxville, relies heavily on tourism. Pigeon Forge, home to Dolly Parton’s Dollywood theme park, is among the premier tourist destinations in the region. On Twitter, the National Park Service announced that officials had “closed all facilities in the park due to the extensive fire activity, and downed trees. ” Pete Owens, a spokesman for Dollywood, said in a statement that the park had not been damaged but that more than a dozen cabins managed by the company had been damaged or destroyed. Ms. Parton said she was “heartbroken” by the destruction: “I am praying for all the families affected by the fire and the firefighters who are working so hard to keep everyone safe. ” The fires spread through Tennessee as much of the South has been enduring a crippling drought, even though rainfall this week offered some relief. The United States Drought Monitor reported last week that 60 percent of Tennessee was in “exceptional” or “extreme” drought, the two most severe ratings. Wildfires, once a seasonal phenomenon, have become a consistent threat, partly because climate change has resulted in drier winters and warmer springs, which combine to pull moisture off the ground and into the air. The authorities closed Route 321 at the Rocky Top Sports World, barring access into downtown Gatlinburg. About 700 people gathered on Tuesday morning inside the complex’s main building, a   center on the   campus: mountain men with gray beards and canes alongside several people in blue surgical masks. One man was too choked up to talk, his tiny   bull mix shaking inside his battered camouflage jacket. Dozens of Red Cross volunteers and firefighters tended to people who seemed shellshocked. “I got my family, man,” said Greg Lanham, 36, who fled the flames around 8 p. m.

Mr. Lanham, a maintenance worker, and Ms. Lanham, a maid, both worked at Sidney James Mountain Lodge, which survived the fire but remains closed. “We didn’t know what to do,” Mr. Lanham said. “We took what little money we had in our pockets and found a place to stay. ” The family did manage to save their dogs, Gizmo, a Pekingese, and Scruffy, a   Russell mix, along with their kitten, Snowball. Standing at the sports complex’s food counter, where Red Cross volunteers served free coffee, hot dogs, burgers and fries, and boxes of fried chicken, Ms. Lanham joined her family and, crying, told her husband: “It’s gone. It’s all gone. ” “We did lose everything,” Mr. Lanham said. “We got the clothes on our back. ”": "22572",
    "“It’s about time we started to take photography seriously and treat it as a hobby,” says Elliott Erwitt, the acclaimed eternal amateur and member of Magnum Photos since 1953. Erwitt is known for his ability to capture moments of humor and irony in everyday life. His work ranges from portraits of cultural figures to witty photographs of dogs. An exhibition that examines that span will be on display at The Harry Ransom Center at The University of Texas Austin. “Elliott Erwitt: Home Around the World” will feature more than 200 photographs, including classic Erwitt images and lesser known surprises. Erwitt commented to The Harry Randsom Center about the exhibition: “I hope that my checkered career will encourage some photographers to work in the same spirit that deals with the human condition —  while not taking themselves too seriously. ” “It’s been a long journey but worth all the laughs and tears.

    "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump responded to President Barack Obama’s assertion that he was “unfit” to hold the office of the presidency, pointing out Hillary Clinton’s failures. [“They have betrayed our security and our workers, and Hillary Clinton has proven herself unfit to serve in any government office,” Trump said referring to the Obama presidency.

    "Every once in a while, people find strange contraptions that can be used inside the iPhone’s messaging app to crash the recipient’s device. Some of them are serious bugs, while others will only freeze your iPhone for a few minutes. In either case, they’re seriously annoying. And guess what? There’s a new   text message in town that people will keep sending to their   buddies. However, it can all be easily fixed.    and   the bug relies on sending a string of images and characters to a target: a white flag emoji, a zero, and the rainbow emoji. The issue affects any iOS device that’s on iOS 10. x, but if you’re still running earlier iOS versions, you’re safe. However, the actual sending of the message isn’t completely   as the same string can also freeze the sender’s phone. The trick involves either using the Notes app on iCloud. com or iCloud Drive to share the characters. Once the message hits the targeted iPhone, the device stops working for a few minutes regardless of whether the recipient reads it or not. You won’t be able to do anything once the freeze is in effect. The buttons won’t work, and you’ll have to wait for the phone to reboot by itself. “What you see in the text is the waving white flag emoji, a zero, and the rainbow emoji,” a technical explanation on  . “The rainbow flag emoji isn’t an emoji in itself, it’s made of three characters: waving white flag, a character called variation sector 16 (VS16 for short) and the rainbow. What VS16 does in this case essentially is tells the device to combine the two surrounding characters into one emoji, yielding the rainbow flag (this is similar to how skin tone modifiers work, but not exactly the same). “The text you’re copying is actually waving white flag, VS16, zero, rainbow emoji. What I’m assuming is happening is that the phone tries to combine the waving white flag and the zero into an emoji, but this obviously can’t be done. Usually, the phone wouldn’t try to do this, but it notices that the rainbow emoji is also there, and knows that it can combine the white flag and rainbow emoji, so it tries. ” There’s one thing you need to do in case the Messages app keeps crashing. You’ll have to head to   on the phone so that the Messages is restored. To prevent this from happening again until Apple fixes it, you can also consider blocking on the iPhone the persons who’re using it against you and maybe even reassess those friendships. Interestingly, the bug also affects Android handsets, but they’ll be slow down significantly rather than freezing completely. This article   on  .": "123639",
    "People stopped, stared and posed for photos. A colourful mural on the side of Ben’s Chili Bowl restaurant, a lynchpin of African American life in Washington, included Barack and Michelle Obama, Muhammad Ali, Prince and Harriet Tubman. It included actor Taraji P Henson and rapper Wale. But one prominent local figure was missing. “Is this where Bill Cosby used to be?” asked Vivian Staine, 30, a nurse and studio owner, as she beheld the artwork for the first time. “It’s kind of shocking to see Bill Cosby is down after he’s been here so long. ” The entertainer’s fall from grace has posed difficult questions for many in the black community and for Ben’s Chili Bowl in particular. Cosby has been a regular customer since his navy days in the 1950s. He befriended its owners, Ben Ali, an immigrant from Trinidad who died in 2009, and his wife Virginia, who now runs the restaurant with their three sons. A historical information sign outside states: “Thanks in part to the patronage of entertainer Bill Cosby, Ben’s has become a national landmark. ” It was no surprise that when artist Aniekan Udofia painted a mural on the restaurant’s exterior wall in 2012, it featured Cosby along with Obama, local radio DJ Donnie Simpson and godfather of   Chuck Brown. But then came allegations that Cosby sexually assaulted dozens of women and court documents showing that he admitted intending to drug women he wanted to have sex with. Last Saturday, in Pennsylvania, a judge in the sexual assault trial of    Cosby declared a mistrial after jurors reported a hopeless deadlock after six days of deliberation. On Wednesday, in a ceremony featuring comedian Dave Chappelle and others, Udofia unveiled a new mural expanded to 16 luminaries  —   but minus Cosby. Virginia Ali, 83, explains that the restaurant ran an online poll to ask the public who should be included: Barack Obama came first, Michelle Obama was second and Cosby did not place in the top 16.  Referring to the allegations against him, she said: “That’s not the man I knew. It’s one of those ‘he said, she said’ things and there’s no point getting into it because I wasn’t there. I feel badly for everyone involved. ” Cosby’s face is still visible in two photo montages inside the restaurant, which is famous for its signature    —   a sausage with mustard, chopped onions and homemade chili on a hotdog bun. Ali said: “Everybody’s welcome to Ben’s. When you walk in the door, what you’ve done is left outside and we treat you as family, as a guest. We treat everyone with the same dignity and warmth. We don’t judge people here. ” As newlyweds in 1958, Ben and Virginia Ali used their $5, 000 savings to renovate and open the restaurant on U Street in what had been a silent film cinema. They had spotted a gap in the market.  “There were a lot of hamburger places in this town but there were no hot dog and no chili places,” Virginia Ali recalled. “It was a little scary for me: I didn’t know anything about the restaurant business. ” Washington was, she said, still a racially segregated city. U Street, known as Black Broadway, was at the heart of African American life. Subject to Jim Crow laws elsewhere, between 1895 and 1920 the number of   businesses in the area mushroomed from about 15 to more than 300. They included thriving bars, clubs and theatres: Duke Ellington grew up and played his first jazz here.  But after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr in 1968, riots erupted along the U Street corridor. At the request of the civil rights activist Stokely Carmichael, the Alis kept the restaurant open past curfew to serve police officers, firefighters and black activists. Sitting at the original bar as staff feverishly prepared   and burgers, Virginia nodded towards the now bustling street. “There was a lot of tension,” she said. “The national guard were out there with big guns. Young people were walking down the street with Molotov cocktails. I could smell the tear gas. I got a little tear gas in my eye. It was a very frightening time. ” In subsequent years U Street suffered decay and disinvestment as the middle class took flight, drug trafficking took hold and storefronts became shells. But Ben’s Chili Bowl stood firm, even during the construction of an underground railway line. Its roll call of famous customers includes Ellington, King, Harry Belafonte, Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald, Jimmy Fallon, Jesse Jackson, George Lopez, Chris Rock, Usher, Bono, Hillary Clinton and then   Obama. The restaurant also appeared in movies: The Pelican Brief with Denzel Washington and State of Play with Russell Crowe. Today, U Street is gentrifying and diversifying, attracting a new generation of affluent urban dwellers and the usual dilemmas around changing character and spiralling prices. Ben’s Chili Bowl’s neighbours include banks, bars, dry cleaners, an Italian market, a tarot card reader, a barre and cycling studio, a yoga studio, an Ethiopian restaurant and the historic Lincoln Theatre. The African American Civil War Memorial and Museum is a short walk away.  On Thursday, Tanesha Willis, 36, came for her first look at the mural. “I think it’s epic, it’s gorgeous actually,” she said. “It’s got people and colours that embody DC. ” The sight of the Obamas made her wistful in the age of Donald Trump, a president accused of reigniting forces of white nationalism. This week the Congressional Black Caucus declined an invitation to meet him.  “It’s sad that as Americans we’ve come so far yet overnight we’ve gone backwards,” Willis said. “People fought for our freedom and we could lose that. A hundred years later people harbor the same hate because of skin colour. ” Bridget Eguakun, 58, a retired staff assistant at the Internal Revenue Service, took photos of the new mural and cited the Obamas, Prince and Muhammad Ali as her favourites.  “I think it’s awesome,” she said. “It’s an African American restaurant and they’re depicting the parts played by African American people. ” She shared the ambivalence of many regarding the exclusion of Cosby.  “He did some wrong but you can’t take away everything he contributed to African American culture,” she said about Cosby. “He’s still a great guy. The University of Missouri just took away his honorary degree but they didn’t give his money back. ” Several onlookers commented that The Cosby Show gave a positive portrayal of a black middle class family in the 1980s, a time when U Street was in disarray and most media portrayals of African Americans focused on crime, drugs and poverty. But Cosby’s legacy has been tarnished by the recent scandal. Brandi Summers, assistant professor of African American Studies at Virginia Commonwealth University, said: “There’s a lot of tension between people in the black community who think Bill Cosby’s been set up because his wealth and power are threatening to white people and they’re trying to take him down, and others who think the women are telling the truth and he’s a predator. ” She added: “Sometimes the burden of black figures is to represent most or all black people and we forget all individuals have their own stories. We invented Bill Cosby as a figure we don’t know the man. The Cosby Show’s legacy can live on but him as a figure is what’s transformed. ”": "151055",
    "On Saturday night, following the HBO premiere of Beyoncé’s second visual album, Lemonade, the world went to bed not knowing if they would ever learn the true identity of ”Becky with the good hair.”    According to a verse on Lemonade, Becky was the other woman who the love of Beyoncé’s life was cheating with. During both her solo career and her years as a member of Destiny’s Child, Beyoncé’s music has often referenced the trifling, perhaps fictional, humans who have wronged her  —   from the man who would would max out a young Bey’s card, give her bad credit, and buy her gifts with her own ends to the hater who said she couldn’t breathe without him to the man who showed his ass and became the best thing Beyoncé never had. But those songs, like many other pop songs, have always stopped short of identifying the foolish or confirming if those people even existed. Initially, it seemed that Becky and her good hair would be one of those amorphous ghosts  —   a placeholder for the wrath of Beyoncé’s fans’ ire, a cipher whose sole purpose is to be a lightning rod of anger, a universal punching bag.    But, just as Saturday night was starting to bleed into Sunday morning, something funny happened.    Becky might have revealed herself. What did Becky with the good hair do to Beyoncé?                                       Becky and her good hair are integral to Lemonade. The album’s first four songs and videos depict a howling, scalding rage, setting the bones for everything that follows. The narrative is that the love of Bey’s life  —   the implicit message is that it’s Jay Z, but more on this in a bit  —   cheated on her and lied to her, and she found out. ”You remind me of my father, a magician, able to exist in two places at once. In the tradition of men in my blood,” Bey recites during the ”Intuition” video vignette.    At the center of the maelstrom is the other woman, the mistress, the side chick. And that woman is addressed in ”Sorry,” the fourth song on the album, as ”Becky with the good hair.” Bey sings: ”He only want me when I’m not on there. He better call Becky with the good hair.” It’s a throwaway diss, and Beyoncé is actually doing ”Becky” a favor by putting her into a witness protection program of sorts. She’s not dragging Becky through the mud. She’s not making her a target of the Beyhive, Beyoncé’s loyal fanbase. But we know that she’s someone we shouldn’t like because even though she apparently has good hair (which could also be seen as a throwaway diss   a commentary on how smooth, straight hair is considered desirable and attractive) she is a person who didn’t respect Beyoncé’s marriage and caused her pain.    To be clear, Beyoncé is pretty ruthless toward Jay in the song, even if she doesn’t name him directly; she’s much more harsh to him than she is to Becky. Beyoncé isn’t just blaming Becky, but she’s also making it clear that Becky isn’t some innocent bystander. Did ”Becky with the good hair” reveal herself? In the hours following the Lemonade premiere, fashion designer Rachel Roy posted an interesting update to Instagram. Attached to a picture of herself and a friend was the caption, ”Good hair don’t care, but we will take good lighting, for selfies. or self truths, always. live in the light #nodramaqueens”:            The phrase ”Good hair don’t care” might as well have been written in fire. Roy posting that line to the internet and her thousands of followers was like a person jumping into the lion’s den, but only if said person was wearing a vest of ribeye steaks and bacon underwear. To the casual observer, Roy and Bey’s shared usage of ”good hair” might be a coincidence. But there’s much more to it than that. Who is Rachel Roy? And is she Becky? Roy is probably best known for being a fashion designer who’s made multiple appearances on Project Runway and appearances on Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Unless you’re into fashion or reality television, you probably have no idea who she is. But to faithful members of the Beyhive, Roy has been floating around in Beyoncé’s orbit as a   villain for the last couple of years.    Roy’s origin story with music’s most powerful couple begins with her stint as an intern at Jay Z’s clothing line Rocawear after she finished college (around 1996). According to Teen Vogue, she worked in every department, and eventually worked her way up to become a creative director. This plays into Roy’s role in the Great Elevator Fight of 2014, when Beyoncé’s sister Solange infamously attacked Jay Z while the two shared an elevator after the Met Ball. Make no mistake, Roy wasn’t in the elevator when everything went down. But her existence may have spurred Solange’s attack on Jay. Everyone knows what happened in the elevator. Leaked security video of the fight  —   which showed Solange attacking Jay Z  —   went viral online. And Beyoncé later addressed the incident in the remix to her song ”Flawless,” where she talks about shit going down when there’s a ”billion dollars in an elevator.” But there’s a secondary story from that same night that never received as much attention: Solange had a   with Roy before she got into that fateful elevator. At the time, US Weekly reported that Beyoncé got involved, but it wasn’t clear what was said or why the two fought. Later, The Daily News reported that Solange fought with Jay because of Roy and Jay Z’s working relationship possibly becoming more. ”Rachel is a little too close to Jay Z,” the Daily News’s source said. ”Solange doesn’t like it, and Beyoncé doesn’t like it.”    Meanwhile, Wendy Williams connected the dots and alleged that Roy and Jay may have had a sexual relationship when she was an intern at Rocawear, suggesting that something like a flirty look or a greeting that was a little too comfortable set Solange off at the Met Ball party:  Fast forward to 2016 and ”Becky with the good hair,” and this theory that Roy is Becky begins to make sense. She has pretty hair that looks nice, which she touts as her most remarkable feature. She wrote a message about said hair hours after Beyoncé’s Lemonade premiere. She used some of the same phrasing Beyoncé used to describe said hair. She has prior drama with the Knowles family. And if Lemonade is seen as Beyoncé addressing that fight and the rift with her relationship with Jay Z, then everything about Roy being ”Becky” locks into place. What’s more uncertain at this point is why the spirit moved Roy to post that Instagram picture with that caption. Was it a cry for attention? Does she have bad friends who encouraged her to do it? Is she not of sound mind? Rachel Roy feels the sting of the Beyhive Beyoncé’s Beyhive didn’t waste any time in dragging Roy. They began responding to the picture, so much that Roy flipped her Instagram account to private. Her Wikipedia page was also changed, referring to Roy as ”Rachel Roach,” or a ”Dusty Side Hoe that died under a lemonade stand.” There was even some spillover to celebrity chef Rachael Ray’s social media mentions because of their similar names and because people were not too familiar with Roy. Amidst the internet fury, Roy tweeted an odd message that appeared to be about Lemonade, her Becky connection, and her haters. Rather than directly deny having an affair with Jay Z, she instead made a declaration about how despicable bullying is:      I respect love, marriages, families and strength. What shouldn’t be tolerated by anyone, no matter what, is bullying, of any kind.\n  —   Rachel Roy (@Rachel_Roy) April 24, 2016    She’s right. The internet hate was ugly and obscene. The attacks were uncalled for. But still, Roy didn’t explain why she used the phrase ”good hair don’t care” in the first place if she didn’t want the glare of the Beyhive upon her. Before Roy’s Instagram post, no one knew who Becky was nor was anyone really thinking about Roy. And now everyone was. How much of Lemonade is autobiographical? The most shocking thing about Lemonade is how blunt and raw its songs and poetic interludes are. Beyoncé talks about her father. She talks about the love of her life. She talks about how both of those men have hurt her with their dishonesty and infidelity. There are points where the album is so unapologetically uncomfortable that it becomes this sublime piece of art. But the thing about Beyoncé is that she has never been known for being an open person. In fact, in this age of leaks and social media, she’s managed to keep everything a secret. Look at Lemonade  —   no one knew what to expect when it premiered on Saturday night after being announced just a week or so before, just like no one knew she was going to drop her Beyoncé album with no prior marketing or promotion in 2013. When it comes to media access, Bey’s reputation is that she doesn’t give many interviews. In 2015, the New York Times published an analysis of Beyoncé’s media presence (or lack of one) noting that though she was on the cover of the September issue of Vogue  —   the holy grail of magazine covers  —   she didn’t grant the magazine an interview. The New York Times reported:  At some imperceptible point around 2013 to 2014, she appears to have stopped giving    interviews. A member of her team told a reporter in May that despite numerous appearances, Beyoncé had not answered a direct question in more than a year. Her publicist declined to clarify this stance. (When Beyoncé does answer questions, it tends to be in writing or, for TV, taped.)     It’s fascinating that the biggest pop star on the planet is the most private one. It’s also incredible that Beyoncé has such a full handle on her image. Everything is seemingly on her own terms. That’s led to this idea that we never get the ”real” Beyoncé. Vulture’s Nitsuh Abebe examined this criticism in 2013, explaining that people see a machine instead of a human when they look at Beyoncé:  Here, after all, is a criticism one hears of Beyoncé qua pop star: that she is ”flawless” in an empty, dutiful way. That beneath the    performances and public togetherness, there lies a robot. Or, if not a robot, then something like the kid who’s been so pressured and trained to master a skill that he lacks any kind of feeling beyond his perfect technique —  a   imposing blank.  If you expand this theory  —   that everything Beyoncé touches is constructed by Bey and her team  —   it puts a different spin on her personal life. Everything we think we know about her life is something she wants us to know. From the sexual ecstasy  expressed in the songs on Beyoncé to the fight in the elevator to the visceral pain in Lemonade and Becky’s good hair Instagram post  —   it’s all part of her grand design. I’m not quite sure how much of that theory I buy. But if it’s true, then I’ll admire the skill needed to pull that off instead of being miffed that I fell for it. Lemonade is no exception. It’s Beyoncé’s most personal album yet. That’s why everyone was so shocked to hear the words spoken and sung about Jay and her father. But only Beyoncé knows how much of it, if any of it, is authentic.    Her version of the story is the only version of the story. And that she doesn’t owe or give anyone an explanation about which parts are real, that she doesn’t have to make her life and her art more helpful for our understanding, is much more intriguing than any side chick she’s singing about.  11 songs you didn’t know were Prince songs": "200154",
    "Bill Murray’s mood swings were so tempestuous during the making of Ghostbusters that Dan Aykroyd nicknamed him The Murricane. The Groundhog Day actor doesn’t have an agent and instead uses a   number for pitches and offers. On his 20th birthday he was arrested trying to smuggle around 10lb of marijuana through Chicago’s O’Hare airport. He has jammed with Eric Clapton, lived and breathed Hunter S Thompson to play him in Where the Buffalo Roam, sung a duet with Clint Eastwood and tended an Austin bar for the night with members of the   Clan, giving everyone tequila shots no matter what they ordered.  There is already   folklore around the living legend that is Bill Murray, and now we have another one: when Bill Murray does an impression of a crying baby, he looks exactly like Tom Hanks.  In the biggest optical illusion the internet has encountered since The Dress, a photo posted to the Facebook group Reasons My Son Is Crying has triggered a debate just as furious, with many people convinced it’s the Forrest Gump actor, despite the original post stating it was Bill Murray. The picture was posted to the Facebook group in 2013 by Laura   but was taken in October 2012 at St Andrews golf course in Scotland by her husband, Adam Ross. The photo features Laura holding her crying    son, Alexander, in front of Murray, who is mimicking the child’s expression. According to   who lives in Perthshire, the photo “pops up on Facebook every few months”. This week, the photo was widely shared online again and became a trending item across social media and websites including Reddit.  “We are finding this very funny. I personally don’t see the resemblance to Tom Hanks but we’ve noticed that people have been mentioning it for years,” she told the Guardian. She said that Murray was friendly and chatted to everyone at the golf course but that their encounter was brief. “We are big Ghostbusters fans and have grown up with his movies. Although I’m also a huge fan of Tom Hanks, so that would have been awesome as well. ” Two years later,   met Murray again when he was golfing with Huey Lewis, and she got him to sign the photo. “He got a laugh from it,” she said.  Does Alexander, who is now four, know that his photo is causing such a stir? “Nope. No clue. He barely knows that it’s him in the photo and doesn’t know who Bill is. ”": "151607",
    "Barack Obama has ordered US intelligence to review evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election after coming under sustained pressure from congressional Democrats. The review will be one of Obama’s final instructions to the intelligence agencies, which will soon report to Donald Trump, whom congressional Democrats consider the beneficiary of a hack targeting the Democratic National Committee. Lisa Monaco, the White House counterterrorism director, announced what she called a “full review” at a breakfast briefing sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor on Friday. At the White House press briefing later on Friday, Eric Schultz, the deputy White House press secretary, denied the review was “an effort to challenge the outcome of the election”.  “We have acknowledged who won the election,” he said. “It wasn’t the candidate the president campaigned for. He has gone out of his way to ensure a smooth transition of power. ” The review will span the last three presidential election cycles, Schultz told reporters. “These agencies will have to take a look at what we saw in 2008, 2012 and 2016. This is going to be a deep dive. This is a review that will be broad and deep at the same time. They’re going to look at where the activity leads them to look at. ” There were intrusions into both the Obama and John McCain campaigns in 2008, publicly attributed to the Chinese, he continued, and although there were no notable incidents in 2012, “knowing what we know now” that election will also be scrutinised.  In 2016, he said, the government did not detect any increased cyber activity on election day itself but the FBI made public specific acts in the summer and fall, tied to the highest levels of the Russian government. “This is going to put that activity in a greater context . .. dating all the way back to 2008. ” Asked if the review would investigate Russia’s motives, Schultz replied: “Malicious cyber activity, specifically malicious cyber activity tied to our elections, has no place in the international community. Unfortunately this activity is not new to Moscow. We’ve seen them do this for years . .. The president has made it clear to President Putin that this is unacceptable. ” Obama expected the review to be completed before he leaves office, Schultz said. “This is a huge priority . .. I think the president wanted this done under his watch because he takes it very seriously. This is something the president has been watching closely for eight years now. ” Schultz also told the briefing: “We’re going to make public as much as we can. As you can imagine, something like this might include sensitive and even classified information. When that report is submitted we’re going to take a look. We want to brief Congress and the relevant stakeholders, possible state directors. ” “This is good news. Declassifying and releasing information about the Russian government and the US election, and doing so quickly, must be a priority,” said Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee. In October, the director of national intelligence and the secretary of homeland security publicly accused the “ ” levels of the Russian government of directing those digital breaches. Trump, who has treated Russian president Vladimir Putin with a warmth unequalled by most US politicians, has repeatedly dismissed the accusation as politically motivated. US intelligence laid the blame for the DNC hack at Russia’s feet but has not provided evidence supporting the accusation, although several private cybersecurity firms reaching the same conclusion have. Earlier this month, all the Democratic members of the Senate intelligence committee publicly intimated the administration knows significantly more about Russian culpability than the October statement revealed, and implored Obama for a public disclosure he has thus far resisted.  Yet the White House was more sympathetic to a request earlier this week from several senior Democrats in the House of Representatives, who wrote to Obama requesting a classified briefing on the role the Russians played in the election.  While Democrats, stung by a rout in an election many expected to win, have spearheaded the calls for disclosure of Russian interference, they also have some Republican support. Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina hawk who savaged Trump on the campaign trail, told CNN this week he will use his Senate perch to pursue an investigation of Russian involvement in the DNC hack.  According to Monaco, the review will be classified and delivered to lawmakers before Obama leaves office on 20 January.  Democrats immediately pounced on the announced review and pressed the White House to declassify it before Trump takes office. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said Russia had “succeeded” in “sow[ing] discord” in the election, and urged as much public disclosure as is possible. “More than that, the administration must begin to take steps to respond forcefully to this blatant cyber meddling, and work with our allies in Europe who have been targets of similar attacks to impose costs on the Kremlin if we do not, we can expect to see a lot more of this in the near future,” Schiff said Friday.

    "Hillary Clinton supporters spooked by her   victory in Iowa likely woke up Tuesday morning chanting one thing: “firewall. ”  The belief is that once Clinton makes it past the   contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, where Sen. Bernie Sanders has a substantial lead in the polls ahead of next week’s primary, she can bank on a more diverse    and particularly Latinos and      to bulwark her support in the states that follow.  That   plan will get its first true test in Nevada, which hosts a Democratic caucus Feb. 20. It is home to a Latino electorate expected to make up   of the state’s 2016 voters, along with sizable   and   populations. It’s a place where Clinton has invested a considerable ground game, having won a majority of the popular vote in the 2008 caucus but losing in the delegate count to  . Barack Obama. But Nevada is also a state that is still finding its footing on the early primary calendar, meaning she and Sanders don’t have much of a conventional party network to exploit.  “Nevada is different than Iowa and New Hampshire because it’s just new at this. You don’t have those sort of pathways that are well known in those states,” said David  Damore, a political science professor at the University of   Vegas.  It’s that sort of blank slate that might make Nevada attractive to the Sanders campaign    which has amped up its efforts there and has already shown an interest in reaching out to young,   Latino voters, Early numbers suggest that his campaign was he was able to turn out the burgeoning Latino population in Iowa after an notable outreach campaign. “Both the Sanders campaign and the O’Malley campaign were tapping into that youthful population of ours,   caucusgoers, and clearly it gave some additional support to the Sanders’ campaign,” Joe Enriquez Henry    the Iowa director of the  League of United Latin American Citizens    told TPM.  Fifteen out of the 20 biggest districts with a Latino presence went to Sanders, according to Buzzfeed, and combined Latino participation in the Democratic and Republican caucuses grew from 1, 000 in 2012 to more than 10, 000 this year, according to initial exit poll estimates.  “We weren’t hearing much from the Clinton side,” Henry said, of the engagement with Latinos in Iowa. However, the Latino vote has not    by any standard    been ignored by the Clinton campaign in Nevada. Her campaign began building its network last April, according to officials. In May she gave a major early speech there, in addition to the listening sessions she attended with Hispanic residents. She has also picked up the endorsement of a number of state lawmakers, many of whom are participating themselves in the campaign’s    canvassing and voter education efforts. “We knew that the race was always going to tighten,” Jorge Neri, the Clinton camp’s organizing director in Nevada, told TPM. “What we know here is that the work that we did since April, the relationships that we built, the data we collected and the volunteers are what is going to carry us over here. ” Sanders, in the meantime, has been playing a game of  . He has appeared in Nevada frequently, but his campaign only really began to dig into the state in November. He has, however, picked up a few endorsements along the way, including that of Nevada Assemblywoman Lucy Flores. (The Sanders campaign did not return multiple inquiries by TPM). “There is an opening there,” Damore said, of Sanders’ potential for growth in the state. “A lot of Latinos are cynical about politics, they don’t trust politicians all that much. ” However, the Sanders camp has also hit some speed bumps. Its initial Nevada director, Jim Farrell, left the campaign early on, reportedly for family reasons. He has since been replaced by Joan Kato, an alum of Obama’s 2008 Latino outreach team.  More recently, the campaign got in trouble for sending operatives posing as union reps into employee dining halls in order to access workers. The move earned the condemnation of the culinary union  Local 226, which is a major player in the state and plays a crucial role in turning out voters. The union has signaled that it will not endorse a particular Democratic candidate this time around, but favored Obama over Clinton in 2008. Aside from the usual obstacles Latino voters face, Nevada is particularly tough state to mobilize voters    especially for the Democratic caucus, which in Nevada resembles the complicated process in Iowa.   “This is not like other states where they have long ties to a caucus,” Neri, of the Clinton campaign, said. Much of the campaign effort has focused on the   work of cleaning up their voting rolls and teaching potential caucusgoers the process.  “This is a state that is very, very hard,” he said. And as the 2014 GOP electoral sweep in the state showed, Democrats have a long way to go in establishing a dependable infrastructure in the  state. Nevadans are especially transient and many were hit hard by the mortgage crisis. Its residents’ reliance on cellphones also makes even the most basic of polling more difficult. Clinton’s ground game in Iowa did not deliver her the resounding win that could have quieted Sanders’ revolution for good. So the pressure is on her campaign to get a   for its investment in the West.  “They’ve done what they can do. They’ve organized down to the precinct level. She’s got the more established staff members. She comes here, she says the right things,” Damore said. “What Sanders hasn’t shown is that he can go beyond white voters. ” Tierney Sneed is a reporter for Talking Points Memo.

[.@nero Today, alone, #JeSuisMilo has cost $twtr $243, 000, 000. TWTR, you can Stop the bleeding. @Ricky_Vaughn99pic. twitter.   —   Paul Liber (@PaleoLiberty) January 11, 2016, Of course, it’s remotely possible that not every penny of the $243 million value drop was a direct result of Twitter’s inexplicable decision to attack beloved Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos (aka @Nero).  A few dollars of the lost value might be attributable to launching a string of new features and changes that failed to catch on with users, including Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s leaden trial balloon about abandoning the signature feature of the platform, its   message size limit. Twitter has been bleeding users to other platforms for years, and probably isn’t going to win them back by transforming itself into a pale imitation of the platforms they departed for. Wall Street analysts are also said to be worried about Twitter cutting staff without bringing in any exciting new hires, Dorsey’s rather grim requests for patience with a slow turnaround process, years of clashes with outside developers, and the fact that Dorsey divides his attention between Twitter and another company he also manages as CEO. Fox Business discusses $TWTR’s tanking,   low stock price. ”Unexpected”https:  .   —   Prof. Nick Flor ♫ (@ProfessorF) January 11, 2016,  But in all seriousness, picking fights with a substantial segment of its users isn’t helping Twitter in its quest to remain relevant. People are sincerely worried about overt and covert censorship, due to “war on terror” security programs, concessions to authoritarian governments that might otherwise ban social media platforms from lucrative markets, and ideological purges. Conservatives and libertarians have good reasons to suspect content and user controls implemented for other reasons will devolve into political crusades against them. In its heyday, Twitter boasted of being an exciting frontier for freedom of speech, an invigorating arena of ideas where the course of history might be changed, 140 characters at a time. No one wants to hang around while it degenerates into the online equivalent of college campus dominated by snotty crybullies. Stunts like giving people the power to control drones with Tweets won’t restore the reputation for unbridled intellectual energy, constrained by nothing but that   message size limit, that made Twitter a big deal. The stock prices tumbling into oblivion, along with Milo’s   check mark, are sad evidence that Twitter is well on its way to becoming a little deal.  OO. ready( function()  ) })": "43653",
    "Two days after Christmas 1977, police found Shelley H. dead in her apartment in Long Beach, California. The    had been sexually assaulted and strangled: She was lying on the end of her bed, her feet touching the ground, with an electrical wire tied around her neck. Vaginal swabs were taken during her autopsy, but at the time, there was no DNA testing. So the samples went into storage, and the case went cold for the next three decades. Then in 2011, a private DNA lab matched the samples to a man who had lived in Long Beach at the time, Martell Chubbs. The DNA, according to his attorney, is the only evidence linking him to the victim. And these DNA samples were particularly tough to read, tangled with the genetic traces of one or two people in addition to Shelley. What were the chances that the match was correct? Dr. Mark Perlin, the CEO of a Pittsburgh company called Cybergenetics, said his computer program could figure it out. In pop culture, DNA is often portrayed as a magical piece of evidence that links perpetrators to crimes and exonerates the innocent. But deciphering it is usually much messier in real life, especially in cases like Shelley’s that involve samples of more than one person’s DNA. Over the last decade or so, forensic scientists have come to realize that traditional methods for interpreting these “mixed samples” are often less reliable than previously thought. Now, Cybergenetics and a handful of other companies are selling a solution: software that claims to interpret mixed DNA with a high degree of accuracy. These companies point to several   studies that describe the underlying mathematical concepts of their programs, as well as results of mock testing in which they correctly interpreted known samples. But here’s the problem, according to some attorneys and geneticists: These companies claim that the details of how the computer programs carry out their calculations, spelled out in their source codes, are trade secrets. So there’s no way to independently verify that the programs are pinning the real criminal, critics say. “It’s a black box,” said Angelyn Gates, an attorney based in Pasadena who’s defending Chubbs, now 56, from a murder charge for the 1977 crime. That trial is expected to happen this year in Los Angeles County, and she’s trying to prevent the prosecution from introducing Cybergenetics’ software, called TrueAllele, into court. “You have a defendant’s right to   and determine, ‘How are you saying this is the result in my case? ’” Gates said. In her view, “Perlin says, ‘Who cares about your constitutional rights? I want my money. ’” Since 2009, TrueAllele has been used in more than 500 cases and helped convict robbers, child molesters, murderers, and rapists across the U. S. and the U. K. Another program, STRmix, has been used in thousands of cases in Australia and New Zealand since 2012. Just last month, in two double homicide cases near Pittsburgh, judges rejected both defense attorneys’ requests to examine TrueAllele’s source code. In December, a Michigan judge allowed STRmix to be used in a case, marking one of the first times it has been admitted into a U. S. court. Apart from how well the software works, privacy advocates say it exemplifies an even bigger problem: the growing and often unchecked influence of secret algorithms on society, from Facebook’s News Feed experiment on users’ emotions to the 11 million Volkswagen cars programmed to cheat emissions tests. “In so many things we use now, algorithms are being used to make determinations about us,” said Caitriona Fitzgerald of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which is filing public records requests to reveal TrueAllele’s source code. “Those algorithms are not available to people. ” Given the billions of DNA letters in each human genome, there are myriad ways that one person’s code is different from the next. But such differences are tricky to pin down in a sample with DNA from two or more people, as is often the case with a gun, shirt, or cell phone from a crime scene. Depending on how many people came into contact with the item, and for how long, their unique genetic traces may be present in large or small amounts. Sometimes a person’s genetic markers, or strings of DNA code, partially overlap with others’. And in small or decaying samples, bits of these markers can fade away, and others can sneak in through contamination. Scientists have known these potential limits for at least a decade. Last spring, the FBI notified crime labs that there were errors in the data they’ve used for years to calculate the chances of a match between DNA evidence and a suspect. That spurred Texas to flag thousands of past cases for potential issues involving mixed DNA samples. In a 2013 survey that has not yet been published, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) asked 108 labs to interpret a   sample with four people in it, and as a test, provided the DNA profile of a fake suspect who wasn’t in the sample. Seventy percent of the labs pinned the fake suspect. “At the moment, there are really no national standards as far as interpreting mixed DNA,” said Michael Coble, a research biologist at NIST who helped conduct the survey. The traditional approach for analyzing DNA samples, and attempting to account for extraneous code that’s in the sample due to contamination or degradation, involves throwing out bits of the DNA sequence that appear as either large or small outliers in the sample. This approach works well for samples that include just one person’s DNA. But in mixed samples, it runs the risk of discarding information that could be crucial to making a correct analysis. TrueAllele’s approach, in contrast, considers everything. “We have a method that’s objective, that uses all the data,” Perlin said. TrueAllele runs through up to hundreds of thousands of potential scenarios that might have produced the DNA code in a mixed sample, and calculates the probability of each. Once all the probabilities are calculated, they’re compared with the DNA of a suspect or suspects. Finally, TrueAlelle spits out a ratio: What are the chances that a DNA “match” to a suspect is actually just a random coincidence? One in 100? One in a million? Differing ratios may not always change jurors’ minds, like when one method claims a 1 in 5 million chance of being wrong and another claims 1 in 81 billion (as was the case with a rapist in Pennsylvania). But errors in how these ratios are calculated can really matter when two methods end up with wildly different results, like 1 in 420 versus 1 in 18 billion (as was the case in a fatal 2008 shooting). Ratios can also be contentious in investigations that hinge largely or entirely on DNA evidence, as in the case of Shelley H. ’s unsolved murder. In 2011, in an attempt to restart that investigation, Sorenson Forensics, a private DNA testing company in Utah, analyzed her autopsy sample and detected three people: two sources of sperm (one major, one minor) and the victim herself, according to court documents. Shelley had had a partner, but he wasn’t the major source, the lab found. Long Beach police say they ran the material through a DNA database of local, state, and federal crime labs, then arrested Chubbs upon finding a match. Chubbs was in the system because he was a registered sex offender in California for past crimes that included rape by force, oral copulation with a minor, and sodomy with force on a minor. The chances of the main sperm DNA profile matching an unrelated black person other than Chubbs were roughly 1 in 10, 000, according to Sorenson. But when Los Angeles County prosecutors sent the samples to Cybergenetics for further testing to prepare for trial, TrueAllele put the chances at 1 in 1. 62 quintillion  —   a number with 16 zeros. It’s these vastly smaller odds of misidentification that prosecutors may cite in their case against him. But TrueAllele isn’t only used by prosecuting attorneys, its maker Perlin says. He points to cases like Darryl Pinkins, an Indiana man who is serving a prison sentence for raping a woman in 1989. A TrueAllele analysis suggested that his DNA wasn’t in a sample taken from the scene. So now lawyers at the Wrongful Conviction Clinic at Indiana University are trying to use the results to exonerate him. Although Cybergenetics describes TrueAllele’s mathematical concepts in   papers, it keeps confidential the details of how those basic equations get translated into software. As proof that they work, Perlin points to studies like one with the crime laboratory in Kern County, California. An independent party created 40 mixed samples with DNA traces of two to five people, and lab scientists ran them through both TrueAllele and manual analysis methods. TrueAllele generated the correct results almost every time, while the humans struggled to figure out how many people were in the mix, former lab director Kevin Miller told BuzzFeed News. “I know that if I give it known samples, it works as expected,” Miller said, “so when I give it unknown samples, I have no reason to believe it wouldn’t work the same way. ” Perlin says his company lets anyone try out a free trial, that critics who want to see all 170, 000 lines of source code are missing the point, and that revealing it would expose him to copycats. Even though the technology is patented, he says his   company lacks the money to fight a patent dispute. Five crime labs in the U. S. use the TrueAllele software and hardware, which cost $60, 000, according to Perlin. Other agencies prefer STRmix, including the California Department of Justice, which found that it had “more reproducible and sensitive results with fewer  ” compared to TrueAllele. It has used STRmix in about two dozen cases, a spokesperson told BuzzFeed News. A trio of Australian and New Zealand forensic scientists began working on STRmix around 2009. They, too, have published its mathematical models in scientific journals. Developer John Buckleton told BuzzFeed News by email that “the source code is made available when requested under appropriate supervision conditions” but wouldn’t describe what those circumstances might be. The company declined to reveal the cost, but said its more than 50 customers include the FBI and the U. S. Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory. In December 2014, STRmix learned of a coding error that led the company to redo 22 calculations. The error, fixed within a week, did not significantly change any of the results, STRmix told BuzzFeed News. “No software can claim to be completely ” STRmix spokesperson Stephen Corbett said. Such incidents make more than a few forensic and legal experts wary. Dan Krane, a Wright State University biologist who has testified against TrueAllele, told BuzzFeed News the code would help answer questions about how the software weighs various factors, like how it discerns between signal and noise. “Those dozen or so different questions are individually things that people have been debating and arguing quite vigorously for the last 10 to 15 years. ” If a program says the chances of a match are 1 in a million, “how do you truly know that is the right number rather than 100 million or 10 million?” asked William Thompson, a criminology and law professor at the University of California at Irvine. “Are you going to run it a trillion times or a million times and see how often you get a false result?” Still, not everyone thinks raw code is helpful. “I’m more interested in validation: Does the thing work?” Greg Hampikian, the director of the Idaho Innocence Project, who works with Cybergenetics on wrongful conviction cases, told BuzzFeed News. “The results are clear from the studies I’ve seen. ” Fitzgerald of the Electronic Privacy Information Center suggests a compromise: that lawyers and experts could review a program’s code if they signed agreements to not reveal or copy it. Another alternative is free   software like LRmix Studio, created by data scientist Hinda Haned. Haned and her colleagues constantly receive feedback from users of the software, one of whom recently flagged a coding mistake. “I don’t think you have to be   to be good software,” Haned said, “but it’s difficult to interact with other scientists when there is this layer of secrecy. ” Chubbs has pleaded not guilty to Shelley’s murder. Gates, his attorney, had requested to have TrueAllele’s source code disclosed, but last year a court of appeal said she didn’t sufficiently demonstrate why she needed it. Now she is asking prosecutors to prove that TrueAllele is accepted in the scientific community in order to introduce it in court. TrueAllele’s report of the swab samples makes the DNA match to Chubbs look all but ironclad. The public believes DNA is largely infallible and to hear Cybergenetics and similar companies tell it, that’s still true. “I have a problem with the courts or any judge or anybody else,” Gates said, “putting Perlin’s financial gain over a person spending the rest of their life in prison. ”": "105943",
    "Michael Novak loved the Catholic Church and the United States passionately. And with his death at 83, both Church and nation have lost one of their most imaginative and accomplished sons: a groundbreaking theorist in philosophy, social ethics, religious studies, ethnic studies, and economics a brilliant teacher a winsome journalist and apologist a great defender of freedom, as both ambassador and polemicist a man of striking energy and creativity, some of whose books will be read for a very long time to come, and in multiple languages. In his last weeks, however, my thoughts turned, not to Michael’s scholarly and literary accomplishments, which others will celebrate, I’m sure. Rather, I thought of the man I knew for almost three and a half decades, and with whom I shared various adventures. Some of them, recollected here, may shed light on aspects of his character that might have escaped the attention of his admirers, as they certainly escaped the attention of his detractors. When I moved to Washington, D. C. the following year, I quickly came to see how Michael Novak and his good friend James Billington, then the director of the Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars, were making the nation’s capital an environment in which religiously informed moral reason was in play as in no other great world center. Jim Billington did this by quietly ensuring that the Wilson Center’s fellows included theologians and religious philosophers with a feel for applying their craft to the contingencies of political life, and then putting them in touch with the town’s movers and shakers. Michael did it by being himself in conversation with a wide range of Washingtonians, and by helping make the American Enterprise Institute a think tank where the software side of the democratic project was scrutinized for its weaknesses, and where possible improvements, informed by the biblical view of the human person, were imagined. There was nothing like that, then, in London or Paris and there isn’t today. But there is in Washington, and that is in no small part due to the work and the personal example of Michael Novak. Sweating it out in Naples. In the early 1990s, Michael, Richard John Neuhaus, and I all had books published in Italian editions by Mondadori, and the firm’s chief, the estimable Leonardo Mondadori (whose ardent Catholicism coincided with a social circle that included Bianca Jagger) insisted that we all come to Italy for presentations of our books in various forums. Even worse awaited us in Naples, where Leonardo Mondadori had arranged for a more academically focused session at which three Italian professors would discuss our books with us. Or so we thought. The event was held in a reconditioned monastery in the hills above the city, but despite the altitude the room was infernally hot and the Italian colleagues were infernally  . An hour and a half into the program, neither Michael, nor Richard, nor I had said a word, and Richard’s patience was wearing thin. When the Italian academics finally quieted down, Richard began by saying that, given the hour and the temperature, he would follow the dominical injunction to “Be merciful as your heavenly Father is merciful” (Luke 6. 36) and confine his remarks to five minutes I followed suit. But Michael, sensing that something more was expected of us, saved the evening by talking with great clarity and precision about the contributions John Paul II had made to Catholic social doctrine, explaining how these ought to be of interest to even the most   Italians. It was a bravura performance, and a lesson in patience and perseverance that I tried to follow in the years ahead. Take me out to the ballgame. It must have been in the mid 1980s when I took Michael to old Memorial Stadium in Baltimore for an Orioles game on a glorious spring evening. There was one feature of that old    horseshow that never failed to move me: As you came up one of the cement ramps to the upper deck, you caught a glimpse of the infield and a part of the outfield beneath the overhanging mezzanine section of the ballpark. That first sight of the greensward each season was always redolent of renewal, and as Michael and I shared that sense of vernal reawakening, the sharp crack of a   ball leaving an ash bat and heading for the bleachers rang through the stadium. “Greatest sound in sports,” I said. “Except for ‘swish,’” Michael immediately replied, thus revealing himself as a hoops man at heart. I’ve watched countless hours of games with a vast number of people over the past six decades, on site or on television: but I have never met anyone, anywhere, who got such intense pleasure out of sports as Michael Novak did. And not “intense” in the Bill Belichick sense of the   scowl, but “intense” as in sheer pleasure. Michael being Michael, that passion for our games overflowed into his writing, including the book he wanted to call “Balls” until an antsy editor talked him into something a little more, er, delicate: The Joy of Sports. But whatever the title, it was a book replete with insights that could come from only a passionate fan who had played the games and then thought seriously about them: baseball’s freedom from clock time as a signal of transcendence and its unique combination of individual achievement and team play as the embodiment of the “communitarian individual” football as “the liturgy of the bureaucratic state. ” The thought of never having the opportunity to watch another game with him, swapping stories and   managers and coaches, is not a happy one. But if heaven is the perfection of earthly goods, we’ll pick up the conversation in a place without instant replay, because the umps and refs always get it right. Teacher par excellence. In 1992, Michael started a summer seminar in Catholic social thought that I took over in 1999, and that will have its 26th session in Cracow in July. As various ailments began to wear away at his physical capacities, Michael stopped coming, Cracow not being a city very friendly to people with difficulties getting about. But several years ago he asked if he could participate again, if just for a few days, and I readily agreed. The economics section of the program, of which he was once the star, was being covered by others, so Michael spoke about his first love, philosophy, and the modern experience of nothingness. He was not a histrionic lecturer, but his soft and rather high voice, surprising when you first heard it coming from such a big man, had a mesmerizing quality, and my colleagues on the faculty began to understand why Michael was voted teacher of the year two of the three years he taught at Stanford. But it was less his lectures than his interactions with our students  —   young North Americans and central Europeans, all doing graduate studies  —   that I found most striking. They vied to push his wheelchair along the cobblestoned sidewalks of the city and jammed small restaurants to have lunch with him. He always had time for any number of questions. And in addition to what he brought to our work intellectually, he offered a model of patient counseling and courteous listening that our students will long remember. And it was only then, more than 30 years after we had first begun to collaborate, that I came to understand that Michael  —   author, intellectual, diplomat, counselor to presidents and friend of a pope  —   was, in terms of his professional life, first and foremost a teacher. What gave him the greatest satisfaction was seeing others get the light of understanding in their eyes and the joy of discovery on their faces. He would, I think, be willing to be judged by the world on that, his vocation as a teacher: and the judgment would, if just, be a very favorable one.,": "115423",

    "When Apple unleashed its homegrown Maps app with the release of iOS 6, the app was famously plagued by a seemingly endless stream of bugs, usability problems, and above all else, inaccurate mapping directions. Compounding matters was the fact that Apple Maps lacked many basic features found in competing app programs, with transit directions being a prime example. But as the years passed by, Apple Maps quietly got a lot better: mapping directions improved and Apple finally rolled out integrated transit directions with iOS 9 last year. But it’s not as if Apple Maps existed in a vacuum, which is to say that competing programs like Google Maps and Waze did not sit idly by while Apple Maps improved. As far as Apple Maps has come in recent years, many people are still beholden to Google and Waze.   Well, perhaps the time for Apple Maps to step into its own is finally upon us. With Apple introducing the world to iOS 10 at WWDC on Monday, Apple took a few short minutes to provide us with a glimpse into a completely revamped version of Apple Maps. And while we’ll have to wait and see how the app performs in the wild, the small preview we saw on Monday is extremely encouraging. In fact, Apple Maps may finally be mature enough to stand on its own against   mapping incumbents. For starters, Apple Maps in iOS 10 will introduce an   design that looks a little bit more clean and easier to follow than its predecessor. But more than that, the new version of Apple Maps promises to be a bit smarter. For instance, Apple Maps in iOS 10 will be more proactive. In an example demonstrated in the keynote, users can swipe up from the bottom, where they can easily view suggestions pertaining to travel time and upcoming calendar events. Further, Apple Maps will be able to suggest places where users can stop to get things like gas, food and coffee while en route. The new version of Apple Maps not only makes it easy to search for places like restaurants, but also makes it easy to filter search results with more granularity than ever before. Suffice it to say, the new version of Apple Maps is very  . Another   feature for Apple Maps is the ability to pan and zoom further ahead on the Map screen during   navigation. While seemingly a minor feature, this has long been a sticking point for users who weren’t quite ready to drop apps like Waze in favor of Apple’s own offering. Along with enhanced CarPlay integration, Map extensions and more automated traffic information, Apple Maps finally appears to have graduated from the minor league to the majors. As Eddy Cue boasted during Monday’s presentation, “I can find a restaurant, I can book a reservation (via OpenTable) request a car (via Uber) I can pay for it (via Apple Pay) and I can see when it will arrive, all without leaving the Map app. ” So is Apple Maps now better than Google Maps and Waze? We’re definitely not going to go that far, but at the very least, it’s fair to say that Apple Maps is finally able to compete with those two apps without being laughed out of the room.": "138929",

The network has said that coverage of the debate will begin at 8 pm Eastern, though it is not clear if the debate will begin right then or a bit afterward. You’ll be able to view a live stream online at ABCNews. go. com.    After skipping out on the last GOP debate  —   and losing the Iowa caucuses  —   Donald Trump has announced that he will show up this time. He’ll be joined by Iowa winner Ted Cruz and Iowa ”media winner” Marco Rubio, whose unexpectedly competitive performance in the caucuses has bolstered his prospects for winning the nomination in the eyes of political elites. Ben Carson, who finished a weak fourth in Iowa and whose candidacy has been in decline for months, will also be in attendance, though his campaign seems like it might not be going for too much longer. Watch: Ted Cruz trolls Donald Trump in opening remarks of last Republican debate      Then there are three other candidates  —   Jeb Bush, John Kasich, and Chris Christie  —   who are desperately hoping for a strong performance in Tuesday’s New Hampshire primary to keep them in the race. Bush, Kasich, and Christie, who are all   candidates, are all considered rivals to Rubio, who did far better than them in Iowa. So expect them to make a last attempt at taking Rubio down at tonight’s debate.    Conversely, the debate gives Rubio a big opportunity to outshine those establishment rivals right before the New Hampshire primary. If Rubio outperforms Bush, Kasich, and Christie in the Granite State too, they’ll all likely drop out of the race soon  —   clearing the way for Rubio to be the mainstream Republican alternative to Trump and Cruz. If Rubio stumbles in New Hampshire, though, the race could remain muddled for a bit longer.    Since the GOP field has shrunk, there will be no undercard debate for candidates who aren’t polling as well this time around.

    "If you reflect on Adam Serwer’s dissection of the   credentials that Republicans fabricated for Senator Jeff Sessions when he was nominated to be attorney general the scathing 1986 letter that Coretta Scott King sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee, imploring them not to confirm Sessions as a federal judge due to his callous opposition to   activists the attempt Elizabeth Warren made to read King’s letter during Senate debate about whether to confirm Sessions as attorney general and the widespread anger Mitch McConnell evoked when shutting her down with a procedural rule against impugning a fellow senator then it might surprise you that Rubio, a   senator who trades on his moderate image, would make a public spectacle of standing with the GOP here. Yet the Florida lawmaker took to the Senate floor, ostentatiously defending the censoring of his Democratic colleague (albeit before the backlash) by giving a short speech in defense of rules on comity: Did he pull it off? “Turn on the news and watch these parliaments around the world where people throw chairs at each other, and punches, and ask yourself how does that make you feel about those countries?” Rubio said. “It doesn’t give you a lot of confidence about those countries. Now I’m not arguing that we’re anywhere near that here tonight, but we’re flirting with it. We’re flirting with it in this body and we are flirting with it in this country. We have become a society incapable of having debates anymore. ” He continued: In this country, if you watch the big policy debates that are going on in America, no one ever stops to say, “I think you’re wrong, I understand your point of view —  I get it. You have some valid points, but let me tell you why I think my view is better. ” I don’t hear that anymore. Here’s what I hear, almost automatically, and let me be fair, from both sides of these debates. Immediately, immediately, as soon as you offer an idea, the other side jumps and says, “The reason why you say that is because you say you don’t care about poor people, because you only care about rich people, because you’re this, or you’re that or you’re the other. ” And I’m just telling you guys, we are reaching a point in this republic where we’re not going to be able to solve the simplest of issues because everyone is putting themselves in a corner where everyone hates everybody. Rubio argued that his forbearers in the Senate “understood that that debate was impossible if in fact matters became of a personal nature,” and that “this body cannot function if people are offending one another, and that’s why those rules are in place. ” He expressed gratitude that when Hillary Clinton and John Kerry were nominated for cabinet positions, their characters were not impugned during Senate debate, even though so many partisans have such strong feelings about them. He made the case that decorum in the Senate is one of the things that makes possible the smooth functioning of an institution that is a lynchpin of American democracy. “If we lose this body’s ability to conduct debate in a dignified manner,” he concluded, “then where in this country is that going to happen? What other forum in this nation is that going to be possible?” He added: “If this body is incapable of having those debates, there will be no place in this country where those debates can occur. I think every single one of us, to our great shame, will live to regret it. ” Now, it is possible to agree that comity is important, and to applaud a reminder of its importance at a time when the nation is short on constructive disagreement, without believing that Senator Warren should have been silenced. Surely typical debate among senators —  when it is best to focus on the substance of policy and avoid attacks on people —  can be distinguished from a debate about whether one among them is morally fit to be confirmed to a position in the executive branch. Surely it is important to have a frank, fully informed debate about anyone appointed to a position as powerful as attorney general. Surely if a senator nominated to that position has done awful things, the best course is not to simply pretend they never happened or that a robust debate can occur while observing that conceit. If robust debates in those rare, unique circumstances really threaten the institution, then senators should be forced to resign before their nominations are debated. To simply subject senators to less scrutiny smacks of   corruption. At a time when faith in the legislature is low that too is a fraught course. Yet despite believing that Rubio is decisively wrong in this case —  that he could’ve found three dozen better pegs to make a case for comity and civility in our political culture —  I do hope Rubio’s general reminder about the value of comity does good. “I think what’s at stake here tonight and as we debate going forward is not simply some rule, but the ability of the most important nation on earth to debate, in a productive and respectful way, the pressing issues before us,” he said. That is an urgent concern. I also wonder if his remarks were substantially, if rather coyly, aimed at Donald Trump. “If the Senate ceases to work. .. given everything else that is going on in politics today, where you are basically allowed to say just about anything. .. ” he said. “For I have seen over the last year and half things said about people, about issues, about institutions in our republic, that I never thought I would see. Ever. Ever. ” What might “Little Marco” be referencing? That’s when I had a sudden vision of the Florida senator who promised he wouldn’t run for president again, but felt compelled to announce he would challenge Trump, or depending on events, Mike Pence, in the 2020 Republican primary, “in the hope of restoring honor to the White House, pride to the U. S. Armed Forces, and comity to the American people, who used to get along well enough to cooperate despite their disagreements. ” That’s as likely a play for the White House as any, right? If I seem cynical, I do think Rubio truly believes in conducting himself with more comity than many —  certainly more than Trump. And we all know, for all his lofty words about the body he nearly quit, that Rubio would rather be president. If Trump wins reelection, the chances that Rubio gets elected next are slim. Jeb Bush isn’t coming back in 2020. Ted Cruz has ruined any reputation he had for being principled (and if he seems like a threat, Trump can appoint him to the Supreme Court). The odds of any prediction being correct this far out are long, so I’ll put it this way: I can’t imagine Trump running unopposed for the GOP nomination, and I don’t see anyone better positioned than Rubio to run.": "74104",
    "In February, during New York Fashion Week, the audience at the Hood by Air show had a “moment,” one of those rare shocks that jolt you out of your catwalk stupor and stick with you long after the lights have dimmed. It came courtesy of a model named Hirakish, who careened down the runway in a   suit and spiky   bootees, and who proceeded to go   and to spend the rest of the show running in and out of the stands, interrupting other models’ struts and otherwise joyfully, and challengingly, sticking his   feet in our faces. I thought of this on Thursday when the news came that Prince Rogers Nelson, the diminutive musician with the oversize talent, had died. Unlike David Bowie, another musical icon who recently passed away, Prince was not often   by designers as a collection reference. Though fashion played a big part in his image, as the many slide shows making their way around cyberspace attest, and though he made a surprise guest appearance in 2007 at Matthew Williamson’s 10th anniversary show, serenading the attendees and grinding with dancers and models (as one of the attendees, I can tell you, that was another “moment”) he wasn’t a   aesthetic inspiration. Prince refused to adhere to genres in clothing, just as he refused to adhere to genres in music, which meant he tended to ooze into the designer imagination, instead of immediately leaping to mind. But in the way he assumed the tropes of kitsch femininity  —   lace, ruffles, sequins, peekaboo and high heels  —   and transformed them into the vehicles of an    masculine sex appeal, Prince had enormous influence. Most of which can be summed up by the shoe. The high heel was the   of his wardrobe for the four decades he was in the public eye, the consistent base upon which he layered all sorts of style and character changes. Prince wore heels when he barely wore anything at all (just bikini bottoms and a trench coat) he wore them in “Purple Rain” and with baroque brocade he paired them with pastel suits,     jumpsuits he wore them with white hippie tunics at Coachella and slinky metallic gold at the Grammys he wore them offstage, out to dinner in Sweden in 2013, and, according to Mike Tyson’s memoir, “Undisputed Truth,” to play basketball. He wore them so much that there were rumors he needed hip surgery. And he wore them, he said, not because he wanted to be taller, but because “women like ’em. ” He wore them as they were originally designed to be worn, as demonstrated in “Standing Tall,” an exhibition last year at the Bata Shoe Museum in Toronto about men in high heels: as an expression of power and privilege reserved for male royalty, and only later   by women in the 17th and 18th centuries. It made some sense. His name, after all, was Prince. And in doing so  —   in wearing them so regularly, unapologetically (he did not hide behind the acceptably masculine heels of cowboy boots) and effectively  —   he transformed the idea of men in heels to possibility from joke. On women, heels suggest sex Prince showed they could function the same way for men. It is a meaningful part of the equation that has added up to the current trend toward gender fluidity in fashion. Which, let’s face it, really means men in women’s wear, since women have been borrowing from men’s wear for decades. Put another way: There was Prince, and then there was Hedi Slimane’s fall 2015 men’s wear show for Saint Laurent, with its   heels the heels in the men’s wear collections of Rick Owens and Gareth Pugh (and Hood by Air) and the black velvet midcalf heeled boots Kanye West wore in Paris last year, to name just some examples. In the end, his shoes were, as Prince once sang, a sign o’ the times.": "24846",

I just didn’t think that was ever for me, but I was scouted on Instagram and signed haphazardly. ” Fast forward two years later, Majors is one of 36 finalists out of 5, 000 who submitted a   video to Sports Illustrated on Instagram, with the applicants explaining why they should be a part of the magazine’s annual Swimsuit edition. The winner, to be announced at a later date, will be part of next year’s issue.  on  The finalists include students, aspiring reporters, actresses and models of all shapes, sizes and body types. They were broken up into two groups for morning and afternoon shifts last Friday at The Foundry’s offices in Industry City. The first group, which arrived on set at 9 a. m. took part in a photo shoot either before or after making their case in person to Sports Illustrated Swimsuit editor MJ Day. “I thought about running through lines, anticipating questions that would be asked in the interview   …     [but] that’s not what they want to hear,” Majors recalled of her preparation. “Obviously, you have to look good, they want you because of what you look like, but they also want you because of your personality and I think that was most important to me, so I just   that stuff that I prepared and came in like it was just a regular day, talking to anybody. ” Majors found her interview with Day to be relaxed  —   “we spoke about ping pong and Nashville the whole time,” she said  —   which matched her demeanor on the set. For others, such as Miss USA 2015   getting the chance to prove themselves to Sports Illustrated has been a   goal. “I was a little kid and I found these issues and I was like, ‘These are the most empowered, confident women,’” the    actress said. “I’m sure that’s what every parent wants their little girl to say. ”  on  Jordan has been modeling and acting for the past several years since her beauty pageant. Getting her foot in the door was only half the battle, she explained. “Sometimes there’s a stereotype, so people have to get past that and I sort of have to convince people to let me in the room and take me seriously as an actress,” she said. Former Patriots cheerleader   is the stunning beauty   of Patriots star tight end Rob Gronkowski. But she has struggled to find work in the modeling world since moving to Los Angeles to chase her dream. “I’ve been trying to sign with a big, reputable agency that would bring me to Sports Illustrated so that I could be a part of their casting,” the TV reporter said. “I was turned down by a bunch because of my height, my hip measurements. ” By allowing the public to participate, Kostek, 25, believes Day is ahead of the curve where model scouting is concerned.  on  “A lot of times when you go to castings you need to be on your thinner side or whatever, so this was so awesome to go into and know that they’re going to love you as is. Whatever your measurements are, they will accept you. It’s refreshing,” Kostek said. One finalist is guaranteed to be part of the 2018 edition. Should Majors be selected, she wants to show the world models vary in shapes and body types. “This is   moment for women who are featured in the magazine. I realize the prestige of it, but I just want every woman to feel like they’re equally represented in mainstream media,” Majors said. “I’m the biggest girl here. I proudly flaunt myself in a string bikini all the time, and I want girls to realize that’s OK, and if you get looks or whatever, screw those people because it’s just insecurities for themselves that they’re projecting on to you. “If I can just show women, and I feel like I get this question all the time: ‘How are you so confident?’ I feel like that is such an intangible thing to try to describe, so I just try to show them in my confidence.

    "Actor Michael Shannon has a theory about how Donald Trump won a decisive victory in the presidential election earlier this month  —   namely, that the United States is full of “ignorant jackasses” who voted for him. [In an interview with RogerEbert. com’s Nick Allen earlier this week to discuss his latest film, Nocturnal Animals, the    actor said called those who voted for the Republican candidate over Democrat Hillary Clinton “so goddamn stupid” and said the eight years of Obama’s presidency now “feels like a lie. ”  “The big red dildo running through the middle of our country needs to be annexed to be its own country of moronic assholes,” Shannon told the outlet. “You can call it the United States of Moronic Fucking Assholes. ” When asked by Allen whether those who voted for Trump were always assholes or whether they’d become them over time, Shannon unloaded: I don’t know how people got so goddamn stupid. But it’s really weird, because it’s like the last eight years, now it feels like a lie. Like, this has been festering underneath the whole time. Racists, sexists. And a lot of these people, they don’t know why the fuck they’re alive. They know it. They’re doing drugs, fucking killing themselves. Because they’re like, ‘Why the fuck am I alive? I can’t get a job, I don’t know anything about anything, I have no curiosity for life or the world.’ So this Trump thing is like getting a box of firecrackers, or something. It’s like, ‘Well, this will be fun for a little while, this’ll kill some time.’ Because, y’know, the jackass will be amusing on television, stay stupid shit. Make everybody clap. Hillary would have been too boring, I suppose. It’s the worst thing that’s ever happened. It’s the worst. This guy is going to destroy civilization as we know it, and the earth, and all because of these people who don’t have any idea why they’re alive. Shannon, who earned an Oscar nomination for his role in the 2008 film Revolutionary Road, said that despite being an   actor, he hasn’t lost touch with the real world. “I don’t mean to sound cocky, but I guess the one thing I always try to do, I always resist the notion that I’m sort of star or something,” he said. “I still walk down the street, take the subway, try and stay in the real world as much as possible.

    "Little Rock, Ark. is the latest front in the ongoing battle over Ten Commandments monuments on government property. A    granite monument of the Commandments was installed on the grounds of the Arkansas State Capitol on Tuesday, flanked by the state senator who raised the money to pay for it and sponsored the legislation that required it. ”We have a beautiful Capitol grounds but we did not have a monument that actually honored the historical moral foundation of law,” Republican Sen. Jason Rapert told reporters. ”And today we have now, through the support of people all over the country, mostly from Arkansas, been able to erect this monument at zero taxpayer expense.” In 2015, the Arkansas Legislature passed   legislation that paved the way for the monument. The Ten Commandments Monument Display Act requires the Secretary of State to permit and arrange for the monument. The law cites the Supreme Court’s 2005 Van Orden v. Perry decision, which allowed the Texas State Capitol to keep its Ten Commandments monument in place. Nonetheless, the Arkansas law anticipates legal challenges: ”In the event that the legality or constitutionality of the monument . .. is challenged in a court of law,” it says, the Attorney General may either ”prepare and present a legal defense of the monument” or hire Liberty Institute to do so. The American Heritage and History Foundation, an organization founded by Rapert, raised the money to pay for the monument. Rapert says he is on the foundation’s board and that he makes no money from it. The ACLU of Arkansas says it will sue to remove the monument from the Capitol grounds. ”At a time when we do not need any more religious conflict and divisiveness in the world and in this country, it violates the First Amendment promise of religious liberty to all,” Rita Sklar, the group’s executive director, told NPR. ”By placing a monument to a particular set of religious beliefs, it appears that the state enforces one particular set of beliefs over others and over no religion. And it makes people who fall into those categories  —   no religion or other religion  —   feel like   citizens in the state of Arkansas, which they are not.” The monument suggests that the Commandments are the basis for American and Arkansas law, she says, even though ”several of the commandments are wholly religious in nature, like ’having no other gods before me,’ or keeping the Sabbath. Those have no purpose in U. S. or Arkansas law.” Rapert has made headlines with his legislation before. In 2013, he sponsored the country’s strictest abortion law, which was eventually blocked by a federal appeals court. And earlier this year, he sponsored a bill to take Bill and Hillary Clinton’s names off the Little Rock airport. Does Rapert believe in a separation of church and state? ”We have freedom of religion, that’s not freedom from religion,” he tells NPR. ”You have to remember, the State of Arkansas, through a legal process, said that they want to have a monument to the Ten Commandments for the Capitol grounds.” He calls the expected lawsuit by the ACLU ”foolhardy.” ”The ACLU has a history of what I call frivolous lawsuits. It’s very sad in this day and time,” he says. ”The Supreme Court of the United States has said these monuments don’t violate the Establishment Clause. This is America, and if they want to spend their money on this, they can do that. But it’s not the right thing to do.” Sklar says the ACLU of Arkansas has won similar battles over the Ten Commandments in classrooms and courtrooms, and she says the Van Orden decision doesn’t protect the new monument at the state capitol, either. The court distinguishes between longstanding, historically significant buildings, she says, ”that have had religious monuments or symbols for decades and decades, which is the case in Texas, and erecting a completely new religiously divisive monument [like that at] the Arkansas State Capitol. The Court sees a huge difference between the two, and so do we.” And she says that it’s Arkansas lawmakers who are wasting money  —   taxpayer money. ”It cost the state hundreds of thousands of dollars when we challenged their abortion ban. Talk about foolhardy.” Sklar says the Ten Commandments monument does what she believes Rapert and others intend: to assert ”that Christianity in part has some special place in American tradition, has a higher place, has a more important role.” ”It does what it sets out to do, which is to get people from other religions to feel unwanted and unequal.”": "165998",
    "(CNN) Well, I’ll be the first to admit, I got caught off guard on this one. If indeed the assessment of the cockpit voice recording of Germanwings Flight 9525’s final moments is an accurate one, it is shocking. It is inconceivable to me that a fellow pilot would use an airplane for his demise and the demise of his passengers. It is my hope that there is more to this uncanny, horrific tragedy than just an extraordinary suicide event. Although a report of normal breathing from the   in the moments before the crash indicates that he was not incapacitated, how can one really tell? A farfetched idea, but could he have suffered a fit of schizophrenia never diagnosed, or suffered some other mental disorder, perhaps brought on by medication? I know, it’s not likely. As an airline pilot, I’m taking this incident personally. Why? A pilot betrayed the public trust. With all the other fears    terrorism, disappearances of planes, aircraft malfunctions    how do I reassure my passengers that they should not add medical illness, mental or otherwise, of the pilot to the list? For the moment, I’ll have to believe that my customers are intelligent enough to realize that the Germanwings   is an anomaly. Sure, as with any profession, pilots have isolated cases of   troubles. But we have mechanisms to deal with such problems. One mechanism is very simple: Don’t fly. It is incumbent upon us to determine our own fitness for duty. As a matter of fact, on every trip, I have to confirm that status before I electronically sign the flight plan. Whether it’s as simple as suffering from the common cold or suffering from the distraction of a nasty divorce, airline pilots can just say ”no” to flying. As part of the hiring process, we completed a psychological evaluation. With my airline, one part of the evaluation involved a written test that asked obscure questions in different ways. Another part of the test involved pilots listening to an air traffic control recording made during the angst of a thunderstorm event while at the same time completing a battery of math and   problems. We were then asked questions specific to the conversations between the air traffic controllers and pilots we’d heard in the recording. The test was a measure of our multitasking abilities and our abilities to deal with stress. In addition, the airline’s doctor conducted an individual mental evaluation. Airline pilots in the United States are required by the Federal Aviation Administration to take a medical examination once every six months. The examination is mostly physical, but the doctor is expected to ask some basic mental health questions, most of them about depression or alcohol consumption. In addition to requiring pilots to indicate any prior health issues during the previous six months, the application for the exam also compels us to   the use of medications, specifically for the treatment of depression.  If we have consulted a therapist, that also has to be disclosed. Yes, all bets are off if we deceive the system by hiding things from it, but by every indication, this rarely occurs. The consequence for deception is having your FAA pilot’s license suspended. When it comes to experiencing stress, airline pilots are no different than anyone else. But we tend to deal with stress internally. I have been trained as a peer support volunteer in   stress management, a joint program between the pilots union and my airline uses as a debriefing method to talk pilots through any serious event experienced in flight.  The idea is to mitigate any   stress associated with such an event, and occasionally the process would uncover personal issues that would be referred to other support providers, like mental health professionals. I have found that my colleagues demonstrate an   ability to compartmentalize their problems and not let personal issues affect their job performance . .. most of the time, of course.  If personal issues invade the cockpit, mechanisms are in place to assist. What mechanisms? At my airline, both the company and the pilot’s union work in unison. Programs to assist a pilot experiencing problems are just a phone call away. And if there is concern about a colleague’s mental health, we can contact one of these programs on the other pilot’s behalf, anonymously if necessary. In some circumstances a pilot can be removed from duty. At every recurrent training period, the curriculum includes a presentation reminding us of these mechanisms. No system is perfect. Yes, as with all human systems, somebody will fall through the cracks. Even a good psychiatrist can miss an impending suicide. Redesigning an airplane cockpit based on the infinitesimal chance that another Germanwings   is out there seems like an overreaction.  If passengers require reassurance of my sanity, then it would be best to more actively promote the mechanisms already in place. We can start with education.  As I fly back from London today, I am certain that the Gulf War Air Force hero beside me, who dealt with enemy missiles and raising a family, will do nothing other than an exemplary job.

    "Donald Trump faces a   presidential debate on Sunday night after a torrid 10 days left him trailing Hillary Clinton in opinion polls in key battleground states. With early voting already under way, the Republican candidate has seen his September polling gains wiped out and is fast running out of time to shift momentum back his way in the race for the White House. A live debate always raises the prospect of the   Trump allowing Clinton to get under his skin and making a gaffe that could throw his campaign into disarray. The bombastic billionaire stirred fresh controversy on Friday when, in a meeting with a union representing border patrol agents, he floated a new conspiracy theory, saying that immigration officials were trying to expand the pool of American voters. Trump directly challenged the media to report his remarks, which followed comments by union   Art Del Cueto in a meeting in Trump Tower in New York. Del Cueto told the celebrity businessman: “Immigration is so tied up with trying to get the people who are on the waiting list to hurry up and get them their immigration status corrected . .. so they can go ahead and vote before the election. ” “Big statement, fellas,” Trump said, motioning to reporters. “You’re not going to write it. That’s huge. But they’re letting people pour into the country so they can go and vote. ” Clinton was widely judged the winner of the first debate. Both candidates face a test of stagecraft on Sunday in what has become popularly known as a “town hall” format for their second showdown in St Louis, Missouri, moving around a stage with handheld microphones as they field questions from voters. The first town hall debate was held during the 1992 election. As a voter stood to ask George H W Bush about the national debt, the president glanced down at his watch, an image that seemed to reinforce criticism that he lacked empathy. Clinton’s husband Bill won the election. In 2000 George W Bush was answering a question on leadership during such a forum when   Al Gore rose from his chair and walked peculiarly close to his Republican rival. Bush turned and gave Gore a nod and a smile, prompting audience laughter.  Rick Tyler, a political analyst and former spokesperson for Republican primary candidate Ted Cruz, said of Trump: “From what I can tell from the polls, his prospects in the election are bleak. He’s going to need a   win in the debate if he’s going to stand any chance in November. ”  But the town hall format will not necessarily suit him. “He’s just not an impressive performer when it comes to answering people’s questions,” Tyler added. “He’s not grounded in policy, foreign or domestic. He doesn’t give a lot of thought to issues. He’s missing empathy when someone asks a question, he has trouble connecting at their level. “I think she’ll win it. She has so much more experience at this. She comes across as cold, but she has more skills than he does. ” According to the Real Clear Politics polling average, Clinton is currently 4. 5 points ahead of her Republican opponent in a   race, a poll position that would translate to at least 237 of the 270 electoral college votes she needs to win firmly in the bag, with 165 for Trump and 136 to play for.  There is a glimmer of hope for Trump, however, in polls that show him down but not out in the key swing states that are likely to determine the election outcome, and that suggest his dismal showing in the first debate had only a marginal impact. A survey by Quinnipiac University on 8 September, taking smaller parties into account, gave Clinton a  % lead over Trump in Florida,  % in North Carolina and  % in Pennsylvania. It had Trump up by  % in Ohio. Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, told a conference call on Friday: “Debates are obviously the kind of events that make it possible to have   influence. Right now it’s a pretty fair consensus of our polls and other people’s polls that Secretary Clinton seems to have a small lead, maybe three, four, five points nationally. “In some of the swing states, there’s some results that are just plain different. So we enter the next debate with Mrs Clinton slightly ahead but not gigantically ahead. The other interesting question is how the debates will affect the presidential race. ” The Quinnipiac survey found that likely voters said by margins of more than    that Clinton won the first debate. Brown added: “The poll taken right after that debate happened found there had been a relatively small increase in support for Mrs Clinton, not nearly as large as one might expected given the overwhelming consensus that Mrs Clinton won that debate. ” Brown noted that a large percentage of the electorate in states such as Florida and Ohio will have voted by election day due to   provisions in those states. This is likely to intensify pressure on Trump to arrest Clinton’s momentum. Ahead of Sunday, Trump has reportedly reviewed video of the first presidential debate, and his aides have stressed a need to stay calm and not get riled. He limbered up at a real town hall on Thursday night in New Hampshire but did not interact directly with the audience, taking questions only from a moderator. Trump told the small crowd: “This isn’t practice this has nothing to do with Sunday. This isn’t practice, we just wanted to be here. ” And he made fun of Clinton for preparing in depth. “I said, ‘Forget debate prep.’ I mean, give me a break. She’s resting. She wants to build up her energy for Sunday night. And you know what? That’s fine. But the narrative is so foolish. ” Trump was joined by New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who performed well in the town hall format during his failed presidential campaign and is helping the nominee get ready. The Clinton camp has said it expects Trump to have done more homework this time. “But even if he does show up a little more disciplined than last time, I don’t think he’ll get a second chance to make a first impression,” Clinton spokesperson Brian Fallon said.": "157000",
    "(CNN) FBI Director James Comey announced Tuesday that the bureau would not recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton for her handling of classified documents and sensitive information, which she conducted on a private email server during her time as secretary of state. The end of the FBI’s   investigation comes just weeks before the Democratic convention, during which Clinton is expected to become the party’s nominee for president.  But even as Comey said the FBI wouldn’t recommend charges    the final decision will be made by the Department of Justice    he also delivered a scathing verbal indictment of her behavior. Here are seven quotes from Comey on an issue that is sure to reverberate into the fall campaign: 1. ”Extremely careless” ”Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.” 2. ”Should have known” ”There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton’s position, or in the position of those with whom she was corresponding about those matters, should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation.” 3. ”Especially concerning” ”None of these emails should have been on any kind of unclassified system, but their presence is especially concerning because all of these emails were housed on unclassified personal servers not even supported by   security staff, like those found at agencies and departments of the United States government    or even with a commercial email service like Gmail.” 4. ”Still obligated to protect it” ”Only a very small number of the emails containing classified information bore markings indicating the presence of classified information. But even if information is not marked ’classified’ in an email, participants who know or should know that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect it.” 5. ”Generally lacking” While not the focus of our investigation, we also developed evidence that the security culture of the State Department in general, and with respect to use of unclassified email systems in particular, was generally lacking in the kind of care for classified information that is found elsewhere in the government. 6. ”Hostile actors” ”We do assess that hostile actors gained access to the private commercial email accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in regular contact from her personal account. We also assess that Secretary Clinton’s use of a personal email domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent.” 7. ”Sophisticated adversaries” ”She also used her personal email extensively while outside the United States, including sending and receiving   emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. Given that combination of factors, we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton’s personal email account.”": "55774",
    "The health and science editor at the New York Times told a reader in the newspaper’s “mailbag” feature that she decided not to use the term “female genital mutilation” because it is a “culturally loaded” term that widens the “gulf” between the West and the countries where the abuse is practiced. [“I never minced words in describing exactly what form of cutting was involved, and there are many gradations of severity, and the terrible damage it did, and stayed away from the euphemistic circumcision, but chose to use the less culturally loaded term, genital cutting,” Dugger wrote in response to a reader’s question about the semantics.  Dugger said she made the decision following a trip to Africa in the 1990s. “There’s a gulf between the Western (and some African) advocates who campaign against the practice and the people who follow the rite, and I felt the language used widened that chasm,” Dugger said. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) said that some 200 million girls “alive today” are believed to have suffered the abuse, according to the FAQ portion of its website. “The term ‘female genital mutilation’ is used by a wide range of women’s health and human rights organizations,” the UN website states. “It establishes a clear distinction from male circumcision. Use of the word “mutilation” also emphasizes the gravity of the act and reinforces that the practice is a violation of women’s and girls’ basic human rights. “This expression gained support in the late 1970s, and since 1994, it has been used in several United Nations conference documents and has served as a policy and advocacy tool. ” The website text notes that “female genital cutting” was introduced in the late 1990s because of “concern that communities could find the term ‘mutilation,’ demeaning, or that it could imply that parents or practitioners perform this procedure maliciously. ” In recent days three arrests were made in Detroit where two physicians and one physician’s wife are charged with performing the abuse on minor girls. The three suspects represent the first prosecution in the United States for the practice, which is common primarily in Muslim countries, particularly in Africa.": "30880",
    "BALTIMORE  —   After a string of   defeats, the prosecutors who were unable to win convictions of police officers in the death of Freddie Gray defended themselves on Thursday and sharply accused the city’s Police Department of undermining them. At a news conference the day after their boss, Marilyn J. Mosby, the state’s attorney for Baltimore, announced she was dropping charges against the three officers who still awaited trial, the lead prosecutors  —   both seasoned lawyers  —   said the police had failed to serve search warrants for the officers’ personal cellphones. The lawyers also echoed a charge made in court that a detective assigned to the case was sabotaging it. They disputed a contention by critics that they rushed to bring charges, and said they never doubted their theory of the case  —   or whether they had the evidence to win. “There was sufficient evidence for a rational juror to convict,” Michael Schatzow, deputy chief state’s attorney, told reporters crowded into a conference room in Ms. Mosby’s downtown suite. “We believed in these cases, and we were prepared to fight very hard for these cases. ” The appearance by Mr. Schatzow and Janice Bledsoe, a deputy state’s attorney, was the first time the prosecutors  —   who like all the lawyers, defendants and witnesses had been subject to a strict rule of silence imposed by the judge  —   spoke publicly, outside the courtroom, about a case that has torn apart this city and drawn national attention. The two appeared worn out and at times exasperated  —   “When it comes to frustration, I plead guilty,” Mr. Schatzow said  —   but offered a remarkable look into their thinking, and the potential conflicts between the police and prosecutors who usually work together. It is “extraordinarily unusual” for prosecutors to publicly criticize the police, said David Jaros, a law professor at the University of Baltimore. He said the trials highlighted the need  —   as Ms. Mosby suggested at her news conference on Wednesday  —   for independent investigators and prosecutors to handle police misconduct cases. “There is something problematic,” Mr. Jaros said, “when police officers are asked to investigate themselves and when local prosecutors are involved in these highly politicized,   prosecutions. ” The Police Department has stood by its investigation. In a statement released Wednesday, Commissioner Kevin Davis said “over 30 ethical, experienced and talented detectives worked tirelessly to uncover facts” in the case. A department spokesman said Thursday that the police would “not engage in public banter with our criminal justice partners. ” Mr. Gray, a    black man, was arrested on April 12, 2015, in the blighted West Baltimore neighborhood where he grew up. He sustained a fatal spinal cord injury and died a week later  —   one of a string of deaths around the country of black men at the hands of the police that prompted national outcry, and riots here. On May 1, with National Guard troops on patrol, Ms. Mosby announced that she was bringing criminal charges against six officers. Prosecutors argued that Mr. Gray was improperly arrested, and that he sustained the fatal injury during a ride in a police van, in part because officers failed to put a seatbelt on him and drove the van dangerously. But the first trial ended in a hung jury, and three more ended in acquittals issued by Judge Barry G. Williams of the Baltimore City Circuit Court, prompting the prosecution team to conclude they could not win convictions before him. In Maryland, defendants may choose whether to have a trial by judge or jury. Mr. Schatzow said prosecutors began investigating the circumstances around Mr. Gray’s injury in the days after it happened, and said it was not scattershot or rushed, adding, “I don’t think we felt that there was material that we overlooked. ” Legal experts have noted that timeline fell short of what is typical for federal inquiries, which last months if not years. But the prosecutors laid blame on the police, not themselves. Mr. Schatzow said the lead police detective involved in the inquiry, Dawnyell Taylor, “was doing things without notifying us, and doing things that were counter to what a primary detective should be doing,” and was removed from the case as a result of his complaints. But in court, she denied that she had been removed from the case. And Ms. Bledsoe said that while the police tried to get personal cellphones of the six officers, which might have shown their communications during and after the episode, the department “did not execute those warrants in the correct amount of time, and they expired. ” One of the biggest outstanding questions is what, precisely, happened to Mr. Gray. Some residents here, as well as neurologists who have watched the case from afar, have questioned whether he was injured not in the van, but during the initial arrest, when he was pinned to a sidewalk  —   a scene captured on video that was widely replayed. “Everybody who saw that acknowledged that he couldn’t use his legs properly,” said Mary Anne Whelan, a retired neurologist in Cooperstown, N. Y. who was one of several doctors who in interviews have questioned the narrative about Mr. Gray’s injury. “Somehow or other it’s gotten to be accepted that it happened in the van, but that’s wrong. ” But prosecutors said that video recordings of the arrest, which they said showed Mr. Gray raising his chin off the pavement and later standing on the back bumper of the police van, at least partly supporting his own weight, indicated that he had not yet sustained a paralyzing injury. In the end, Mr. Schatzow said, Ms. Mosby “correctly determined” that while there may have been enough evidence to persuade jurors, they would never convince Judge Williams that the officers had committed a crime  —   despite the judge’s history as a lawyer who once prosecuted police misconduct for the Justice Department. “We had to face the reality,” he said, “that defendants would select judge trials, and that this judge would try the cases. ”": "25082",
    "We’ll level with you: April 2017 is absolutely stacked with new streaming options, to the point where the committed viewer could get away with not leaving the house for the entire month. There’s a true bounty, featuring hotly anticipated original TV series, intriguing new documentaries, underseen recent classics, and some of the best films of last year.    We don’t recommend going quite so far as to forgo the outside world in favor of devouring the streaming riches on offer, but we’re attempting to make it a little easier to plan just how much of April you’ll need to devote to watching All of the Things. We’ve pulled the best options from a variety of services  —   Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, HBO, Showtime, and Starz  —   and arranged them by premiere date. There’s something promising debuting every few days, so bust out the calendar, cancel your social engagements, and start planning how you’re going to get through it all. Premiering April 1  The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (HBO  )  Andrew Dominik’s 2007 release was barely shown in theaters, due to the indifference of its distributor, Warner Bros. But its tale of the life and death of Jesse James  —   as seen through the eyes of his assassin  —   is one of the best movies released since 2000, with grandly poetic images and beautiful performances from Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck.  Godzilla, Mothra, and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters   Attack (Starz)  Godzilla, Mothra, and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters   Attack (GMK) is what   reboots Godzilla and Kong: Skull Island are building to: a gigantic   complete with laser beams, massive furry moths, and   dragons fighting one another. Granted, special effects have gotten a lot better since GMK came out in 2001, but there’s enough silly monster stuff here to keep you entertained and looking forward to 2019’s Godzilla: King of the Monsters.     The Kids Are All Right (Starz)   Midlife crises are collective in Lisa Cholodenko’s   comedy about a modern family thrown into upheaval by the arrival of the sperm donor to two lesbian parents (Annette Bening and Julianne Moore). Awkward as only a liberal dramedy can be, The Kids Are All Right features spotless performances by a veteran ensemble, including a breakout turn from Mia Wasikowska as the curious daughter determined to form a fledgling relationship with her biological dad. What’s great about The Kids Are All Right is that everyone is a mess, and that’s all right too. Plus, Mark Ruffalo gets to play the hot rebel  —   a rare treat.     Teen Witch (Starz)  1989’s Teen Witch is about the most important things in life: high school, magic, mean teachers, true love, and some really   dude named Brad. There’s also a makeover and Zelda Rubinstein, known for her work as the creepy medium Tangina in the Poltergeist franchise, as a slightly less creepy but still strange Madame Serena. Teen Witch is not to be confused with 2016’s The Witch, a horror story about a teenager who eventually becomes a witch  —   but who, unlike Teen Witch’s protagonist, does not have the ability to magically imbue others with rapping abilities.  Premiering April 4  Chewing Gum season 2 (Netflix)  One of Netflix’s recent British imports is the very funny    comedy Chewing Gum.    Michaela Coel is fantastic as the equally gawky and curious Tracey, who in the first season launched herself into the brand new world of sex with such reckless abandon that the results were both hilarious and horrifying. Season two promises more of the same.     Dimension 404 season 1 (Hulu)  Hulu’s answer to Black Mirror is this anthology series about the darkest corners of the internet, produced by the   online video kings at Rocket Jump. The series boasts an amazing cast  —   including everybody from Patton Oswalt to Lea Michele  —   and its vibe looks a little more overtly   than Black Mirror’s dystopian hues. Premiering April 5  Preacher season 1 (Hulu)  This 2016 adaptation of the acclaimed comic book of the same name lacks the kind of overarching storyline that would make it really compelling, but as a delivery mechanism for exciting moments, it’s a lot of fun. Like most   shows, it should play very well in a binge. Hang in there for some of the truly inventive fight scenes, and for the performances of Ruth Negga as the   Tulip and Dominic Cooper as the chaplain with strange powers who gives the series its title. Premiering April 6  The BFG (Netflix)  The most recent film by Steven Spielberg  —   released just last summer!  —   rather crashed and burned at the box office, despite its   premise and children’s literature pedigree. The gentle, lovely little film follows a young girl who meets the Big Friendly Giant of the title, and it’s sprinkled with just enough of the dark horrors of the Roald Dahl novel it’s based on to make it engaging.    Premiering April 7  The Get Down season 1, part 2 (Netflix)  The Get Down’s bizarre release strategy  —   the first season was released in two halves eight months apart  —   and a messy pilot seem to have gotten in the way of buzz for this energetic, enthralling tribute to the Bronx in the ’70s, the early days of   and the creative impulse. Here’s hoping the season’s final five episodes wrap up the storylines in satisfying fashion, because the series may be too expensive for Netflix to renew.  American Playboy (Amazon)  Does the world really need a   “docuseries” about the life of Playboy founder Hugh Hefner? Probably not, but Amazon is giving this one a big push anyway, and its promise of rarely seen footage from Hefner’s archive, alongside scripted scenes starring actors as the young Hef and pals, could make for something intriguing. Premiering April 8  Kubo and the Two Strings (Netflix)   With its gorgeous   design, a tale of adventure and fantasy in Japan, and the borrowed spirit of legendary filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, Kubo and the Two Strings was one of our favorite movies of 2016. Ostensibly about a boy searching for his lost family, Kubo knows what all good stories know  —   that a story reveals as much about the teller as the tale. Laika’s   animation turns every story into a feat, made even more epic by the herculean studio efforts that went into the film’s creation. Kubo features the largest   puppet ever created, and took five years of painstaking labor to finish. The result is pure cinema magic. Premiering April 13  Short Term 12 (Hulu)   Before she was tapped to play Captain Marvel, Brie Larson played a superhero of a more humble sort in Destin Daniel Cretton’s Short Term 12. The film follows the action at a residential group facility for troubled teens, where Larson’s Grace is a senior member of the support staff. Her difficult job takes a toll on her, though  —   particularly affecting her relationship with her boyfriend, who also works at the facility  —   which comes to a head with the introduction of a new resident who stirs up some buried trauma.   The Handmaiden (Amazon)  It’s just about impossible to describe Park  ’s stunning film without ruining the twists, but we’ll give it a shot. Though it was adapted from Sarah Waters’s book The Fingersmith, which takes place in Victorian England, The Handmaiden is set in 1930s   Korea, as an ambitious Korean handmaiden (Kim  ) plots against her charismatic Japanese mistress (Kim  ). But if that sounds straightforward, trust us: it’s not. The Handmaiden is a twisty, sexy thriller that never goes in the direction it’s telling you it is, which makes for one hell of a fun ride.  Premiering April 14  The Love Witch (Amazon)  The Love Witch is lit and shot to look like a 1960s Technicolor film, with costumes and sets designed by   Anna Biller to evoke a vaguely psychedelic fairy     horror   feminist psychosexual dramedy about a woman who’s hunting for a man (literally). If that bizarre combination appeals to you, you’re in luck  —   while The Love Witch leans heavily on its inspirations, it isn’t like anything you’ve seen before. It’s deliciously campy, sometimes shocking, and totally unconventional.     The Babadook (Hulu)   One of the best of a recent wave of outstanding horror films, The Babadook effectively made single motherhood into the ultimate nightmare while propelling its cast and crew into the   limelight. The Babadook delivers a star turn for Essie Davis as Amelia, the mother whose attempts to deal with her hyperactive, perpetually terrified son (Noah Wiseman) leave her exhausted, isolated, and open to the curse of the dreaded Babadook, a ghoulish children’s book monster. (Think Slender Man, but  .) This is already prime horror material, but   Jennifer Kent levels up by turning Amelia’s psychological breakdown into something so raw and scary that it becomes a form of primal feminist rage. If you think you’ve seen this one before, watch it again; it rewards repeat viewings like few films of its ilk.  Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return (Netflix)  Twelve seasons, one epic crowdfunding campaign, one successful offshoot cult website, and an infinite number of     later, Joel and the Bots are back! Longed for by fans of terrible   the world over, MST3K returns for an entire new season with an ensemble of geeky   including Jonah Ray as the host, and Felicia Day and Patton Oswalt as descendants of the original mad scientists who started this whole shebang. Keep an eye on the cult bad flick Reptilicus, which appears to be one of the movies riffed on, and enjoy the kitschy retro look of the comeback. Oh, and look out for MOVIE SIGN! Premiering April 16  Guerrilla (Showtime)  April is a crowded month for new TV, and Showtime’s big entry is this new   miniseries from 12 Years a Slave screenwriter and American Crime creator John Ridley. It follows 1970s political activists as they work to break cycles of police violence in the United Kingdom, and it stars Freida Pinto and Idris Elba, among others. The intersection of social justice and history is a place within which Ridley usually works well, so this is one to anticipate. Premiering April 21  Bill Nye Saves the World, season 1 (Netflix)  A science talk show isn’t the most natural idea in the world, but if there’s anybody who can make it work, it’s the inexhaustible Bill Nye. The first season of his new Netflix series unleashes a torrent of celebrity guests upon a variety of important science topics (climate change! GMOs! sex!) complete with   demonstrations.  Premiering April 22  The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks (HBO)   In 2010, a nonfiction book about the true story behind the world’s most commonly replicated “immortal” strain of lab cells became an unlikely    —   and HBO’s teaser trailer for its new adaptation of the book gives you a taste of how surprising and dramatic that story is. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a strange, harrowing, and deeply moving story of the way corporate greed often consumes and usurps individual identity, even after death. Throw in legendary Broadway director George C. Wolfe working with Oprah Winfrey and Hamilton’s Renée Elise Goldsberry, and this adaptation is a  . (You should probably have tissues ready.) Premiering April 25  Queen of Katwe (Netflix)  Mira Nair’s Queen of Katwe is based on the true story of Phiona Mutesi, an illiterate teenager from a slum outside the Ugandan capital of Kampala who discovers she has a knack for chess, thanks to a missionary (who also grew up in the slums) running a chess club for local kids. Starring Lupita Nyong’o, David Oyelowo, and newcomer Madina Nalwanga, it’s heartwarming and inspirational, but also the opposite of a white savior movie  —   and all the better for it. This is one for the whole family.    Premiering April 26  The Handmaid’s Tale (Hulu)  Margaret Atwood’s dystopian novel  —   about an America overtaken by a   movement that systemically deprives women of their rights  —   is 30 years old, but it has never felt more timely. Hulu’s highly anticipated new TV version is a smart, compelling adaptation that uses Atwood’s novel as a window into a terrifyingly plausible world. Mad Men’s Elisabeth Moss anchors the uniformly excellent cast (including Alexis Bledel, showing sides she never did on Gilmore Girls) but the real star here is the textured, detailed world building and the newfound urgency and immediacy of the story’s dystopian impulse. Premiering April 27  American Honey (Amazon)  British director Andrea Arnold takes a visually stunning, nearly   ramble through   America in this    road movie.   actor Sasha Lane plays Star, a   but naive teenager who falls in with a crowd of rowdy youths; the group  —   overseen by a   Shia LaBeouf  —   traverses the country in a van, selling magazine subscriptions to unsuspecting marks. A rambunctious movie with a lot on its mind, American Honey is a complicated evocation of the freedom that comes with having nothing, and what it means to define yourself outside of possessions. Premiering April 28  Casting JonBenet (Netflix)  In Casting JonBenet, a group of actors in Colorado audition to play characters in a movie about JonBenet Ramsey, the    beauty queen who was murdered in her family’s home the day after Christmas in 1996. Through the audition process, the actors start to reveal what they think about the case and how their own personal experiences shape what they believe. In the process, what we believe about the   case gets more complicated too. Casting JonBenet is a quiet and moving look at how we think about crime in America, and how not just media coverage but also our own lives mess with our sense of objectivity.  Dear White People season 1 (Netflix)  Director Justin Simien adapts his 2014 satirical film into a   TV season, a key part of Netflix’s attempts in 2017 to diversify its original series. The movie was pretty terrific (and funny) as it stood, but it’s not as if the intervening years haven’t given Simien more topics to tackle and issues to raise. And if early episodes are any indication, he’s done so with aplomb.  Catastrophe (Amazon)  The British comedy Catastrophe is a raunchy, delightfully unvarnished look at the challenges of marriage and parenthood, minus most of the clichéd trappings that usually accompany those topics. The painfully funny, eminently filthy series will tread some serious ground in season three, as central couple Sharon and Rob try to keep it together and manage their family of four in the aftermath of a drunken and devastating season two cliffhanger. While that may sound grim, it’s exactly the type of scenario that series creators and stars Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney excel at mining for comedy. The   season also features Carrie Fisher in the last role she filmed before her death on December 27, 2016; Fisher plays Rob’s overwhelmingly critical mother, Mia, and according to Delaney, she’s “a huge part” of the season three finale.  Premiering April 30  American Gods season 1, episode 1 (Starz)  In certain corners of the internet, this Starz adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s novel of the same name is the most anticipated TV series of the year, thanks to both a stunning cast (including old favorites such as Ian McShane and vibrant newcomers like Ricky Whittle) and showrunners like Bryan Fuller and Michael Green. Fuller, in particular, brought the seemingly unadaptable Hannibal Lecter books to TV, and the early episodes of American Gods suggest he might have done the same for this tale of old gods washing up on American shores.  Animal Kingdom season 1 (Amazon)  There’s no reason this TNT adaptation of the 2010 Australian crime drama film should be as good as it is. And indeed, the early episodes take some time to put all the pieces into place. But former Halt and Catch Fire showrunner Jonathan Lisco and his team finally turn the story of a crime boss mother and her fractious sons into a simmering family drama, filled with rage, regret, and secrets. If you liked Netflix’s Bloodline but wished it were 15 percent creepier, this is the show for you.": "197203",
    "(CNN)  Aubameyang and his father are not only bound by blood ties. Father and son have history when it comes to the two defining moments in Gabon’s football past. Twice ”Les Panthères” have made the quarterfinals of the Africa Cup of Nations. Twice they have played out   draws before going out on penalties.  Both times, the team representing this African nation of around 1. 8 million people starred a man named Aubameyang. ”He was captain, now I’m captain, and I’m proud to lead this national team,” Borussia Dortmund striker Aubameyang tells CNN, 16 years after his father’s team lost to Tunisia.  The    knows plenty about carrying the weight of a nation’s expectations.  Gabon’s only other appearance in the last eight of the AFCON came when it   the competition with neighbor Equatorial Guinea in 2012. While it was a success on a personal level for Aubameyang    he scored three goals during the tournament    it was ultimately his miss in the penalty shootout against Mali that meant his team fell short once again. He walked back to the halfway line before collapsing to the turf in tears and, as the stadium emptied, father and son were left to reflect upon another opportunity lost. This year’s tournament offers a chance of redemption.  Gabon might only be 110th in the FIFA world rankings    below the likes of Swaziland, Rwanda and Sierra Leone    but in star man Aubameyang, it boasts one of the world’s deadliest strikers.  And, with Real Madrid legend José Antonio Camacho coaching the team, the 2017 AFCON host nation has real cause for hope.  ”I think it’s a really important challenge,” says Aubameyang. ”We have a good team . .. Why not win this trophy for the first time?” WATCH:   Aubameyang challenges Usain Bolt to a race  Like father, like son, Born in France and invited to play for Italy’s   following a spell at AC Milan, Aubameyang might never have represented Gabon at all, had it not been for the influence of his father, known during his playing days as Pierre ”Yaya” Aubame. ”It’s my culture,” shrugs the Dortmund star, reflecting on their close relationship. ”He taught me so many things about this country as captain of the national team. I lived all the time in France but it’s like I was born in Gabon. ”For me, this choice was easy because my father was my first favorite player. I was in the stadium watching him for the first time when I was maybe three years old, and straight away I knew I wanted to do it like him. That’s it.” Like his father, Aubameyang spent his formative years in French football    cutting his teeth at Dijon, Lille, Monaco and eventually   in a succession of loan deals from parent club AC Milan.  But while the career of his Dad would eventually fade into relative obscurity    comprising stints at Colombian club Atlético Junior and a season back home in his native Gabon    the same cannot be said of the Dortmund forward.  When he broke Ivory Coast midfielder Yaya Toure’s   hold on the award in 2016, Aubameyang became the first ever Gabonese player to be named African Player of the Year. His peers in Germany football voted him the Players’ Player of the Year last season after he scored 25 Bundesliga goals. And, with 16 league goals in 15 appearances so far this campaign, he’s leading the charge for the European Golden Shoe, previously won by football greats such as Gerd Muller, Marco van Basten and Cristiano Ronaldo. If Aubameyang succeeds, he will become the first ever African winner.  Already his nation’s top goalscorer and a 2016 Ballon d’Or nominee, he’s even challenged Usain Bolt to a race. It’s enough to make any father proud.  ”He told me already that he wants me to continue the way I’m going,” smiles Aubameyang, the youngest of three brothers who have all spent time on the books of AC Milan, but the only one to break into the big time.   ”I think he’s happy but every time he tells me ’You can do it better, you can do it better’ and so that’s the way.” The way forward, If Aubameyang has gone from strength to strength, can Gabon go    with Africa’s football powerhouses? First up, the hosts need to navigate a group that comprises Burkina Faso and Cameroon as well as Saturday’s opponents  . ”Every time, we get the best teams,” laments Aubameyang. ”It’s crazy! ”Cameroon are big and it will be a hard game for sure.  But we did well against Burkina Faso last year so I think we have our chances. ”It’s another year but like I said before we have a good team    young players, but talented players, so for sure we have to advance past the first round.” His father will be watching on hoping he does just that.": "50694",
    "While the world watches America’s Cuban exile community celebrate the death of dictator Fidel Castro, those who have governed their own countries similarly have issued official statements of condolences for the communist caudillo, describing him as a “giant” among repressive autocrats who “resisted” the beacon of freedom 90 miles to his north. [Below, five responses from autocrats around the globe to Castro’s passing:  Venezuela: Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s dictator Nicolás Maduro  —   officially losing his status as president after suppressing a constitutionally permissible recall vote petition  —   issued a statement on state radio, comparing Castro to late Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chávez, who was a close ally of the Castro regime. “Amid the pain and the memories, we will always remember aloud our Comandante Chávez,” Maduro said on Saturday. “What a deep friendship they cultivated, a friendship of struggle and values  …     two revolutions harassed by the Empire, that have thrived and must continue to thrive. ” Syria: Bashar   While Syria and Cuba have few common needs as a state, the nations had long been allies on the international stage, voting together to advance the agendas of allies like China and Cuba at the United Nations. Embattled dictator Bashar   took some time out of his Saturday to praise Castro as a “giant leader” who has “throughout the decades led the struggle of his country and people against imperialism and hegemony with all aptitude and capacity. ” “The resistance of the Cuban leader has become legend and an inspiration for all the leaders and peoples of the world,” Assad reportedly said. “The name Fidel Castro will remain etched in the minds of all generations, as an inspiration for all the peoples seeking true independence and liberation from the yoke of colonization and hegemony,” Assad reportedly said.   Russia: Vladimir Putin, Like Castro, Putin has managed to perpetuate himself in power for years, and appears to have no plans of retiring. In his statement, Putin referred to Castro’s as a “free and independent Cuba, which he and his allies built. ” Castro, he claimed, “became an influential member of the international community and became an inspiring example for many countries and nations. “Fidel Castro was a sincere and reliable friend of Russia. He made a huge input in establishment and development of the   relations, close strategic partnership in all spheres,” the Putin statement reads. “He was a strong and wise person, who always faced future with confidence. He demonstrated high ideals of a politician, citizen and patriot, who is adamant in the right course, to which he sacrificed all his life. ” China: Xi Jinping, As a Communist leader in name  —   not just in practice like Maduro or Assad  —   Xi Jinping’s praise for Fidel Castro is to be expected. Xi called Castro a “great leader” in his statement of condolences to the Cuban communists, “adding that he has made immortal historic contributions and devoted all his life to the Cuban people’s great cause of struggling for national liberation, safeguarding state sovereignty and building socialism,” according to Chinese state outlet Xinhua. “The late Cuban leader has also made immortal historic contributions to the world socialist development, Xi added,” Xinhua notes. “The death of Fidel Castro has made the Chinese people lose a close comrade and sincere friend. His glorious image and great achievements will go down in history,” Xi concluded.": "37937",
    "A pair of tennis bad boys were involved in a bizarre altercation with a police officer in Washington who insisted they leave their practice court due to a bad weather forecast. Video from Tuesday’s incident shows the cop stride across the court where Serbia’s Viktor Troicki and Australia’s Bernard Tomic were practicing during the Citi Open tournament, and become increasingly agitated when the pros don’t immediately budge. “You want to knock it off now?” the officer warns Troicki. “Yes? Knock it off. Now. Let’s go. Stop playing tennis. ” The officer is heard mentioning the “severe weather coming in” while Troicki looks skyward quizzically. Then Tomic comes over from the opposite side of the net. “Excuse me, sir? It’s not raining,” Tomic says. The policeman wheels on him and tries to get nose to nose with the    youngster. “Why are you getting so close to me?” Tomic asks. The officer by now is barking orders to “get off the court. ” The complete argument lasts for approximately one minute.

    "Fashion house Gucci is under fire this week after a complaint was filed for its models appearing too thin in two campaign images. The Advertising Standards Authority  —   the independent agency in the UK that ensures ads comply with a certain set of guidelines  —   has now banned one those images from appearing online or in print after it ruled that model Avery Blanchard’s torso and arms were disproportionate to her head and lower body and that she appears far too gaunt in the face. Gucci View Slideshow “For those reasons, [the ASA] considered that the model leaning against the wall appeared to be unhealthily thin in the image, and therefore concluded that the ad was irresponsible,” the  .  The offending image is a still from the brand’s Cruise 2016 ad video. Gucci asserts that the video was intended to be viewed by a more mature audience, and that thinness is a subjective matter  —   the latter of which was upheld by the ASA. Gucci conceded that lighting, makeup and the angle at which the video was shot may have “accentuated the impression of thinness. ” On Wednesday, the ASA agreed that a second image from the same campaign of model Madison Stubbington seated on a sofa was not an irresponsible advertisement, because “her legs, while slim, appeared to be generally in proportion with the rest of her body, which was not excessively slender or underweight  —   for example, her knee and ankle bones were not overly noticeable. ” Still, the ruling comes at a time when female body image is a key subject of discussion across   amplifying the harsh scrutiny on the   fashion brand. The agency concluded that the ad cannot appear again in its current form, but that the images in their ads were “prepared responsibly. ” Given that Alessandro Michele, Gucci’s creative director, is already two seasons ahead, that shouldn’t be an issue.": "143361",
    "Two prominent north Texas Democrats are sounding the alarm on the threat of a   concern: voter fraud. [Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings (D) and State Representative Eric Johnson (  100) submitted a letter Thursday to Dallas County Elections Administrator Toni   after public concerns continued to mount about scores of reports involving a potential absentee voter fraud scheme.  “According to reports, dozens of voters received   ballots they never requested,” the letter states, which “suggests the possibility of a coordinated effort to benefit a candidate or candidates in the upcoming Dallas City Council elections. ” As Breitbart Texas previously reported, the episode began when West   pastor James Armstrong alerted local media and officials alike that some of his congregants came forward with evidence that absentee ballots were arriving at their respective homes without first asking for them, as Texas law requires. “It’s just a travesty that we are dealing with this,” Armstrong told NBC DFW at the time. “Seniors who have lived in this neighborhood all of their life and are now being taken advantage of. ” Another community resident, Alice Washington, 81, lodged similar complaints with the County via her niece, Barbara Roberson. “I said, ‘Would you please send me a copy of that application because I’d like to see her signature’,” Roberson told WFAA at the time. “Someone forged her signature,” said Roberson after review of the paperwork. In the week following, dozens of similar complaints have been made, according to Mayor Rawlings’ joint letter. The duo also notes a possible pattern in recent elections: What’s more startling is that this is the second time in less than a year that we have heard reports of irregularities in West Dallas. In November, media reports indicated someone fraudulently mailed ballots for dozens of elderly or dead voters. Previous Breitbart Texas coverage noted where election integrity experts explained root causes for the latest episode and steps Texas can take to fix the matter going forward: Election integrity advocates have argued that absentee ballot problems can sometimes be rooted in poor maintenance of the underlying voter records. The Public Interest Legal Foundation noted in response to the Dallas episode that Texas should consider tightening procedures for requesting absentee ballots. “As long as you have a name and address of another voter, you’re good to go   …     You don’t even need to give a birth date,” a group spokesperson told Lifezette. Analysts say that requiring absentee ballot applications to include driver’s license or other   identification numbers could cut down impersonation attempts like claimed by the Washington family. Recent fraud conspiracies prosecuted in southern Texas point to a possible example for how elderly voters are preyed upon through the mail voting system. After an unsolicited ballot arrives, an illicit     political operative would visit the recipient’s home, offering “assistance” with completing and returning the form with   candidates in mind. One recent Texas case involved a U. S. Postal Service delivery man taking bribes in trade for allowing “politiqueras” to follow his truck, indicating which homes received ballots. The mailman also allegedly took part in campaigning for local Democrat candidates while in uniform as well. Short of legislative reforms, Mayor Rawlings and Rep. Johnson were left to implore   to “devote additional resources to verify the integrity of each   ballot in Dallas. ” Rawlings Johnson Re Mail Ballots by BreitbartTexas on Scribd,  Logan Churchwell is a founding editor of the Breitbart Texas team.

    "(CNN) As an only child growing up in Japan, photographer Izumi Miyazaki often let her imagination roam free. Armed with her mother’s silver Pentax, the young teen developed a peculiar approach to capturing the world around her. Surreal, grotesque and often humorous, her   seem to turn ”kawaii”    the Japanese descriptor for all things cute    on its head. In one photo, she’s beheaded    her clumpy insides spilling onto a pink backdrop. In another, her signature black bob is obscured by two slices of bread.   Appreciation for Miyazaki’s   style is growing, with thousands following her Tumblr account. And she recently finished her first solo exhibition at the Wild Project Gallery in Luxembourg. Below, the Tokyo’s Musashino Art University graduate discusses her work with CNN Style. RELATED: The world’s most beautiful instagram accounts to follow. .. What was it like growing up in Japan? It’s hard to describe because I don’t have anything to compare it to. But what I believe is that young Japanese people love to be part of a group    or even be classified in a category.  Even when they want to be original and stand out from the crowd, they tend to search for a group of similar people.  Personally, I am a little bit afraid to be cataloged or categorized. That is why I always try to be myself and don’t mind being alone. But perhaps I am in a group as well, without knowing it? Does photography run in the family? Actually, no. My grandfather used to take family pictures, but they weren’t very good. My mom tried too, but she wasn’t much better. When I held the camera for the first time, it felt very natural to me.  How do your photos reflect life and culture in Japan? They probably reflect life in Japan more than I think they do. But that’s not my intention. Although, I really like food    especially Japanese food    so you might see a lot of Japanese snacks in my photos. I don’t think my pictures show my personality. Or at least, if they do, I am not conscious of it. I take   and I am my own model. And yet, I feel that this model is another person. READ: They’re alive! A warped look at Japan’s skylines, How do you usually construct the scenes in your photos? First, I imagine what I want to do. I usually come up with ideas from everyday life. When I read books, watch TV, talk with friends . .. ideas just come up.  For example, I imagined that I wanted to cut my hair with an office paper cutter (Hair Cut, 2016) and I envisioned myself standing on a rice ball (Rice Ball Mountain, 2016). I think about composition carefully too. Does Japanese culture promote or inhibit creativity?   Yes, I think Japanese culture promotes creativity. I think Japanese people yearn for Western things, which unintentionally creates this original culture that I’m really interested in. How does social media influence your work? It’s difficult for me to answer this but thanks to social media, I can see so much variety and many, many things from all over the world. It inspires me to make something. How has your photography evolved over time? I take great care of the choice and balance of colors in each picture. The main evolution is my lighting technique and the use of Photoshop. When I was starting out, I took pictures of what I saw and didn’t make any changes to them. Now I compose the entire   myself and Photoshop has become crucial for my work.  How would you describe your photography style? That’s hard . .. I don’t feel that I have a style. I try to do what I want do, when I want to do it. I don’t really have a guideline or any steps that I like to follow. It is likely that one could classify me into one kind of style or another, but I just try to work in the moment.  Your photos feel quite cinematic. Where do you find your inspiration? Yes, there is some truth in this remark. Since my pictures are set up, this undoubtedly adds a cinematographic dimension. I really love the cinema    I love films like Amélie.  I also look towards American photographer Alex Prager as inspiration because she composes all her images, staging models and creating   scenes. I also like the work of Japanese photo artist Miwa Yanagi, where all the women ironically have the same expression and seem void of personalities.  READ: Youthful and effortlessly cool    Celebrating true Parisian style, What do you hope that viewers take away from your photos? I have no special message or purpose when I take photos. I only hope that visitors approach my photography with an open mind    with as much freedom of thinking as I try to have when I create a picture. Where do you hope to be in the next five years? I hope to have a bigger house, closer to the train station! But more seriously, I don’t know at all. To be honest, I don’t have a clear picture of what I would like to be or what I would like to achieve. I guess we will see.": "56487",
    "A Los Angeles hospital has paid an anonymous hacker $17, 000 to free itself from a cyberattack that had crippled its computer system. The payment, made in bitcoin, an untraceable cryptocurrency, resulted in the hacker handing over the key to remove the “ransomware” planted in the computer system, Allen Stefanek, president and chief executive of Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, said in a letter released Wednesday. The hacker’s devious plan was first noticed on the evening of Feb. 5 when staffers had trouble logging onto their computers, Stefanek said. As a result, staffers could not communicate with each other, although the CEO said patient care wasn’t compromised. While it is unusual for businesses hit by hackers to pay ransoms, Stefanek reasoned it was best to do so in this case. “The malware locks systems by encrypting files and demanding ransom to obtain the decryption key,” the hospital boss wrote in the letter. “The quickest and most efficient way to restore our systems and administrative functions was to pay the ransom and obtain the decryption key. In the best interest of restoring normal operations, we did this. ” Phil Lieberman, a cybersecurity expert, said such attacks on hospitals are rare. “I have never heard of this kind of attack trying to shut down a hospital,” Lieberman told the LA Times. “This puts lives at risk and it is sickening to see such an act. ” HPMC immediately called law enforcement on Feb. 5, Stefanek said. It was not immediately known if the Los Angeles Police Department or the FBI agreed with the hospital in paying the ransom. The FBI has taken the lead in the probe. Ransomware is a specific type of malware downloaded and installed onto a computer system, often during a phishing attack. Once it attaches to a computer, it starts to encrypt crucial system files  —   locking out the rightful owner. The malware then tells the victim he or she needs to pay a ransom before a certain date or all the data will be erased. During the attack, nurses and doctors used pens and paper to take down patient information. The hack appeared to be aimed at getting ransom  —   not stealing patient information. “At this time, we have no evidence that any patient or employee information was the subject of unauthorized access or extraction by the attacker,” Stefanek told the local NBC station. However, patients at the hospital for   CT scans or others procedures that needed computers were transferred to other nearby hospitals, according to one report. There were reports earlier that HPMC has paid a ransom of $3. 4 million, or 9, 000 bitcoins, but Stefanek dubbed those reports false.": "138424",
    "One morning last April, a Delta Airlines passenger jet stormed down a runway at Atlanta’s   International Airport, hitting 138 mph. It was about to leave for Miami when an   controller realized he had given the plane clearance to cross the path of another jet that had just landed. He hurriedly told the pilot to abort takeoff, which jolted the passengers and risked damaging the aircraft. Fortunately, there was plenty of runway left for the plane to stop. What happened that day became one of thousands of incidents captured each year in commercial aviation’s multilayered incident and accident reporting system. The apologetic   controller filed a report to the U. S. Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, which decided it wasn’t a potentially disastrous   and graded it a C, for no danger. Reports like these, which can be matched with technical information on speed and altitude automatically transmitted from aircraft, are submitted under agreements between the FAA, airline operators, service companies, and unions. Many are made anonymously. Like   analysts scrutinizing a constant river of messages, airline and FAA safety experts work to head off disasters by searching for trends in these incident reports. By any index, the system has saved lives and money the most recent commercial aviation fatality occurred in 2009, when a regional jet crashed outside of Buffalo, N. Y. But recently,   safety incidents at U. S. airports have been on the rise: As the Wall Street Journal reported this week, hazardous “runway incursions” jumped 25 percent this fiscal year, increasing for a third year in a row. There are questions about whether the FAA and airlines are learning all they can. Predictive safety depends on faithful reporting of these incidents, which the FAA defines, in essence, as unexpected mishaps: incidents that could affect safe operations and that involve no serious injury or substantial aircraft damage. Yet there’s no clear line between what does and doesn’t meet this definition. Publicly, only abbreviated summaries are posted for most incidents, and others get longer accounts scrubbed of some details. Much of what happens in the skies and on the runways, therefore, stays in the skies and on the runways. The safety of flying depends in part on how much data the aviation industry decides to collect —  and on what mishaps it determines are truly dangerous. * * * Safety experts have known the value of   tracking and   analysis in preventing tragedy since at least 1931, when engineer Herbert William Heinrich theorized in Industrial Accident Prevention: A Scientific Approach that there were 300   for every 29 accidents and every one serious accident or fatality. In Heinrich’s model, the   incidents are the bottom of a pyramid, the accidents are the next level up, and the fatal accidents are at the top. Few now take the ratio literally, but the study of precursor events, aided by the processing power of computers and data mining, has helped to revolutionize safety management. In commercial aviation, separate reporting programs exist for airlines, air controllers, pilots, and technicians. The thousands of confessions, complaints, and other electronic data that roll in each quarter detail faux pas big and small, such as a clipped wing on a taxiway, or an unusually turbulent stretch that shakes up the passengers and crew. The FAA sees anonymity in this reporting as key. “We certainly would not get the transparency and type of data without the anonymity,” says Peggy Gilligan, the organization’s associate administrator of aviation safety. The closest analogy in    life to such anonymous or   data collection would be if every time you accidentally blew through a   or   another driver on the freeway, you filed a report with your insurer without having to worry about your rate going up or policy renewal being turned down. Recently, I spent a few days wading through what is publicly available via the Aviation Safety Reporting System, where anonymous reports are organized by types of calamities. I read about how one crew of a Boeing 757 forgot to lower the wing flaps for a daytime landing because their attention was diverted by the crew of a plane ahead who said there was a coyote at the edge of the runway. In another report, the weary pilots of a regional jet on a   journey landed at an airport without permission. “These kinds of schedules are ridiculous.   …     [I]n hindsight I’m grateful nothing else happened,” a crew member wrote. Another database, the FAA   Data System, which is operated by NASA on behalf of the FAA, has a different look and feel and lacks these unedited crew narratives. You can still spot the   about the Atlanta airport runway incursion involving the two Delta flights, but the database’s advantage is perspective it shows that there were a dozen runway incursions at Atlanta’s   International Airport in 2015, most neither close nor very dangerous. * * * Recently, a team of scholars that wanted to know if the FAA and airlines were learning from all of their recorded incidents turned to the FAA   Data System and yet another database, the National Transportation Safety Board’s aviation accident database. The National Transportation Safety Board investigates incidents and accidents to make safety recommendations to the FAA, and the FAA has become increasingly cooperative in sharing   safety information with the organization. In an article in the journal Risk Analysis, the researchers lauded the FAA and the industry’s accomplishments of recent years. But when they compared prior accident and   data from 64 airlines over a   stretch, from 1990 to 2007, they found that airlines learn mostly from incidents that conjure the memory of a prior accident. And that could lead pilots and controllers and mechanics to slip into a frame of mind where they routinize   and   adjustments, a natural human tendency toward “the normalization of deviance,” the researchers wrote. “It’s the ones that don’t scare you that we want the most attention on,” says Robin L. Dillon —  Merrill, a professor at Georgetown University and one of the paper’s three  . The researchers write in the study: the “prior   where risks were taken without negative consequence, deter any search for new routines” and “often reinforce dangerous behavior. ” The reaction to the journal article from Mark Millam, a vice president at the Flight Safety Foundation, a nonprofit that advocates for aviation safety, was typical of multiple experts I spoke to about this study. He conceded that the paper was “an interesting statistical analysis,” but he also had trouble accepting any of the conclusions, because airlines and the FAA have so much data that isn’t made public. (The FAA did not reply in detail to what is in the study, and pointed to their successes in safety as well as incident reporting.)   and her   relied on the FAA   Data System, so the study was based on FAA definitions of   alone. That includes, for example, bird strikes near airports. The FAA considers bird strikes “valuable safety information” that could affect aircraft design or   control near airports, but they usually don’t trigger engine failure or other damage that could cause a crash or force a dangerous emergency landing. * * *   certainly acknowledges that classifying events as   is a delicate matter. She believes that the best way to define and use   is as an infrequent alarm or warning signal. Set the criteria too low, she warns, and there is the danger that incident will be so common that they are ignored as pesky nuisances. There are other perspectives. One is that the relentless collection of data the past two decades has reached a point of diminishing return. After a while, says Shawn Pruchnicki, a former pilot and faculty member at the Ohio State University Center for Aviation Studies, “everyone assumes more data is better, but more isn’t better. ” Pruchnicki, like others who take what’s called a   approach, believes in nurturing a culture that copes with and manages suddenly hazardous situations. Obsession with data, he says, is part of an obsession with rules, and long prescriptive rules are confining. An aborted takeoff, such as the one in April in Atlanta, may not be the culmination of mistakes, but a symbol of a resilient and flexible system. “It’s all about understanding how the system responds to unfavorable events, how we respond, not the nitty gritty details. ” However carefully   are categorized,   and her   suggest commercial aviation make incident reporting even easier than it is and collect even more reports on even smaller and less obvious incidents. So how far should this go? If a pilot swerves or changes altitude suddenly to avoid a   collision, or needs to hit the brakes and abort a   and in neither instance breeches the required separation between aircraft, and no one is hurt and nothing damaged except the peace of mind of the passengers, does that automatically qualify as an incident? “If something is shaking the passengers up, I believe it should be further investigated,” says   —  even if it’s ultimately not classified as an incident. “Unless the passengers are shaken up by everything,” she adds.": "82031",
    "A hotel in downtown Dubai erupted in flames on Thursday evening, just two hours before the city was due to celebrate New Year’s Eve with a massive fireworks display. At midnight local time, the celebration proceeded as planned  —   resulting in a jarring double display of light and smoke, as firefighters continued to battle the blaze at one skyscraper while fireworks were sent off from the nearby Burj Khalifa. Earlier in the evening, Dubai’s media office confirmed on Twitter that a fire had been reported at the Address Downtown Dubai hotel. The fire began outside the building, on the 20th floor, the media office tweeted, and firefighters worked to prevent it from spreading through the skyscraper’s interior. As of 2 p. m. ET (11 p. m. local time) the media office said firefighters had control of ”90 percent” of the fire. It was not immediately clear what caused the blaze, which the Associated Press reports affected at least 20 stories of the building. Burning debris was falling from the building, the AP noted. The   Address Downtown Dubai building was completed in 2008 and contains 196 luxury hotel rooms and more than 600 apartments, according to its website. By some counts, it’s one of the 100 tallest buildings in the world. It is in the same complex as the Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest skyscraper.

    "During the buildup to the AFC championship game in the Mile High City, the spotlight was fixed on Manning and Brady, the two future Hall of Fame quarterbacks who were meeting for the 17th, and perhaps final time on the gridiron. But it was the Denver defense that stole the show, intercepting Brady twice in the opening half and making two crucial fourth down stops late in the fourth quarter to snuff out potentially game tying scoring drives, including one with just 2:18 on the clock. The Patriots, however, would not quit and with 12 seconds left Brady hit Rob Gronkowski with a   touchdown pass. Needing a   convert to force overtime, the Denver defense again dug in, with Bradley Roby stepping in front of Brady’s pass attempt to preserve the victory and a spot in their   eighth Super Bowl. Manning, who had been plagued by injury and questionable form all season, turned in a performance worthy of a   NFL Most valuable player, tossing a pair of first half touchdowns to Owen Daniels. ”To be going to our second Super Bowl in four years is very special and just an awesome effort by our entire team,” Manning, who will become the oldest quarterback to play in a Super Bowl, told the Denver crowd. ”And what an incredible effort by the Patriots, for us to beat that team today, a very special win.” ”It’s been a special rivalry (with Brady) over the course of our career . .. I just wanted to take the time to share with Tom (Brady) and Bill (Belichick) how much respect I have for them and just what special coaches and players they are.” Added Denver coach Gary Kubiak: ”Defensively we played our tails off all year long and found a way to win another close one.” Denver’s pass rush that led the league in sacks kept Brady under pressure the entire game, forcing the Patriots quarterback to hurry passes and miss targets. Brady completed 27 of 56 pass attempts for 310 yards but was sacked four times, intercepted twice and picked off again on a   attempt as New England’s Super Bowl defense ended. ”For it to come down to a   conversion obviously is a tough way to finish the season,” offered a dejected Brady after the game.  ”You make some, you’re not going to make them all.” ”It was a tough day. Hard fought football game. (The Broncos) put a lot of pressure on you. ”We had some tough plays we just didn’t make them. Just came up one play short.” Denver got the game off to a flying start, as Manning marched the Broncos 83 yards on their opening possession, completing the drive with a   dart to Daniels. Brady, meanwhile, was unable to do much against Denver’s top ranked defense until Jonathan Freeny alertly scooped up a Manning backward pass giving New England the ball on the Broncos 22. Two plays later Steven Jackson powered over from the one. Denver, however, maintained a   lead when Stephen Gostkowski missed his first extra point in 10 years. The Broncos also capitalized on a turnover, Von Miller intercepting Brady at the New England 20 and Manning quickly arching a   touchdown strike to Daniels. The half ended with the Broncos and Patriots hitting on long field goals to send Denver into the break up  . The Patriots began the second half chipping away at the Denver lead with Gostkowski connecting on a   field for the only score of the quarter. Denver’s Brandon McManus answered with a   field goal in the fourth quarter to restore the Broncos’ eight point cushion before Brady mounted a last ditch Patriots rally.  (Editing by Andrew Both.

The witness said he was forced to rape other recruits, and was raped himself by older recruits and staff.   ”The environment made it useless to resist,” he said. ”One could stand only so much abuse before realizing that saying ’no’ was pointless. After a while compliance and getting it over and done with seemed the best solution.”  Many survivors say that when they reported the abuse, they were ignored, punished, or told it was ”a rite of passage” in their initiation period. READ: Report: Military punishes sex assault victims,  Another witness,    Graeme Frazer, told the inquiry that as a    naval recruit in 1967, he remembers being ”terrified” as he was dragged from the showers, beaten and sexually abused by three other recruits.  He said one of the attackers tried to force him to give oral sex, then they held him down while his genitals were covered with boot polish and scrubbed with a hard brush.  ”I still feel a lot of guilt and shame about the abuse,” Frazer said. ”I have suffered depression.”  The inquiry also will hear evidence from former and current staff members, and examine the handling of complaints and the responses to claims for compensation.  The inquiry is part of a   investigation into sexual abuse in the Australian military. A spokesperson for Australia’s Defense Ministry told CNN that it is ”cooperating with the Royal Commission and supports its objectives to safeguard children. We recognize and commend the courage of those who will tell their own stories of personal suffering throughout the hearings. It is not appropriate for (the defense ministry) to comment in further detail on matters that are before the Royal Commission.”": "55368",

    "Step inside any   math class in the United States, and chances are you’ll find students staring down at their Texas Instrument calculators, nimbly typing commands into those $100 pocket computers. Calculators are so commonplace in modern American education that a   or   can be found stashed away in many homes, mementos from taking the SAT or computing integrals on the Advanced Placement calculus exam. Still, college professors remain divided on the use of calculators in their classes. When I took my freshman math courses at McGill University in Montreal last school year, I had to revert back to pencil and paper, clumsily lining up columns to do addition and   problems at my professor’s request. This isn’t an unusual predicament: According to a 2010 national survey by the Mathematical Association of America, nearly half of Calculus 1 college instructors prohibit students from using graphing calculators on exams. The debate over the use of calculators in math classrooms has ensued for more than four decades —  nearly as long as the contemporary calculator has been around. Although the abacus has been in use since the time of the Sumerians and Ancient Egyptians, it wasn’t until 1958 when the Texas Instrument engineer Jack Kilby invented the integrated circuit, which paved the way for the cheap and compact computer chips used in most electronic devices today. (Kilby later won the Nobel Prize in physics.) A decade later, calculators would no longer be stored in gigantic cabinets with a price tag of over $700, 000 they would substantially diminish in size and gradually become more affordable. Today, prices for graphing calculators hover around $80. By the mid 1970s, 11 percent of Americans owned a calculator.   calculators —  those that only perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division —  gradually entered the classrooms, dividing educators and parents alike. Debates over the role of calculators in the classroom quickly emerged, and arguments for and against their use have hardly changed since then. Proponents of the calculator argued that machines could help students make sense of abstract mathematical notations through   problems, making math fun and interesting. Opponents worried that students would become   on calculators, losing the ability to do simple arithmetic operations and exercise a solid sense of numbers. In 1986, Connecticut became the first state to mandate the use of calculators on state tests, signaling the beginning of a   generation. But the most consequential move came three years later from the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) which advocated for the use of calculators from kindergarten through grade 12. The guidelines set by the NCTM were soon adopted into many local and state curricula. In 1994, the College Board made substantial changes to the SAT’s math section to allow the use of calculators. The 1995 Advanced Placement calculus exams were the first to require the use of graphing calculators, a powerful electronic aid that is still used in most   math classes today. For W. Stephen Wilson, a math and education professor at Johns Hopkins University, using a calculator is akin to relying on a crutch when one doesn’t have a bad leg. “I have not yet encountered a mathematics concept that required technology to either teach it or assess it. The concepts and skills we teach are so fundamental that technology is not needed to either elucidate them or enhance them. There might be teachers who can figure out a way to enhance learning with the use of technology, but it’s absolutely unnecessary,” Wilson wrote in the journal Education Studies in Mathematics. Proponents of using technology in classrooms argue that graphing calculators, particularly those equipped with programs that can compute algebraic symbols, would reduce the need for students to memorize formulas and perform   computations. But Wilson fears that students who depend on technology will fail to understand the importance of mathematical algorithms. Yes, a calculator could effortlessly churn out the derivative of( )8, but would students understand how to find the answer using the fundamental theorem of calculus or the definition of the derivative? The idea, Wilson says, is not to have students mindlessly perform mechanical operations, but for students at all levels to apply linear thinking in understanding the beauty of efficient algorithms. If a student can’t master long division, how can she grasp derivatives and integrals? Wilson says he has some evidence for his claims. He gave his Calculus 3 college students a     arithmetic test (can you multiply 5. 78 by 0. 39 without pulling out your smartphone?) and divided the them into two groups: those who scored an eight or above on the test and those who didn’t. By the end of the course, Wilson compared the two groups with their performance on the final exam. Most students who scored in the top 25th percentile on the final also received an eight or above on the arithmetic test. Students at the bottom 25th percentile were twice as likely to score less than eight points on the arithmetic test, demonstrating much weaker computation skills when compared to other quartiles. It’s worth noting that calculators are also more likely to be barred in math exams at research universities than at   colleges and regional public universities. Out of the 50 national universities ranked at the top by U. S. News and World Report, only four schools had policies allowing electronic devices on Calculus 1 exams. One explanation is that selective institutions are less likely to offer remedial math courses and generally accept students who possess a strong math background. Why aren’t high schools taking their cue from math professors at Harvard and MIT? Because most college students won’t major in STEM subjects and won’t need advanced math knowledge for much of their work. Dan Kennedy, a   teacher at Baylor School, argues that to set a reasonable expectation for all students, calculators should be used because many   problems cannot be solved without technology. Students, he says, would be better served by learning probability, statistics, computer literacy, financial mathematics, and matrix algebra —  the kind of math that requires the use of graphing calculators —  not the kind of theoretical math that dominates math competitions. David Bressoud, a math professor at Macalester College in Minnesota, has a different theory: He thinks that large research universities typically ban calculators because the devices are essentially obsolete there. “The larger universities have traditionally had   resources, [and now] it is easier to expect that all students have access to a computer,” Bressoud said. Computers, Bressoud says, are a much better tool for teaching calculus because they are more flexible and faster than calculators. At Macalester,   calculus is known as “Applied Multivariable Calculus 1. ” Computers are heavily encouraged in class, and professors aren’t slowly chalking away proofs and theorems on the blackboard. Unlike those at traditional college math classes, Macalester professors take the word “applied” seriously: A lecture on functions, for example, is demonstrated using the Body Mass Index, a function of height and weight used to determine whether a person is obese. Students in their first year of calculus also learn differential equations, a topic that is generally covered only when students have three semesters’ worth of calculus under their belts. The aim is that, by introducing differential equations early on, students understand how mathematical models are generated. Why? Because these models are used in many fields, including, but not limited to, economics, environmental science, psychology, and medicine. The calculator debate also plays into a larger discussion of whether colleges should be less theoretical and more practical. For technology advocates, an increased emphasis on technology is often seen as a way to prepare students for the real world. Calculator opponents tend to see it differently. The goal of university education, they contend, is for students to get a good grasp of the theoretical foundation of a subject, not to master calculators or computers. After all, today’s technology might become drastically different 20 years from now, but a good foundation will always last. Even Socrates once quipped that a reliance on writing would lead to the deterioration of memory. And many of the best practices in pedagogy teach that memorization does have its merits when it comes to education, despite the invention of the internet and search engines. Drawing the line between the use of and barring of calculators could prove difficult, says Jon Star, an education professor at Harvard University. “That line is also moving as time goes on, at different levels. There might be students who bring different skills who put the line in different places,” Star noted. “I’m very wary of anyone who says it should be at one extreme or the other. ” Many schools opt for the middle way. While calculators might not be allowed on tests and exams, colleges know that   students will utilize programs such as Wolfram Alpha, a powerful   computational tool, to aid with calculus assignments. Homework problems often require calculator use, asking for solutions that involve cumbersome values or algebraic symbols that are too tedious to compute by hand. Will future professors who were born in a generation of smartphones and tablets change the course of this discussion? Only time will tell.": "82430",
    "This past Thursday, we lost a true hero, John Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth. With his death, none of the first Americans to go into space are any longer with us. His bravery  —   as a Marine aviator in World War II and Korea, and as a test pilot in the 1950s, when he attended colleagues’ funerals on an almost weekly basis  —   had been well established before he climbed into the Mercury capsule that sent him into space in 1962. So he was willing to ride on top of an Atlas rocket which, in its   form, had a significant chance of failing. His odds were somewhat better than that, because his rocket had been “man rated,” with   parts, additional redundancy, more thorough inspections, and a   structure. (It also had a   system to pull the capsule rapidly away if something went wrong with the vehicle.) In the end the rocket performed fine, and he suffered no obvious ill effects from the experience, surviving to enter the history books. But it’s worth remembering why he was willing to risk his life on a space flight in the first place. In 1962, at the height of the Cold War, space was important and worthy of such risk. We were going to the moon to demonstrate our technological superiority to the Soviets and the world, and Glenn’s flight was a crucial milestone on that path. SLIDESHOW: Astronaut John Glenn, Two weeks ago, there was a failure of a Russian Soyuz rocket delivering supplies to the International Space Station in a Progress cargo ship. After separation from the lower stages, the third stage of the rocket, needed to provide the final delivery to orbit, didn’t complete its burn  —   it seems in fact to have exploded  —   and the ship fell out of the sky, its pieces scattering in southern Siberia. The loss didn’t create an emergency at the station, which has sufficient supplies to last months  —   more than long enough for another cargo mission to arrive, whether with Soyuz or another entity, such as SpaceX or Orbital ATK. (In fact, a Japanese cargo flight went up a few days ago). But it highlighted a bigger problem: While we have a number of ways to get cargo to the station, since the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011, the Russian Soyuz is our only way of getting crew up and back. And the stage that failed two weeks ago is the same stage used to get the Soyuz crew module into orbit. We don’t yet know why the stage failed. It’s flown successfully many times, so it’s unlikely to be an intrinsic design flaw. It could be due to sloppy procedures, or a faulty component, as a consequence of the general deterioration of the Russian space industry amid corruption and turf wars. While it’s not the first time this stage design has failed, there has been no such failure with crew aboard. Whether it’s because officials take greater precautions with crewed flights or simply because of dumb luck is also not known. But either way, while NASA hasn’t yet made a big deal out of it publicly, until they understand the cause, they can’t trust the rocket to get its astronauts to the ISS, and they won’t be able to rotate crews. Why do we currently have only one means to get to the International Space Station? And why are we unwilling to risk an astronaut’s life on it when it has had a failure? Why is it that, over half a century after John Glenn’s famous flight, our mantra has gone from “Beat the Soviets to the moon” to “Safety is the highest priority,” a phrase used repeatedly in Congressional hearings? In my book a few years ago, I argued that it is because space is no longer important enough to justify the risk of human lives, at least with taxpayer funds. And that when safety is the highest priority, actually accomplishing things in space becomes a lower one by definition. “Safety is the highest priority” is the reason that we don’t have a replacement for the Shuttle, in terms of our ability to get our astronauts into space on American vehicles. NASA has long had a Commercial Crew program to do so, with two providers, SpaceX and Boeing, and it was originally supposed to have been operational by now. But it has been delayed for years, both because of penny pinching by a Congress more eager to fund an unneeded, overpriced rocket and capsule that will rarely fly and because NASA must follow the “safety first” mantra  —   with extensive program reviews, milestones, and inspections  —   to ensure that we don’t lose an astronaut. Which is ironic, considering that NASA has much more insight into the new commercial systems than it’s ever gotten from the Russians on whom it has relied for half a decade. The SpaceX Dragon pressurized capsule was first launched and recovered almost exactly six years before Glenn’s death and the   Soyuz failure, and at the time, company founder Elon Musk said that if someone had been aboard “they’d have had a very nice ride. ”   of safety for the company, NASA astronaut Ken Bowersox, told me that all he’d have needed was a “scuba tank, a regulator, and a beanbag chair. ” But today, the first flight of a crewed Dragon on a SpaceX Falcon 9 has been delayed until   and the first flight of Boeing’s “Starliner” capsule will happen even later than that. Because today, “safety,” not getting Americans into space on American rockets, is “the highest priority. ” If he chooses to, this is one of the things that   Trump can “make great again. ” But it will require a major change in attitude and policy direction, and some of his finalists for NASA administrator provide grave cause for concern. More NASA This Time, Not for Prestige: The Space Race in the 21st Century‘Godspeed, John Glenn’Let Newt Gingrich Fix NASAIn particular, Mike Griffin, who served as administrator under George W. Bush, would be a terrible choice. The last time Dr. Griffin ran NASA, the agency maintained a cozy relationship with the private contractors it employed, a revolving door of the sort that Trump and those in his orbit have lately railed against. Partly as a result, Griffin left his successor a programmatic mess, and while it would be ironic if he became administrator again and   that same mess, the best way for Trump to honor the memory of John Glenn (who late in his life saw private spaceflight as the future) would be to pick a fresh face, with a fresh approach not tainted by the failed ideology of Apolloism. NASA needs a leader who is willing to tell Congress that our space future lies not with giant rockets, but with commercially affordable ones, and that when it comes to spaceflight, safe is not an option. A leader who understands that the acceptance of risk is necessary to show that American spaceflight matters, as it used to. A leader, that is, with the courage and vision of Glenn himself.,": "122089",

    "One of the four surviving warriors who defended more than 30 American personnel at two U. S. facilities in Benghazi tells Breitbart News he supports Donald J. Trump for president because: “He gets it. ”[“You got a businessman, who knows how to run things, knows how to get things done —  he’s going to have the aggressiveness America needs to have,” said John “Tig” Tiegen, a Marine veteran. Along with Mark “Oz” Geist, a Marine veteran Kris “Tanto” Paronto, an Army Ranger veteran and Dave “Boon” Benton, a Marine veteran and trained sniper, Tiegen contributed to the book 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi.  The book chronicles their fight to beat back repeated attacks along with former Navy SEALs Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, who were killed along with Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and State Department IT specialist Sean Smith on Sept. 11, 2012. Another former Navy SEAL fighting with them is given the cover name of Jack DaSilva. Tiegen said he endorsed Trump for president and was thrilled to have a Monday night slot addressing the Republican National Convention. The Marine said he and his comrades have met Trump and came away impressed by his sincere interest in their story and its lessons for American leaders. “We got to ask him questions and to see if he would give us the political answer or the straight up answer,” he said. “You know? He gave us the straight up answer. Didn’t try to   anything or answer our question with a question. ” Although he and Geist are stepping up to help Trump win the White House, he said the book and their story was not meant to be political, it was meant to be a testimony to the bravery of the four men killed that night. “We just wanted to make sure the four guys were being honored correctly,” he said. “To bring politics into the story of that night would be a dishonor to them. We weren’t fighting for our political parties, you know? We were fighting for each other —  to get out of there alive. ” The Marine said there is still a question about why the Pentagon did not send help that night. It could be something about former President Bill Clinton and his wife,   of State Hillary Clinton, Tiegen said. As president, Clinton abandoned the Army Rangers fighting in Mogadishu and the secretary of state abandoned the 30 personnel  in Benghazi, he said. “You don’t have to be in uniform, to me, the average American always thinks: ‘Hey, if Americans are in trouble, the troops are going to come for you.’ It seems like under the Clintons, they don’t do that. ” When the House Select Committee on Benghazi came out with its final report, Tiegen said he stopped reading it when he got to the part about how the Air Force was unable to send fighter jets because their planes were all broken down for a parts inventory. “Every one in the military knows they are lying when they say a whole entire Air Force base overseas was shut down all the planes were down for maintenance or for training,” he said. “For me that was the red flag, I knew I didn’t have to read their report no more, because I knew they were lying —  that never happens. It doesn’t happen in the U. S. so you know it doesn’t happen overseas on   —  they’re covering somebody’s behind —  maybe they were offered a job with the Clinton Foundation? I don’t know. ” There were military units and assets available to help, such as the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, he said. “The 24th MEU, they were about four hours away from Benghazi. An MEU is a battalion of Marines. They have aircraft that could get there. They have jets that can get there. ” USS Jason Dunham, an   destroyer, was six miles off the coast, he said. “If that ship is there, then there have to be other ships close by, too. ” Privately, people have reached out to Tiegen and his comrades from the Benghazi raid with stories from the inside, such as inside U. S. Africa Command, about what really happened, he said. “We had guys contact us, who were in AfriCom, and they said: ‘Yes, the State Department told us to stand down. ’” Tiegen said, “If I was getting ready to join the military right now, I wouldn’t do it. I’d wait to see who is getting elected —  if it is another Clinton, you don’t know if they have your back if something happens. They will just leave you to hang out to dry. ” With a Clinton in charge, it is hard to make military decisions, he said. “Either a bunch of your guys get blown up or shoot a guy on a motorcycle —  it’s happening all the time over there  —  they don’t know who they can shoot, so that everybody comes home —  because if they shoot the wrong guy, they go to prison. ” Similarly, President Barack Obama has stymied military   and execution because of his emphasis on political loyalty, he said. Generals and admirals who spoke up against the president were fired and relieved, creating a collection of flag officers who place career advancement before duty, he said. “It is really disheartening to know that the generals care more about the politics than what is actually is going on,” he said. “Now, you got all these pansies up in the Joint Chiefs of Staff,” he said. “They have no cojones. They’re going to leave 30 Americans out to die because they have a brunch they have to go to —  like I keep saying: ‘If Pearl Harbor’ was held today, we’d be screwed. We’d all be speaking Japanese. ’”": "50290",
    "It is a mark of the diet industry’s brazen resilience that, in response to growing public awareness of how, for decades, it colluded with the sugar lobby to dump the blame for obesity on fat, it is scrambling to tell a new story. If you are doing dry January or Veganuary you are hopelessly behind this year, it’s all about   January, from the very people who brought you “fat will kill you   …     no, actually, it’s bread!” Well, someone has to monetise these  .

Birthing a baby is hard. Losing a parent is hard. Drinking your coffee black. Is. Not. Hard. ” This reminds me of those actors who say acting’s not coal mining, or risking one’s life in a war, then bat their eyelashes at how hard it is to be popular. Endless studies detail how hard it is to break dietary habits, particularly when people are too busy or poor or harried to think five meals ahead and plan around a ban on every food item in the house.

    "The EPA on Tuesday named its first 10 hazardous chemicals  —   most notably asbestos  —   to a new roster of workplace or home health hazards that may result in some of the chemicals being banned. Largely composed of industrial solvents, flame retardants, and workplace cleaners, the announcement of the new list kicks off a   overhaul of how the environmental agency regulates dangerous chemicals. “We now have the power to require safety reviews of all chemicals in the marketplace,” EPA official Jim Jones said in a statement. A June law had required the first 10 chemicals to be named by Dec. 19. Asbestos, a   material that causes mesothelioma cancer, was widely expected to be on the list. Naming the chemicals to the list begins a   review that might lead to their ban. According to the American Chemistry Council, “a chemical’s inclusion in this first group of ten chemicals does not in and of itself indicate anything about the safety of the chemical. ” The industry group said they expected the EPA to conduct detailed risk evaluations before making any decisions on the use of the chemicals. “In order to help ensure the most credible results, it is imperative that EPA engage stakeholders early and often throughout the risk evaluation process, including through peer review and public comment,” the ACC said in a statement. The 10 chemicals on the list are: Asbestos, Carbon Tetrachloride, Cyclic Aliphatic Bromide Cluster, Methylene Chloride,   Pigment Violet 29, Tetrachloroethylene (also known as PERC or dry cleaning fluid)    and  . “While this is an important milestone, this list is just the first 10 of 1, 000 chemicals in need of urgent EPA review,” Scott Faber of the Environmental Working Group said in a statement. He noted the June law also doesn’t cover cosmetics and similar consumer chemicals. One disappointment for environmental groups was the new list did not include lead, known to be a health hazard for decades. Lead was most recently the cause of a public health disaster in Flint, Michigan, where water pipe corrosion led to its widespread diffusion in drinking water. “It is tragic that while children continue to be exposed to ongoing, unnecessary uses of lead in consumer products, EPA is not even starting the process of phasing out these uses with its new authority to regulate toxic substances,” attorney Eve Gartner of the environmental group, Earthjustice told BuzzFeed News by email.": "113411",
    "For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.             Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, In recent months, a proliferation of ransomware attacks has affected everyone from   and   owners to hospitals and police departments. An attack works like this: A virus arrives and encrypts a company’s data then a message appears demanding a fee of hundreds or thousands of dollars. If the ransom is paid in time, the information is restored. “At the heart of this new business model for cybercrime is the fact that individuals and businesses, not retailers and banks, are the ones footing the bill for data breaches,” Josephine Wolff noted in The Atlantic back in June. According to an FBI tally, ransomware attacks cost their victims a total of $209 million in the first three months of 2016, a stunning surge upward from $24 million in all of 2015. However, that figure was based only on the complaints that victims reported to the bureau. In a new report, Datto, a   cybersecurity company, offers an alarmingly higher estimate that accounts for unreported incidents and lost productivity, which costs businesses far more than paying ransoms does. The company’s survey of 1, 100 IT professionals found that nearly 92 percent had clients that suffered ransomware attacks in the last year, including 40 percent whose clients had sustained at least six attacks. The report found that “less than 1 in 4 ransomware incidents are reported to the authorities. ” Factoring in the cost and average amount of time lost to infections —  an overwhelming majority of small businesses hit by ransomware face at least two days of downtime —  as well as the number of businesses affected by them, Datto suggests that the financial impact of this brand of cybercrime starts in the range of $75 billion each year. The company arrived at this figure based on an estimate from the Aberdeen Group, a consultancy, that an hour of inactivity costs small companies an average of $8, 581 per hour. By comparison, Datto’s survey indicated that about   of the IT professionals said the ransoms paid were somewhere between $100 and $2, 000. Overall, Datto estimates that $375 million has been paid out in ransoms in the past year, making lost productivity the much bigger concern. Joe Gleinser, the president of GCS Technologies, an   IT support and services company, walked me through just how   it is for companies to deal with ransomware attacks, which generally starts with the appearance of “unusually named files” or files that suddenly can’t be accessed. “Locking the network down” —  freezing some or all of a company’s systems —  is typically the first step after the attack is recognized, in an effort to stop the damage and look for fixes. “So that’s productivity hit number one,” he said. For a small business, that can mean an entire operation for a larger one, it could mean a section or a division. “Obviously in certain industries that’s a lot more painful,” Gleinser added. “In health care, that can mean patients going untreated. If you don’t have that information, you don’t know what drugs were prescribed and sometimes it’s tough to make decisions. ” Earlier this year, operations at a Los Angeles hospital came to a near halt, leaving staff to use faxes and paper notes to communicate before a $17, 000 ransom was paid. If a business has a     system in place, data may be restored with only some small delays and limited expense. Should a sufficient   not be possible and should the inaccessible files be deemed important enough, the second step is paying the ransom, a practice that the FBI discourages, but says is not illegal under most circumstances. “Paying the ransom is tricky business,” said Gleinser. “You’re dealing with criminals. ” While many ransomers operate quickly, even attentively, that is not always the case. Datto’s survey found that 7 percent of IT professionals reported incidents where data was not restored even after a ransom was paid. But even paying the ransom can be tricky. “If you don’t have Bitcoin right now, you’re probably not going to get it before the timer expires on the infection,” Gleinser said. “Many of these infections, as soon as you start the process to engage with the ransomer   …     you have about 48 hours before the data is   to encourage you to move quickly. ” As one cybersecurity company executive told Business Insider last month, banks have started to keep tens of thousands of dollars in Bitcoin ready in case of an attack. “Buying bitcoin on any one of the U. S. exchanges is a    day wait time, so we’ve been forced into the position of having to stock bitcoin as if it were computer equipment and have it ready for our use,” Gleinser added. And even if a company is prepared to pay, when the deadline arrives, the price can jump, sometime double, triple, or even quadruple, or the data can be rendered permanently unrecoverable. “We’ve seen some clients who had paid the ransom and then immediately get attacked again,” he added. So who is doing this? Ransomware attacks originate largely in Russian or Eastern European outfits, but in recent years, they’ve come from all over the world. Quoting FBI statistics, Gleinser says an average of 4, 000 ransomware episodes now take place each day, mostly with no ideological rhyme or reason. These   attacks have changed a basic business calculus whereby employers and management have started looking outward for threats instead of inward. “We’ve told clients the last 15 years, the number one threat is not the boogeyman, it’s   …     the third party you’ve already given access to your network. Disgruntled staff has by far been the largest security risk our clients have dealt with historically,” Gleinser said. “It’s not definitely true in this day and age. There definitely is a boogeyman out to get these guys. ” With Bitcoin enabling easier and less traceable methods of cybercrime, ransomware attacks will almost certainly not be the boogeyman’s final evolution. \tA bartender’s camera captures the seedy street life of retro New York.": "80137",
    "The Trump administration announced plans to keep voter roll data it has requested from all 50 states and the District on White House computers under the direction of a member of Vice President Pence’s staff, it told a federal judge Thursday. The disclosure of the White House role came in a government filing required in a lawsuit by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a watchdog organization that has asked a federal judge in Washington to block the requests for voter data until the impact on Americans’ privacy can be fully assessed. A decision on the request for a temporary restraining order by U. S. District Judge Colleen   is expected as early as Friday afternoon. The commission’s request for voting information has caused a nationwide uproar. The states that won’t provide all of their voter data grew to a group of at least 44 by Wednesday, including some that said they would provide nothing. Others said that they will provide what information they can but that state laws control what can be made public.    Then U. S.   Donald Trump met with Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach in November 2016. (Mike  )  The vice president’s office said the commission’s letter asked only for publicly available data under state laws, stating that 20 states have agreed to share at least some data and 16 more are reviewing the request. President Trump has made claims widespread voter fraud cost him the popular vote in November, although critics say the claim is unsubstantiated and is a pretext for voter suppression.  [Why almost every state is partially or fully rebuffing Trump’s election commission]  In a court filing, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) vice chairman of the Trump panel and a leading conservative voice on concerns about voter fraud, said the data would be stored through the White House. The executive order in May creating the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity stated that the panel would be funded and staffed through the General Services Administration  —   a federal agency subject to privacy requirements. But that arrangement has shifted, according to Kobach’s filing. “At this time, there are no plans for the General Services Administration to collect or store any voter registration or other   data for the Commission,” Kobach said in response to questions from the court. “Commission staff will download the files   …     onto White House computers,” he wrote, adding that an employee of the vice president’s office will be responsible with White House information technology staff for collecting and storing any data.   a 1997 Clinton appointee, had pressed for details about committee membership and operations after the government asked her to toss out the EPIC lawsuit. The government defended its request for voter details saying the data was “publicly available” and that the commission planned to “ ” sensitive data before releasing documents. It also said the voter commission was a presidential advisory panel not subject to federal privacy review requirements. In its response, EPIC President Marc Rotenberg called the privacy implications of the demand for voter roll data from across the country “staggering,” and said the commission had no authority “to gather hundreds of millions of voter records from the states or to create a secret database stored in the White House. ” EPIC wrote to the court that the commissionsought data “at the heart of democratic institutions and protected under state law   …     without complying with any of the laws enacted to protect personal privacy. ” The privacy watchdog said the panel’s June 28 request to collect, store and publish personal voter information covered at least 157 million registered voters, or more than the 149 million individual tax returns received by the Internal Revenue Service. EPIC said the proposal would increase privacy risks to every registered voter, “including in particular military families whose home addresses would be revealed. ” In its letters to state officials, the commission invited them to submit state data by email, or by an   file exchange website, with an invalid security certification system, neither of which appear secured, EPIC said. It also highlighted the commission’s request for partial Social Security Numbers  —   often used as passwords for commercial services  —   and felony conviction data included in voter data, and said plans to make such information publicly available “is both without precedent and crazy. ” Trump formed the commission after repeatedly suggesting that voter fraud cost him the popular vote against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Studies and state officials of both parties have found no evidence of widespread voting fraud.  [Trump challenges states on voter fraud: ‘What are they trying to hide? ’]  Led by chairman Pence, Kobach on Thursday confirmed in a court filing that the panel’s other members are Indiana Secretary of State Connie Lawson (R); New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner (D); Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap (D); former Ohio secretary of state Ken Blackwell (R); Christy McCormick (R) commissioner with the U. S. Election Assistance Commission; former Arkansas state representative David Dunn (D); Mark Rhodes, clerk of Wood County, W. Va. (D); and Hans von Spakovsky, senior legal fellow of the Heritage Foundation (R).  [Trump’s   commission wants to know voting history, party ID and address of every voter in the U. S.]  Kobach said in the court filing that McCormick is not serving in her official capacity as a member of the EAC. Kobach said the Trump commission has “no legal relationship with the EAC,” and that while the president can appoint additional members to the newly formed advisory commission, to Kobach’s knowledge, no other federal agency officials are currently under consideration.

    "An offshoot of the militant Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) claimed responsibility on Sunday for twin bombings that killed 38 people and wounded 155 outside an Istanbul soccer stadium, an attack for which the Turkish government vowed vengeance.  The Kurdistan Freedom Hawks (TAK) which has claimed several other deadly attacks in Turkey this year, said in a statement on its website that it was behind Saturday night’s blasts, which shook a nation still trying to recover from a failed military coup and a number of bombings this year..  Saturday’s attacks took place near the Vodafone Arena, home to Istanbul’s Besiktas soccer team, about two hours after a match at the stadium and appeared to target police officers. The first was a car bomb outside the stadium, followed within a minute by a suicide bomb attack in an adjacent park. TAK, which has claimed responsibility for an Ankara bombing that killed 37, is an offshoot of the PKK, which has carried out a violent,   insurgency, mainly in Turkey’s largely Kurdish southeast.  ”What we must focus on is this terror burden. Our people should have no doubt we will continue our battle against terror until the end,” Turkey President Tayyip Erdogan told reporters after meeting injured victims in an Istanbul hospital. ’WE WILL HAVE VENGEANCE’ Speaking at a funeral for five of the police officers at the Istanbul police headquarters, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said: ”Sooner or later we will have our vengeance. This blood will not be left on the ground, no matter what the price, what the cost.” Soylu also warned those who would offer support to the attackers on social media or elsewhere; comments aimed at   politicians the government accuses of having links to the PKK, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, Europe and Turkey. In recent months thousands of Kurdish politicians have been detained, including dozens of mayors and the leaders of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) parliament’s   opposition party, accused of having links to the PKK. The crackdown against Kurdish politicians has coincided with widespread purges of state institutions after July’s failed coup, which the government blames on followers of a U. S.  Muslim cleric.  Turkey says the measures are necessary to defend its security, while rights groups and some Western allies accuse it of skirting the rule of law and trampling on freedoms. In a statement, the   HDP condemned the attack and urged the government to end what it called the language and politics of ”polarization, hostility and conflict”. Soylu said that the first explosion was at an assembly point for riot police. The second came as police surrounded the suicide bomber in the nearby Macka park.   people died, including 30 police and seven civilians, he said. One person remained unidentified. Thirteen people have been detained in connection with the attacks, Soylu said. A total of 155 people were being treated in hospital, with 14 of them in intensive care and five in surgery, Health Minister Recep Akdag told a news conference.     Flags flew at   and Sunday was declared a day of national mourning.  Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said that Turkey’s allies should show solidarity with it in the fight against terrorism, a reference to disagreements with the United States over the fellow NATO member’s policy on Syria. Washington backs the Syrian Kurdish YPG in the fight against Islamic State. Turkey, meanwhile, says the militia is an extension of the PKK and a terrorist group. In addition to the Kurdish insurgency, Turkey is battling Islamic State as a member of the United   coalition against the jihadist group. Less than a week ago Islamic State urged its supporters to target Turkey’s ”security, military, economic and media establishment”. ’MY SON WAS MASSACRED’ Video purporting to show the father of one of the victims, a    medical student in Istanbul for a weekend visit, went viral on social media in Turkey. ”I don’t want my son to be a martyr, my son was massacred,” the footage showed the father saying. ”His goal was to be a doctor and help people like this, but now I am carrying him back in a funeral car.” Security remained tight in Istanbul, with police helicopters buzzing overhead in the Besiktas district near the stadium. NATO   Jens Stoltenberg condemned what he described as ”horrific acts of terror” while European leaders also sent messages of solidarity. German Chancellor Angela Merkel called Erdogan to convey her condolences, sources in his office said. The United States condemned the attack and said it stood with its NATO ally.

    "The Arab world’s biggest powers cut ties with Qatar on Monday, accusing it of support for Islamist militants and Iran, and reopening a festering wound two weeks after U. S. President Donald Trump’s demand for Muslim states to fight terrorism. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain severed diplomatic relations with Qatar in a coordinated move. Yemen, Libya’s   government and the Maldives joined later. Transport links shut down, triggering supply shortages. Qatar, a small peninsular nation of 2. 5 million people that has a large U. S. military base, denounced the action as predicated on lies about it supporting militants. It has often been accused of being a funding source for Islamists, as has Saudi Arabia. Iran, long at odds with Saudi Arabia and a    target of the move, blamed Trump’s visit last month to Riyadh and called for the sides to overcome their differences. ”What is happening is the preliminary result of the sword dance,” tweeted Hamid Aboutalebi, deputy chief of staff to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, referring to Trump’s joining in a traditional dance with the Saudi king at the meeting. Closing all transport links with Qatar, the three Gulf states gave Qatari visitors and residents two weeks to leave, and Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt banned Qatari planes from  landing and forbade them from crossing their air space. Qatar’s stock market index sank 7. 3 percent, with some of the market’s top blue chips hardest hit, and some Egyptian banks said they were suspending dealing with Qatari banks. The UAE and Saudi Arabia stopped exports of white sugar to Qatar, a potential hit to consumers during the holy month of Ramadan, when demand is high. Some residents in Qatar began stockpiling food and supplies, an expatriate said. ”People have stormed into the supermarket hoarding food, especially imported ones. . .. It’s chaos   I’ve never seen anything like this before,” said Eva Tobaji, an expatriate resident in Doha, told Reuters after returning from shopping. Supply difficulties quickly developed. Two Middle East trade sources spoke of thousands of trucks carrying food stuck at the Saudi border, unable make the sole overland frontier crossing into Qatar. About 80 percent of Qatar’s food requirements are sourced via bigger Gulf Arab neighbors. Trade sources pointed to the likelihood of shortages growing in Qatar until the crisis eased.  Along with Egypt, however, the UAE and Saudi Arabia could be vulnerable to retaliation, being highly dependent on Qatar for liquefied natural gas. ’WORRISOME’ The hawkish tone on Tehran and on terrorism that Trump brought in his visit to Muslim leaders in Riyadh is seen as having laid the groundwork for the diplomatic crisis. ”You have a shift in the balance of power in the Gulf now because of the new presidency: Trump is strongly opposed to political Islam and Iran,” said   Rickli, head of global risk and resilience at the Geneva Centre for Security Policy. ”He is totally aligned with Abu Dhabi and Riyadh, who also want no compromise with either Iran or the political Islam promoted by the Muslim Brotherhood.” The United States called for a quick resolution of the dispute, and does not want to see a ”permanent rift,” a senior U. S. administration official said. ”There’s an acknowledgement that a lot of Qatari behavior is quite worrisome not just to our Gulf neighbors but to the U. S.,” the official said. ”We want to bring them in the right direction.” A State Department official said all U. S. partnerships with Gulf nations were vital and called on all parties to quickly resolve their differences. The U. S. military said it had seen no impact to its   operations, intended mainly as a bulwark against Iran, and added it was grateful for Qatar’s   support of a U. S. presence and commitment to regional security. The diplomatic   threatens the international prestige of Qatar, which is set to host the 2022 soccer World Cup. Soccer’s governing body, FIFA, said on Monday it was in ”regular contact” with Qatar’s 2022 organizing committee, but did not comment directly on the diplomatic situation.  MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD Qatar’s backing of Islamists dates to a decision by the current emir’s father to end a tradition of automatic deference to Saudi Arabia, the dominant Gulf Arab power, and forge the widest possible array of allies. Doha subsequently cultivated not only Islamists like America’s foes Iran, Hamas and the Taliban in pursuit of leverage, but also Washington itself, hosting the largest U. S. air base in the Middle East. Qatar has for years presented itself as a mediator and power broker for the region’s many disputes. But Egypt and the Gulf Arab states resent Qatar’s support for Islamists, especially the Muslim Brotherhood, which they see as a political enemy. Muslim Brotherhood groups allied to Doha are now mostly on retreat in the region, especially after a 2013 military takeover in Egypt ousted the elected Islamist president. The former army chief and now president, Abdel Fattah   along with Cairo’s allies in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, blacklist the Brotherhood as a terrorist organization. The Brotherhood says it supports only peaceful politics. Saudi Arabia accused Qatar on Monday of backing militant groups and broadcasting their ideology, an apparent reference to Qatar’s influential   satellite channel al Jazeera. Later in the day, the kingdom shut the Saudi bureau of al Jazeera. Al Jazeera says it is an independent news service giving a voice to everyone in the region. Riyadh also accused Qatar of supporting what it described as   militants in the restive, largely Shi’ite   eastern Saudi region of Qatif, as well as in Bahrain. Qatar denied it was interfering in the affairs of others. ”The campaign of incitement is based on lies that had reached the level of complete fabrications,” the Qatari foreign ministry said in a statement. Turkey also called for dialogue to settle the dispute and a government spokesman said President Tayyip Erdogan was working for a diplomatic solution to the rift. Sudan expressed its concern over the row and offered to mediate between all sides. FALLOUT A split between Doha and its closest allies could have  repercussions around the Middle East, where Gulf states have used their financial and political power to influence events in Libya, Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Yemen. The economic fallout was already hitting home as Abu Dhabi’s   Etihad Airways, Dubai’s Emirates Airline and budget carriers Flydubai and Air Arabia said they would suspend all flights to and from Doha indefinitely from Tuesday morning. Qatar Airways said on its official website it had suspended all flights to Saudi Arabia. Many Gulf airports, including in Qatar, are major hubs for international connecting flights. The measures are more severe than during a previous   rift in 2014, when Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE withdrew their ambassadors from Doha, again alleging Qatari support for militant groups. At that time, travel links were maintained and Qataris were not expelled. Neighboring Kuwait has been mediating in the dispute, and its emir, Sheikh Sabah       urged Qatar’s ruler to calm tensions and refrain from escalating the rift, Kuwait state news agency Kuna said.   called on Qatar’s Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa   to give efforts at mediation a chance to contain differences, a few hours after Khalid   an adviser to the Saudi king, visited Kuwait.

    "Donald J. Trump faced a backlash on Thursday from some of his top conservative Hispanic supporters, who said their hopes that he was softening his immigration policy had been dashed by his fiery speech Wednesday night, which they said was  . Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, had shown signs in recent weeks that he was prepared to take a more conciliatory approach to immigrants who had entered the country illegally, dropping talk of a deportation force and instead speaking of treating those immigrants in a fair and humane fashion. Less than two weeks ago, he held a meeting with his Hispanic advisory council in Trump Tower, leaving attendees with the impression that he was working on a new plan that included a path to citizenship. That impression faded in Phoenix on Wednesday night. “There was so much hope,” said Jacob Monty, a member of the Hispanic advisory council who was at the meeting with Mr. Trump. “He used us as props. ” Mr. Monty, a longtime Republican, said that Mr. Trump had appeared humble during the meeting, listened to their proposals, acknowledged the difficulty of deporting 11 million unauthorized immigrants and suggested that he was working on a new policy that included a path to legalization. Mr. Monty resigned from the council after Mr. Trump’s speech. “That was not a Republican speech, that was populist propaganda,” Mr. Monty said. “He must listen to whoever speaks to him last. ” Ramiro Pena, a pastor from Texas who was on Mr. Trump’s advisory council, also abandoned the campaign. According to an email to the Trump campaign, obtained by Politico, Mr. Pena, who could not be reached for comment, said the group that Mr. Trump had formed was a “scam. ” Other conservative Hispanic leaders were also disappointed. Alfonso Aguilar, director of the American Principles Project’s Latino Partnership, who backed Mr. Trump and offered advice on immigration policy to his campaign, withdrew his support on Thursday morning. Mr. Aguilar said that he and other conservative Hispanic leaders had gotten behind Mr. Trump because they thought he would be able to work with Congress to get something done on immigration reform. “A couple of weeks ago, it sounded as if there was going to be a pivot,” said Mr. Aguilar, who predicted that other Republican Latinos would soon renounce their support for Mr. Trump. “If you heard the speech last night, it was either   or be deported. ” Some advisers who expressed concern said they still planned to stick with Mr. Trump, hopeful that their input might make a difference in the future. Alberto Delgado, a Florida pastor who was at the meeting with Mr. Trump, was aware of his plans to build a wall and remove criminals who are in the country illegally. But he was disappointed to hear that all unauthorized immigrants would have to leave the country and go through an application process to return. “That gets me a little bit,” said Mr. Delgado, who had been expecting to hear about a quick administrative fix that would keep families together. “If you apply, you don’t always get what you apply for. ” Still, Mr. Delgado said that he was not ready to quit the advisory group. Mr. Trump has been trying to improve his Hispanic outreach efforts as he continues to lag behind Hillary Clinton in most national and state polls. Recently, he adjusted his pitch to minority voters to argue that his plans to restore law and order would be in their best interests and that Democrats were taking them for granted. The Trump campaign shrugged off dissension among conservative Hispanics on Thursday. “Mr. Trump has been consistent in advocating for an end to illegal immigration, and he will continue to reach out and work with voters from all communities to defeat crooked Hillary Clinton this fall,” said Jason Miller, a spokesman for the campaign. Mr. Trump continued to talk tough on immigration on Thursday at a midday rally in Wilmington, Ohio. “Last night I outlined a bold new immigration reform to create prosperity and opportunity for all of our people, especially those who have the least,” he told the crowd. “We will treat everyone with dignity, respect and compassion, but our greatest compassion will be for the American citizen. ” Some of Mr. Trump’s most ardent conservative backers, such as the commentators Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter, had expressed concern last week that Mr. Trump was preparing to reverse himself on immigration. Ms. Coulter’s fears were assuaged by the speech, which she called “the most magnificent” ever given. Mr. Trump, for his part, continued to spar with President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico over who would pay for a border wall, vowing on Twitter that Mexico would bear the cost. Mr. Peña Nieto fired back in a Twitter post of his own to say that, as they had discussed in person, his country would do no such thing. For Hispanic leaders who have been critical of Mr. Trump, his speech in Arizona was more evidence that he has not changed and most likely will not. Javier Palomarez, president of the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said that Mr. Trump had proven to be a “clown” and that it was a sad moment for the Republican Party. “I think he’s done for with the Hispanic community,” Mr. Palomarez told MSNBC on Thursday. “He’s never going to see the White House if he doesn’t get a significant portion of the Hispanic vote. ” Democrats sought to press their advantage with Hispanics on Thursday, describing Mr. Trump’s remarks as offensive and racist. “This was a dark and disturbing speech,” Senator Tim Kaine, Mrs. Clinton’s running mate, said on CBS. “This is the kind of   language that’s always had a tiny fringe support in this country, but it was a speech that’s not worthy of a president. ”": "25229",
    "Philip K. Howard is chair of the group Common Good and author of “The Rule of Nobody. ”             On Fox News on Sunday,   Donald Trump lamented that those seeking government permits sometimes “are waiting in line for 15 years,” sometimes only to get rejected in the end, and vowed to speed up the process. To succeed, he’ll need a new approach to governing. Every president since Jimmy Carter has vowed to cut unnecessary regulations, but the   machine has defied all attempts at control.  Trump’s idea is to institute a “   ” rule  —   that for every new regulation, two must be removed. Britain instituted a similar protocol in 2010 to cull unnecessary regulation and recently expanded it to “one in, three out. ” This is part of a broader British effort to control regulatory creep, and it has achieved modest success. Imposing similar discipline on new U. S. regulations is long overdue. For the past 50 years, Washington’s approach has been like the Roach Motel  —   regulations check in, but they never check out. But incremental reform is not enough.    reformers have failed because they assume the problem is a matter of degree  —   that there are just too many rules. Liberals stride into the   jungle with pruning shears, and find themselves entangled in the internal logic of the rules. Conservatives get cheers for demanding deregulation, but when push comes to shove, voters don’t want to drink polluted water, eat spoiled food or entrust loved ones to the unsupervised care of strangers in   centers and nursing homes. That’s why the regulatory state grew, not shrank, in the 20 years of Reagan and two Bush presidencies.  What reformers have missed is that regulatory failure is not merely a matter of too much regulation but is caused by a flawed philosophy on how to regulate. Both sides assume that human responsibility should be replaced by what is called “clear law. ” By striving to prescribe every possible good choice, and proscribe every possible evil, U. S. regulation became an obsessive exercise in micromanagement. That’s why rulebooks are often 1, 000 pages, while the Constitution is 15. The evil to be exorcised by all these legal dictates is human authority. Only by lashing each other tightly with detailed law can liberal and conservative politicians be sure that the other side won’t do something bad. But ordinary citizens in our free society are also lashed to these mindless dictates  —   complying with rules that often make no difference, filling out forms no one reads and stymied by bureaucrats whose response to every idiocy is always “The rule made me do it. ” In the name of better freedom, detailed regulations have made everyone powerless. The solution  —   the only solution  —   is to retool regulation to focus on results, not inputs. Find any good school, any good agency, and you will find people who take responsibility for getting the job done. Experts at the Federal Aviation Administration certify planes as “airworthy” based on their expert judgment, not compliance with detailed specs on, say, how many rivets per square foot. Teachers at good schools typically say that the principal encourages them to do what they think is best and not worry about complying with many forms and metrics. The activating mechanism for every public choice must be human responsibility. What’s good is what works. Yes, it’s a good idea to review environmental impacts, but it’s idiotic to spend a decade creating   tomes that double the cost of projects and cause environmental harm by prolonging polluting bottlenecks.  The opportunity here is to move from paralysis to practicality. Focusing on results, with clear lines of authority and accountability, is a   strategy: Regulation is more effective, and less costly, when regulators and citizens are not preoccupied with compliance. Australia replaced dense nursing home regulation with 31 general principles  —   for example, to provide “a   setting. ” Within a short period, nursing homes across Australia markedly improved because, studies showed, the caregivers felt free to focus on what residents needed instead of trudging through the day with their noses in a rulebook.  Regulation by results would radically simplify law  —   in some areas, more like “   . ” Hundreds of federal safety specifications for factory equipment could be encompassed within one general principle: “Tools and equipment shall be reasonably suited for the use intended, in accordance with industry standards. ” Is there room for disagreement? Yes, but only at the margins. Instead of wasting regulatory resources on foot faults that don’t matter, the safety agency could redeploy its resources to finding workplaces that are actually unsafe. Specificity would still be needed for, say, pollution discharge limits, but the litmus test should be whatever achieves the desired results. Rebuilding the federal behemoth is an ambitious goal, fraught with perceived peril as well as opportunity. But do we have a choice? No one serious defends the inefficiencies in the current system. Americans are tired of being pushed around by headless bureaucracy.   by the past six presidents have all failed. The upside here is transformational. Virtually every federal program is broken, with the only open question how much. Should   compliance costs drive small banks into the arms of larger banks? Should safety laws prohibit children from normal play activities? All these stupidities can be cured, but only if people with responsibility are given the freedom to use common sense. Giving permits for infrastructure in two years, not 10, would add 1. 5 million jobs and create a greener footprint.  The downside is low. Rigid bureaucracy prevents officials and citizens alike from adapting to rapid changes in global forces. Regulation by results doesn’t guarantee success, but it gives us the freedom to try.

Media: Tell us why you fired Corey Lewandowski! Trump: Tell me how our immigration policies are making the country safer for the people who already live here.

We’ve already admitted millions of Muslim immigrants, but if we don’t take in millions more, the ones we’ve admitted will go on killing sprees?

Like defendants with a losing case being forced to cough up bits of discovery, it took the FBI a week to release a redacted transcript of the Orlando shooter’s 911 call pledging allegiance to ISIS. Even then, the first version came from George Orwell’s Ministry of Truth: “I pledge allegiance to (omitted) may God protect him (in Arabic) on behalf of (omitted). ” That was too much even for Speaker Paul “That’s Not Who We Are” Ryan, prompting the FBI to produce the full version of at least one of Omar’s calls. (It turns out, he wasn’t pledging allegiance to Wayne LaPierre or Phyllis Schlafly.) To hide the epidemic of immigrant mass murders, all the lists have to include massacres from a time when there weren’t many immigrants here  —   before Kennedy’s Immigration Act had fully kicked in and overwhelmed our country with the Third World. Fox News ran a chart compiled by Mother Jones magazine that includes mass shootings from the 1980s. Why not the 1960s? Why not include Bonnie and Clyde? Could we look at mass murders from the last decade? Those include: 2016: Orlando, Florida,   Afghan immigrant Omar Mateen  —   49 dead, 2015: San Bernardino, California,   and   Pakistani immigrants Tashfeen Malik and Syed Farook  —   14 dead, 2015: Chattanooga, Tennessee, Kuwaiti immigrant Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez  —   5 dead, 2014: Isla Vista, California,   immigrant from England, Elliot Rodger  —   6 dead, 2013: The Boston Marathon, Chechen immigrants Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev  —   4 dead, 2009: Fort Hood, Texas, Palestinian   immigrant Nidal Hasan  —   13 dead, 2009: Binghamton, New York, Vietnamese immigrant Jiverly Wong  —   13 dead, 2007: Virginia Tech, South Korean immigrant   Cho  —   32 dead. In the same time period, about a   mass murders were committed by American white men in their own country, where  —   despite Teddy Kennedy’s best efforts  —   they far outnumber Vietnamese, Pakistanis and Afghans. All the American shooters were visible nut cases, who never should have been let out of a  . Their psychotic episodes wouldn’t even count as mass shootings if committed by immigrants. Pakistani Naveed Haq’s 2006 mass shooting at the Seattle Jewish Federation, for example, isn’t generally included on lists of terrorist attacks because, according to his parents, he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was on lithium. Why do we need this? How are our current immigration policies helping the people who already live here? How are they making our country better, stronger, safer? The operation to remake our country began with lies and has been sustained with lies ever since. Teddy Kennedy swore up and down that his 1965 Immigration Act would preserve America’s traditional “ethnic mix” and would not “inundate” our country with people from “deprived nations. ” In fact, his law brought in the poorest of the poor, from the most dysfunctional cultures in the world, and effected the most dramatic demographic transformation of any nation in all of human history. But today, you’re Hitler if you support Teddy Kennedy’s original claims about his own bill. COPYRIGHT 2016 ANN COULTER DISTRIBUTED BY UNIVERSAL UCLICK": "38265",

    "A beef between students in Midtown spilled into the streets Wednesday  —   with four teens  stabbed in front of their high school during a bloody, broad daylight brawl, officials said. The fight unfolded outside of PS35 on West 52nd Street near 8th Avenue in Hell’s Kitchen at around 1:20 pm. according to police. “First it was one kid stabbed, then two, then it was three, then four,” recalled a building worker, who was in the area, and asked to not be named.  “There were kids running,” he told The Post. “It was a melee. ” A    boy wound up being stabbed in the stomach and back, a    boy was stabbed in the ear, an    was stabbed in the arm, and another teen was wounded when all was said and done, police sources said. They were each taken to local hospitals and were expected to survive. The victims were all students at PS35, officials said.  Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce explained at a press conference Wednesday afternoon that the    stemmed from an ongoing beef between two high school students, who had been suspended for fighting. “They had fought last week, a fist fight, last Thursday,” Boyce said. “This afternoon  …    the fight resumed. ” The two students, both 16, had just returned from their suspension on Wednesday when they met up outside to once again settle their dispute with fists, Boyce said. “One    began to win the fight, others then jumped in,” Boyce told reporters.  At some point, one of the teens involved pulled a knife and plunged it into the four victims before fleeing north on 8th Avenue.  The    was still being sought by police as of 2:30 p. m. Wednesday, officials said. Another worker at a nearby building, who also didn’t want to be named, described how two of the teens that the boy allegedly stabbed stumbled inside and begged him for help moments later. “There was two, one got it in the gut and one in the arm,” he said, recalling how the teen with the stomach wound wouldn’t stop bleeding. “He was just moaning in pain,” the man said. “I brought him some Bounty to try to keep [the bleeding under control]. It was gushing out. ” Several residents and workers in the neighborhood claimed the school that the students go to is basically a battleground.  “These kids are always fighting,” explained the first building worker. “Some of them are the worst of the worst.

    "With an attack on a Syrian air base, the United States has now bombed the two main players in Syrian war  —   President Bashar Assad’s military and the Islamic State. This raises a fundamental question about U. S. aims in the Syrian war: If the two most powerful groups in Syria are both unacceptable, what outcome is the U. S. seeking? Both Barack Obama and President Trump have sought to limit U. S. involvement in Syria for their own reasons. Yet both have been sucked in and struggled to clearly define their objectives in the messy, complicated war. Michael O’Hanlon of the Brookings Institution said he supported the strikes. But, he added, ”There is no obvious military step that could follow. What is needed is a political strategy for Syria that squares this circle. Assad must go, yet he will likely stay. That is a paradox that requires creative thinking.” Here’s a look at several key questions surrounding U. S. policy: What is the U. S. goal? Obama wanted to shrink the U. S. military footprint in Middle East, and resisted pressure to take military action in the wake of Syria’s 2011 uprising. He never ordered an attack against the Syrian government, but Obama did launch the bombing campaign against the Islamic State as it rapidly expanded in 2014. His aim was to defeat ISIS on the battlefield and seek a negotiated political deal with Assad. Obama’s air war made progress against ISIS, but peace efforts with Assad went nowhere. Until this week, Trump’s stated goal was to ramp up Obama’s bombing campaign against ISIS, while accepting the reality of Assad as Syria’s leader. But after Tuesday’s apparent chemical weapons attack, Trump said Wednesday, ”My attitude toward Syria and Assad has changed very much.” Trump hasn’t defined the outcome he seeks. But Secretary of State Rex Tillerson now says Assad should have ”no role” in governing Syria  —   a reversal from the administration position just days earlier. Are more U. S. strikes against Assad likely? Many analysts see the U. S. strike, which included 59 Tomahawk missiles fired from two U. S. warships in the eastern Mediterranean, as a   response. ”The first thing I thought of was, ’Wow, just like [President] Bill Clinton used to lob cruise missiles at [Iraqi leader] Saddam Hussein in the 1990s,” Robert Ford, the former U. S. ambassador to Syria, told NPR. ”And Saddam Hussein never changed, and things just went on as they were.” By most assessments, Assad is in his strongest position in several years, though his country keeps spiraling downward in an unending humanitarian crisis. With help from Russia and Iran, Assad’s army has retaken the major cities in the heavily populated western part of the country, while the Islamic State remains on the defensive due to the U. S. bombing campaign in the eastern part. What does this mean for relations with Russia? U. S.  relations just became even more troubled. Russia is heavily invested in Syria, its only real ally in the Arab world, and it condemned the U. S. military action. Dmitri Peskov, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, said Friday the U. S. strike ”deals a significant blow to relations between Russia and America, which are already in a poor state,” according to the news agency RIA. One of the few shared U. S.  aims is the fight against terrorism, and Peskov said the American action ”creates a serious obstacle for building an international coalition to fight it and to effectively resist this universal evil.” Tillerson heads to Moscow next week, and the Syrian conflict could supersede the swirling controversy over Russian meddling in last year’s U. S. presidential election. What’s the state of battle against the Islamic State? The U. S. bombing campaign, backed by close to 1, 000 U. S. forces on the ground and allied local fighters, has been edging closer to the ISIS headquarters in Raqqa. The U. S. and its local partners are about 20 miles from the town in   Syria, along the Euphrates River. But the Pentagon has warned that it could be a long, hard fight. Even if ISIS is driven out of Raqqa and a few smaller towns it controls, who would take over? The U. S. doesn’t want to occupy it, and the American partners are relatively small factions that aren’t well positioned to run the place. For example, the main U. S. ally in the region is a Kurdish faction, while Raqqa is a mostly Sunni Arab city. What’s happened to the other rebel groups supported by the U. S.? These moderate opposition groups were prominent in the early days of the uprising. But as the war intensified, they lost ground to the Syrian military and radical Islamist groups. The CIA and the U. S. military have tried to boost the moderate rebels, with no success. The U. S.  rebels are now bit players. They are involved in talks outside of Syria, and are still working with U. S. officials. But right now, they aren’t significant actors in the war and don’t have a realistic chance of taking on a major political role. In this environment, Assad argues he’s the only plausible option to lead the country. Otherwise, he claims, Syria would be overtaken by a terrorist group like ISIS. What are the prospects for ending the Syrian war? Periodic   talks in Kazakhstan have failed to stop the bloodletting. Political negotiations in Geneva have also proved futile, getting bogged down on the question of Assad’s future role. Spoiler alert: Assad says he must stay opponents say he must go. If the U. S. and its allies drive ISIS out of Raqqa and other cities, that could alter the trajectory of the war, but such a blow is likely months away at minimum, according to analysts. And if the U. S. strike against Assad’s military was just a   event, the impact will probably be limited. ”This isn’t a big blow for Assad and his forces,” said Ford, the former ambassador. ”He is still, little by little, advancing in the Syrian civil war. He is still, little by little, winning.” Greg Myre is a national security correspondent. Follow him @gregmyre1.": "163621",
    "(CNN) Until now, Greg Gianforte, a candidate in Thursday’s special congressional election in Montana, was known as a multimillionaire tech entrepreneur who once ran for governor.  But the Republican redefined himself Wednesday when he was charged with misdemeanor assault after allegedly body slamming a reporter just hours before the polls open.  Gianforte, whose campaign has enjoyed strong support from President Donald Trump, is making a bid for Montana’s lone seat in Congress, which was vacated when Republican Ryan Zinke became Trump’s interior secretary. Some see this race as a referendum on Trump’s young presidency.  Tech guru enters politics, Gianforte, 56, started RightNow Technologies decades ago from his home in Bozeman, and sold it to Oracle in 2012. READ MORE: Big Sky battle: The singer vs. the millionaire, He mounted a failed bid last year for Montana governor, spending an estimated $5. 1 million of his own money on the race.  Asked why he wants to serve in Congress, Gianforte told CNN that he would be a ”strong voice for Montana in DC.” He also talked about raising four kids in Montana.  In this race, Gianforte has raised about $2. 3 million, compared with his Democratic opponent, Rob Quist, with $3. 3 million, Federal Election Commission records show. Gianforte also lent his campaign $1 million. Trump backs candidate, The Trump administration has lent plenty of support to Gianforte. Vice President Mike Pence and Donald Trump Jr. both have campaigned for him, and the President just recorded a robocall in a push to turn out GOP voters. ”Hi, this is President Donald Trump, and I know what the people of Montana really want and really care about,” he says in the recorded call. ”If you don’t vote . .. the liberal Democrats running for Congress will decimate and dismantle all that we’ve done. . ..

Gianforte allegedly body slammed Ben Jacobs, a reporter for The Guardian, and broke his glasses, according to an audio recording of the event and eyewitness accounts. ”He took me to the ground,” Jacobs said. But Gianforte’s campaign said Jacobs acted aggressively toward the candidate, shoved a recorder into his face, grabbed him by the wrist and pulled them both to the ground.

    "A number of unanswered questions surround the medical treatment the late pop icon Prince received after his private plane made an emergency landing at Quad City International Airport in Moline, Illinois in the early morning hours of Friday, April 15. [Six days later the    Prince died at his residence in Chanhassen, Minnesota on Thursday, April 21.  Breitbart News can confirm that a private plane made an emergency landing at Quad City International Airport at 1:15 am April 15 and departed that same day at 11:30 am. “We did have an emergency landing at about 1:15 in the morning on the April 15th,” Jeff Patterson, Public Safety Manager at Quad City International Airport, tells Breitbart News. “It was a call for an unresponsive person. Our officers met the plane, and called for the Moline Fire Department, which transported the person to a local hospital,” Patterson says. “I can confirm it was Trinity Hospital,” he adds. “The plane left Quad City International Airport at approximately 11:30 am on April 15,” Patterson notes. But a spokesperson for UnityPoint Health  —   Trinity Hospital in Moline would not confirm that Prince was ever treated there. “We had no patient by that name in our directory. There is a registration process for any patient who is admitted,” a spokesperson for UnityPoint Health   Hospital tells Breitbart News. That carefully parsed, HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) compliant answer, however, is a marked contrast to the unequivocal denial that Prince had ever been a patient Breitbart News received from Genesis Medical Center in nearby Silvis, Illinois, the only other hospital in the metropolitan Moline area. Breitbart News pressed UnityPoint   Hospital for more details after confirming sources identified it as the hospital to which Prince was taken on April 15. “As you know federal privacy laws prohibit all hospitals from sharing information about any individual without their written approval. Confidentiality is important as health care and medical treatment is personal and private,” the spokesperson responded. “Federal privacy laws cover an individual 50 years past one’s death,” the spokesperson added. A number of questions remain concerning the medical treatment of Prince during the 10 hours and 15 minutes his private plane was on the ground at Quad City International Airport in Moline, Illinois on April 15. On the day of the incident, TMZ reported: 3:30 PM PST  —   A rep for Prince tells TMZ, the singer has been fighting the flu for several weeks. He canceled 2 shows on April 7th but wanted to make Thursday night’s performance in Atlanta, even though he was still not feeling well. After the show, he got on a plane and felt considerably worse, so his plane made an emergency landing in Moline, Illinois, where he was taken to the hospital and treated. He was released 3 hours later, got back on the plane and is now back home. Prince was rushed to a hospital early Friday morning after his jet made an emergency landing in Illinois   …     TMZ has learned. According to our sources, Prince’s private plane made an unscheduled landing at Quad City International Airport in Moline just after 1 AM. The singer was immediately transported by ambulance to a nearby hospital. A source close to the    singer tells us he’s been released and is doing okay. The nature of the medical emergency is unclear. The Rock and Roll Hall of Famer had performed Thursday night in Atlanta   …     and he was in the air for only a short time before things went south. On Thursday, after news of his death earlier in the day had been made public, TMZ provided more details: Multiple sources in Moline tell us, Prince was rushed to a hospital and doctors gave him a “save shot”   …     typically administered to counteract the effects of an opiate. Our sources further say doctors advised Prince to stay in the hospital for 24 hours. His people demanded a private room, and when they were told that wasn’t possible   …     Prince and co. decided to bail. The singer was released 3 hours after arriving and flew home. We’re told when Prince left he “was not doing well. ” We know authorities in Minnesota are trying to get the hospital records from Moline to help determine cause of death. That same day Mother Jones reported that “Naloxone, the   injectable ‘miracle drug’ used in hospitals for decades, more accessible for use outside the hospital. Naloxone can save a user’s life by reversing the effects of opiates. ” The reporting on Prince’s emergency landing in Moline, Illinois on April 15 leads to a number of unanswered questions, made even more significant in light of his death six days later: 1. Are reports that Prince left the care of the hospital in Moline on April 15 due to not being provided a private room true? 2. Was the drug Naloxone or a similar “save shot” administered to Prince while under the care of first responders or a hospital in Moline on April 15? 3. Why was Prince released from the Moline hospital so quickly, after being transported there when it was determined he was “unresponsive” just a few hours earlier at the time his private plane landed in the Quad Cities Airport in Moline on April 15? Breitbart News has also requested confirmation from the City of Moline’s Freedom of Information Act Office, which is handling all inquiries regarding the activities of the Moline Fire Department on April 15. In that FOIA request, we asked the City of Moline to confirm the time of day the Moline Fire Department transported Prince, or the unresponsive person, from the Quad Cities Airport to Trinity Hospital, as well as the time at which he departed the airport and the time he arrived at Trinity Hospital.

    "The U. S. dollar rose against the yen on Tuesday on    U. S. housing data and expectations for a hawkish Federal Reserve, but remained below a recent   high in thin holiday trading.  The S&P CoreLogic   composite index of home prices in 20 metropolitan areas rose 0. 6 percent in October from a revised 0. 5 percent in September on a seasonally adjusted basis. This outpaced expectations of economists polled by Reuters for a 0. 5 percent increase. The data helped underscore expectations that the Fed would raise interest rates at a faster pace next year, a view that gained traction after the Fed on Dec. 14 projected three rate hikes next year, up from the two foreseen in September. The data also sent U. S. Treasury yields higher.  Trading was thin as markets in Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Hong Kong were closed for holidays.  ”The prospect of Fed tightening next year is keeping bonds under pressure, yields up and the dollar bid, and obviously the   data is helping that,” said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York.

It actively votes down even the most modest efforts to save at least a few lives and to make killing a little less likely the next time around. Another day, another dead gun control measure. And the media treats the event accordingly. This struck me today when I looked at my morning newspapers. (I love the online world, but still like to read print newspapers, which might simply mean I am of a certain age.) The Post story on the Senate’s shameful cave to the gun lobby ran in the middle of Page A4 under the headline “4   proposals fail to advance in the Senate. ” The New York Times ran its account at the bottom of Page A12, with a similar headline. The Wall Street Journal ran its account at the bottom of Page A3. I get the news judgment here: Big news would have been something happening. Still, I would have liked at least one of the papers to put the gun   on its front page, on the theory that what we do about gun violence is at least as important to us as the firing of Donald Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, about which the media went absolutely gaga. But there is something else: What happened this week will be marked over the long run as the beginning of the end of gun lobby dominance. First, advocates of   gun measures  —   I use the PR term we gun controllers have decided upon because I believe it’s accurate  —   put up a fight of a sort we have not seen before.    The Senate voted down four measures Monday evening relating to gun measures after hearing debate from both Republican and Democratic senators. The vote comes one week after a gunman opened fire in an Orlando nightclub, killing 49 people before being killed by police. (Reuters)   The filibuster mounted by Sen. Chris Murphy ( .) joined by Sen. Cory Booker ( . J.) and others, marked a sea change. Typically, advocates of doing something spent weeks and weeks trying to negotiate some package that just might draw this or that timid senator away from his or her absolute fear of the gun lobby. The   measure would be defeated anyway. This time, the advocates of an assault weapons ban and     legislation said: Enough. We want a vote on the actual bills we would like to see passed. If our opponents want to demonstrate that they would rather kowtow to the National Rifle Association than do something about potential terrorists getting guns, go ahead. Make our day. Let your constituents know that when push comes to shove, you do not mean a single word you say about the urgency of fighting terrorism. If the NRA says it’s better to risk terrorists getting guns than to make any change in the law, let’s see how many senators  —   almost all of them Republicans  —   will go with the NRA. And see you in November when the voters have a say. You could see the defensiveness on the part of senators who always bow before the gun lobby. “No one wants terrorists to be able to buy guns or explosives,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( . ). Oh really? Then why not vote that way? That McConnell said this shows the extent to which the terrorism issue has called the gun extremists’ bluff. There is even talk that something might actually happen. Sen. Susan Collins ( ) is trying to muster 60 votes for a compromise measure that would keep guns out of the hands of a much smaller number of suspected terrorists than would have been covered under the amendment proposed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( .) that was voted down. It’s important to see what is happening here. In a normal compromise, people who feel strongly on one side reach agreement with people who feel strongly on the other. In this case, the gun lobby’s position is so extreme that “compromise” means a rather paltry piece of legislation. Nonetheless, that Collins is getting some support from her fellow Republicans hints they may be genuinely worried that voting against the views of an overwhelming majority of Americans could carry a real political price. I thought that Lawrence O’Donnell, a host for MSNBC (where I do some work) and a former staffer to Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, had it right Monday night about the trajectory of this issue. He pointed out that supporters of reform must often absorb the heat after defeat before they achieve victory. This has been true of many of our most important reforms, from the creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority to the securing of labor rights under the Wagner Act to the advances in health care represented by Medicare and Obamacare. A Pyrrhic victory is a triumph “achieved at too great a cost. ” The gun lobby’s victories Monday fit that classic definition. The tide will turn.": "212951",
    "Sanders’ supporters are alleging that foul play by casino managers helped Clinton out in Saturday’s contest, while Clinton’s camp has blasted   in at times vulgar terms   the Vermont senator’s assertion he took the state’s Latino vote. The tensions reflect the tight battle between the two heading into next Saturday’s South Carolina primary. Sanders, who had surged in recent months to challenge   Clinton, is trying to maintain momentum against her in a part of the United States where she wields an advantage among minority voters.     The angrier tone also marks a turn from what has been a mostly civil race on the Democratic side, in contrast with the noisy   that has characterized much of the Republican race. . While Sanders and the former first lady have publicly clashed on their approaches to healthcare and regulating Wall Street, they have frequently emphasized their common ground on social issues. Sanders has also refused so far to join in Republican attacks on Clinton’s record as secretary of state. ”Let’s talk about the real issues facing America,” he said during one televised debate. The tone soured after Nevada. Officials with National Nurses United, which endorsed Sanders, have said there were irregularities at casino caucus sites   such as casino managers wearing Clinton paraphernalia   which they said amounted to intimidation of casino employee voters. ”From what nurses observed in Nevada Sanders campaign should call for UN observers to protect democracy,” the union said in one Twitter post on Sunday. Neither Clinton nor Sanders’ campaigns immediately responded to requests for comment on the allegations. Meanwhile, both campaigns have argued about what the polling from the Nevada caucuses show. One set of entrance and exit poll results conducted by CBS News showed Sanders took 53 percent of Latino votes in the state. This is a critical group for Sanders as he seeks to broaden his support base after his early results   a very narrow loss and a decisive win   in Iowa and New Hampshire, which have overwhelmingly white voter populations. ”I don’t typically like to swear on Twitter, but by all accounts so far this is complete and utter bullshit,” Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill wrote on Twitter, referring to a Sanders’ campaign press release asserting he took the Latino bloc in Nevada. Clinton has been expected to find easier territory as  contests move into the south in the    battles to pick a party presidential nominee for the November general election. Her backers say minority voters are her ”firewall” against Sanders’ popularity among young voters who dislike establishment politics and are attracted by his vows to take on Wall Street excesses and high college fees. She won Nevada, which is nearly a quarter Latino, by just over 5 points. Sanders’ camp, meanwhile, has disputed Clinton camp assertions that she drew the lion’s share of the union votes in the Nevada contest, accusing her campaign of inventing figures.  ”They do have a tendency to make stuff up,” Sanders’ spokesman Michael Briggs said in an email. The American Federation of Teachers issued a press release on Monday listing 23 unions that back Clinton.

    "Reddit users were shocked earlier in the week when the site’s front page suddenly became populated entirely by posts from the   Trump subreddit,   . [Late Thursday evening the front page of    became entirely populated with content from    an error that according to    moderator    was caused by an unexplained “bug. ”   Initially users questioned whether or not the sudden page change was an accident or an active effort to take over the    subreddit by    subscribers. However Reddit admins confirmed that this was not the case and was in fact due to a database issue. Reddit admin    said, “My understanding is a database update caused the process that updates    to stop working properly, the long and short of it is that    is incredibly active voting wise, so when the algorithm [that] sorts    broke  …    that subreddit was the one to be pulled into the vortex. ” “The    algorithm doesn’t single out any specific subreddits, but it does make it so no single subreddit can take over completely,” they explained. “The_Donald happens to be incredibly active voting wise (more so than larger subreddits) so when things broke the posts in that subreddit were the ones most actively being voted on and got picked up. ” The explanation seamingly admits that posts from the Trump subreddit would make up the majority of Reddit’s front page if not for the algorithim artificially suppressing them. The   subreddit has come under fire from Reddit admins in the past who have actively worked to prevent    content from reaching the front page, even going as far as to alter the Reddit front page algorithm to deal with the influx of    posts to the site’s frontpage.

    "Kathy Griffin held a press conference Friday morning to address her   shock photo of a “beheaded” President Donald Trump, telling reporters that the Trump family has tried to “ruin” her in the wake of the controversy and vowing to continue to make fun of the president. [Standing next to her attorney Lisa Bloom, the    My Life on the   star said the firestorm generated by the photograph  —   after which she was fired from CNN and had at least five scheduled performances cancelled  —   would have never occurred had the photograph been taken by a male artist.  “I don’t think I will have a career after this. I’m going to be honest, he broke me,” Griffin said as she began to choke up. “If you don’t stand up, you get run over,” she added. “What’s happening to me has never happened ever in the history of this great country. Which is that a sitting president of the United States and his grown children and the First Lady are personally, I feel, personally trying to ruin my life forever. ” “He picked me, I’m the easiest target,” she continued. (Watch: Press conference begins at the 40:22 mark) Griffin said the widespread backlash she has faced over the photo is part of a sexist campaign to destroy her career. “It’s a bunch of white guys trying to silence me,” she said. “This wouldn’t be happening to a guy. This is a woman thing. ” Griffin told reporters that the process of preparing for the photograph took just minutes, and was intended to be a parody of the president’s comments about former Fox News anchor Megan Kelly, when he said last year after a presidential debate that the anchor “had blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her whatever. ” “I said let’s get in trouble, let’s give them something to talk about,” Griffin recalled, adding that she “never imagined it could be misinterpreted. ” During the press conference, Griffin was asked about a report that claimed Trump’s youngest son,    Barron Trump, was traumatized by the image after he saw it on television, because he did not know who Griffin was or the context in which the photograph was taken. “Allegedly” traumatized, Bloom replied. “You’re assuming everything the Trumps say is true. ” Griffin, for her part, said she “would never want to hurt anyone, especially a child. ” The comedian reiterated that she meant what she said in her apology video earlier this week, in which she said the image  —   taken by L. A.  photographer Tyler Shields, who has since defended the work  —   had gone “too far” and that she had “crossed a line. ” But Griffin added that she would continue to make fun of the president in the wake of the controversy. Another attorney for Griffin confirmed during the press conference that the Secret Service had opened an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the photo shoot. Reaction to the press conference came swiftly on Twitter, as “Lisa Bloom” began trending on the social media platform Friday morning.

    "BAGHDAD, Iraq  —   Soldiers cheered and honked the horns of their Humvees as their convoy rolled north on the highway out of Baghdad. One filmed the procession on his phone to mark the event: The Iraqi military was getting ready to return to Mosul. “I’m higher than the palm trees,” another soldier said. The Iraqi military surrendered Mosul to ISIS in June 2014, leaving behind their   weapons and setting the stage for the declaration of ISIS’s caliphate. Now the same Iraqi military, reinforced with more than two years of US training and aid, is beginning a massive offensive to win Mosul back. Kurdish forces could initiate attacks on outlying villages as part of the offensive as early as this weekend  —   and Iraqi troops, who will be the primary force in the offensive, will follow suit either in unison or shortly afterward. The stakes for all sides are high. For ISIS, Mosul is the most populous and important city it holds. It was the first modern terrorist group to control its own state  —   and losing Mosul would set the stage for that state’s demise. For the Iraqi government, retaking Mosul is crucial to rebuilding the country. And the Mosul offensive will be the capstone of a long and expensive US effort against ISIS that has seen it arm and train local forces, launch thousands of airstrikes and send US troops to the front lines. The offensive is also critical for an Iraqi military still trying to bounce back from 2014’s historic collapse  —   and the fate of the battle will rest with its soldiers. The start of the offensive raises a pressing question: can the same military that lost Mosul to ISIS win it back? Iraqi and US military planners will lead with their best shot. The troops in the convoy were members of Iraq’s elite special forces units, who have been the most effective forces in battling the militants in their Sunni Arab strongholds. Known as the   Service (CTS)  —   as well as Iraqi   Forces, Iraqi Special Operations Forces, or simply the Golden Division  —   they were founded by the US military after its invasion of Iraq in 2003. The CTS went on to become a key US partner during the occupation, helping to fight ISIS’s predecessor,   in Iraq, as well as Shiite militia. Many of its members were trained by US troops and are quick to recount fighting alongside them. In the war on ISIS, the CTS has led the way with key victories across the country. Their reward will be an exhaustive deployment in the largest battle against ISIS to date. “This is the final battle. This is to be or not to be,” said Sabah Noori, a spokesman for Iraqi special forces in Baghdad. “The future of Iraq is at stake in Mosul. And we will be in the front. ” The convoy’s drive north from Baghdad this week, to a makeshift base some 30 miles outside Mosul, stretched for 300 miles through   terrain. Towns and villages along the roadside had been reduced to rubble by the grueling campaign to roll back ISIS, and many still stand empty many months after being reclaimed. Toppled electric towers, destroyed homes, and car frames twisted from airstrikes were all common sights. Humvees in the long convoy bore signs of the long struggle too  —   almost all had indents from gunshots in their   glass. Gas tankers, armed personnel carriers, supply trucks and transport buses, painted in the CTS’s trademark black, filled out the procession. The vehicles arrived throughout the night in an abandoned village, and the troops scrambled to arrange their makeshift base. “One day I will be proud that I participated in the start of this offensive,” said one of the CTS’s top commanders, Maj. Salam Hussein, standing on a rooftop and looking out toward Mosul. “Right now we have a job to do. ” When the battle for Mosul begins, US fighter pilots will be flying over a uniquely modern field of war. On one side will be ISIS’s multinational militant army, with its squadrons of suicide bombers and fleets of   truck bombs. On the other, the Iraqi army, Kurdish peshmerga and Sunni Arab tribesmen will be advancing with small groups of US commandos among their ranks, as uniformed US soldiers may cover their advances with heavy artillery. Shiite militia fighters, who are sanctioned by the Iraqi government and have worked in the past with advisers from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, will be working in coordination with these   forces. Spurred by the shock of Mosul’s fall and put together on the fly amid the chaos that followed, often with a reluctant White House getting in the way, the strategy US military planners have created to roll back ISIS will face its most important test in Mosul. This strategy has relied on local forces, supported by US air power and advisers, to do the bulk of the fighting, shifting the burden of executing the war from masses of conventional US soldiers to small and elite units of US commandos who act as a force multiplier. These commandos are embedded with a dizzying array of armed groups  —   from   Kurdish militia in Syria to Arab tribesmen in Iraq and the peshmerga. They help to coordinate battles as well as arm and train their local allies, while also working in the shadows on select missions to take the fight to ISIS themselves. If the   effort is successful, it will signal the end of ISIS as a   force in Iraq, setting the stage for the isolation and eventual loss of its remaining territory in the country. At the peak of its military surge in the summer of 2014, ISIS controlled as much as 40 percent of Iraq. That number has shrunk to 10 percent today, with the bulk of people living under ISIS control concentrated in Mosul, which the Iraqi government estimates to contain at least one million civilians. ISIS’s Syrian capital of Raqqa, far smaller with some 200, 000 residents, could be won more easily once its supply routes from Iraq are cut. A defeat in Mosul would also be a defeat for the revolutionary core of the ISIS ideology  —   the idea of creating a caliphate across the borders of established countries, the promise to let its members live its hardline vision in the here and now, and the call for recruits to create a new world order as they destroy the old. Mosul has been crucial to ISIS’s identity from the start: While in Syria it won its territory from weaker rebel groups, in Mosul it defeated the   Iraqi army. It then paraded the captured US tanks and weapons for its TV cameras and bulldozed the border with Syria. It was at central Mosul’s Grand Mosque that ISIS’s leader, Abu Bakr   declared himself the new global caliph, delivering a call to arms: “Do jihad in the cause of God, incite the believers, and be patient in the face of this hardship. ” Because of the importance of Mosul to ISIS, soldiers and analysts alike expect the militants there to put up a bitter fight. They have been preparing their defenses for more than two years  —   digging tunnels, planting IEDs and, recently, filling trenches with oil to burn for cover from airstrikes. “That’s the   question. I lean toward a heavy fight,” said Omar Lamrani, a military specialist at the intelligence firm Stratfor, who said that at least 5, 000 ISIS fighters remained in the city. “And we’ve seen so much planning  —   tunnels, mines. I think it will be a significant stand. ” There were two Iraqi military divisions, numbering some 20, 000 soldiers, posted in Mosul when ISIS invaded the city with an estimated 1, 500 fighters. Most simply panicked and fled  —   and soldiers who were part of the rout later recounted that phone calls alerting them that the feared militants were coming was enough to get entire units to desert their posts. The US government suffered a black eye too in the defeat: when the Obama administration decided, in the face of heated domestic objections, to pull US troops from the country in 2011, it argued that the US trained and equipped Iraqi military could manage Iraq’s tenuous security situation on its own. Mosul provides a chance for both sides to right the wrong. And though Iraqi special forces have proven their merit in battling the militants, it is the   Iraqi military that will have to provide the bulk of the soldiers for the offensive  —   and hold the ground once it is won. Key to that mission is the Iraqi army’s 15th Division, which was built from scratch with the help of the US military and its allies in the aftermath of Mosul. Many of its soldiers and officers were part of the divisions that collapsed in Mosul  —   and eager for redemption, said Michael Knights, an Iraq expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who has embedded with local forces around the country. “Their story was we want to get back there and we’re feeling a bit of shame,” he said. “The guys who ran away are coming back. ” Shaping operations to set the stage for the offensive have been underway for months. From here, the offensive will likely play out in two stages. First,   forces are expected to advance toward the city and attempt to encircle it. Next would be the push into the city itself. “The main assault [of the first phase] is to happen west of the Tigris heading up north toward the mountains overlooking Mosul,” Lamrani said. “This will be the main thrust and spearheaded by 25, 000 Iraqi military and CTS and supported by tribal militia. And peshmerga would attack at the same time. At the end of that we’ll get to the point where Mosul is surrounded on all sides. ” US planners would likely seek to leave a small opening toward Syria “in the hope that ISIS fighters take that gap and flee because they would rather fight them in the open rather than in the city, especially in Mosul, where they have high density civilian areas,” Lamrani said. As CTS troops readied for the offensive at their base 3o miles outside Mosul, a senior officer with a long history of fighting ISIS cautioned against trying to predict how the battle with the extremists would play out. “You’re operating in an environment where your enemy is ready to do anything. Not just die  —   when I say ready to do anything, I mean he is ready to put civilians in danger to the furthest extent that he can. ” An official with the Kurdistan Regional Government likewise cautioned that it could be a difficult and unpredictable fight. “We are expecting up to six months of    fighting,” he said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t permitted to share this internal assessment. “It’s going to be a long, long battle. ” Just as crucial to winning the battle for Mosul will be the way that it is carried out. Aid groups have been sounding the alarm about a looming humanitarian disaster due to the civilians packed into the city. Shiite militia, which have faced accusations of committing crimes against Sunni civilians, have also vowed to push into   Mosul, despite U. S. objections, as part of the assault. The way those civilians are treated  —   and the way the assault on their home city plays out  —   will have a big effect on how they see the government that comes next. “This is probably the one time that Mosul will greet Americans with flowers and candy as they had predicted back in 2003,” said Rasha Al Aqeedi, a Mosul native and analyst at the Al Mesbar Studies and Research Center in Dubai. “I do believe that at this point that [Mosul residents] are so desperate they just want anyone to liberate them. They just don’t want the city to be completely ruined, and they want to survive it. ”": "111975",

    "Kirsten Evans, executive director of  In Defense of Christians, spoke about the genocide perpetrated against Christians in the Middle East on the Good Friday edition of Breitbart News Daily. [“We’re in a critical moment, a critical situation,” she said.  Evans noted that people in the West sometimes forget “we are all sons and daughters, in some way, of Middle Eastern Christians. Christianity came to us, in the West, first and foremost through the Middle East, through the early Church. The world owes Middle Eastern Christianity for the passing on of the faith, before it became a global community and global faith. ” For this reason, she said the destruction of ancient Christian communities at the hands of Islamist forces, such as ISIS, should be a “concern to all of us, not just from a geopolitical perspective, but also from a very personal perspective  —   a personal identification with our brothers and sisters in those communities, who are living in a dire situation. ” “Without a doubt, especially with the rise of fundamentalist Islam, and in a very particular way with the rise of ISIS, we’re seeing a very targeted persecution of the Christian community in the Middle East  …     in particular in Iraq and Syria, but definitely not limited to Iraq and Syria.  Of course, we definitely all saw the tragic events in Yemen, with the Missionaries of Charity. ” This was a reference to the massacre of four nuns, plus 12 other civilians, at a retirement home in Yemen earlier this month. As host Stephen K. Bannon observed, ISIS savages murdered the nuns by tying them to trees and smashing their heads in, martyring them “just like in Second Century Rome. ” “They were targeted precisely because of their faith,” Evans agreed, “women who were just doing services, works of mercy to the community, but were targeted because of their Christian identity. ” She said the nuns lived, and died, “heroically. ” When Bannon asked where the “outrage” over genocide against Christians might be found, noting that the response from both religious and secular leaders has been strangely muted so far, Evans noted that her organization In Defense of Christians is dedicated to raising awareness of the genocide. “We’re trying to mobilize the global conscience, but first and foremost, the conscience of the Christian community  —   expand awareness, and the sense of urgency. Certainly there are people speaking out. Pope Francis has spoken about this, many religious leaders have spoken about this. We’re seeing the Christian community mobilize in aid, and in relief initiatives. ” Bannon acknowledged these responses, and the efforts conducted behind the scenes by figures such as the Pope and the Archbishop of Canterbury on behalf of Middle Eastern Christian communities under siege, but argued that the world’s response was still much too reserved in the face of “a   outright focus on the eradication of the Church,” which could change the Christian face forever by destroying “the taproot of our belief. ” Evans agreed that more needed to be done, beginning with Christians demanding a stronger response from their pastors, communities, and church leaders. “Where we feel like maybe the messaging is weak, where our pastors are silent, let’s ask them to raise their voices,” she urged. In addition to helping through her own organization and its website, InDefenseOfChristians. org, Evans suggested those interested in standing against the Christian genocide could open their own local chapters, and mobilize their communities to put pressure on political representatives, as well as making donations to groups that are providing aid to displaced Christians from the Middle East.

    "Mayor de Blasio will speak next month at a conference titled “ ‘You Are Fake News’: Truth, Lies, Politics in the Age of Trump. ” He’s certainly an expert at denouncing news he doesn’t want to hear  —   and at faking news of his own. The whole thing should be bizarre. The sponsors are Buzzfeed and The Intercept. Buzzfeed, recall,   on President Trump’s supposed ties with Russia. Intercept star Glenn Greenwald slammed it as “a totally anonymous, unverified, unvetted document filled with scurrilous and inflammatory allegations about which its own    says there ‘is serious reason to doubt the allegations.’ ” The  .  fireworks might be worth the $400 fee. But what will de Blasio offer? After all, the mayor has a long record of telling New Yorkers not to believe their own lying eyes  —   or news reports. He spent months denying that homelessness was soaring, even as The Post was running photos of    encampments, before he finally admitted the truth. Last year, he refused to take a Post reporter’s questions   about political operatives paid by the taxpayers as “special assistants. ” He said he was only “calling on real media outlets. ” Back when he was actively denying the massive mismanagement at the Administration for Children’s Services, his answer to The Post’s citing details of a report from city Comptroller Scott Stringer   to create fake news. Every paper in town is reporting on Correction Commissioner Joseph Ponte’s misdoings,   and that the facts “as described in the press” are purely subjective. The mayor’s minions staged a fake exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum to bolster his   cred. His City Hall creates YouTube videos that allege that racism explains public resistance to his   plans.

    "After waiting 58 years to return to a major tournament, Wales made up for lost time with a thrilling victory that gets their Euro 2016 campaign off to the best possible start. It was a dramatic match that swung one way and then the other before Hal   who is currently out of contract with Reading, upstaged Gareth Bale to emerge as an unlikely hero. Introduced as a   substitute, and at a time when the game was in danger of slipping away from Wales after Ondrej Duda had come off the bench to equalise for Slovakia with his first touch,   steered home a   shot to spark wild celebrations on the pitch and in the stands. It was only his third international goal and, with only nine minutes remaining, could not have been timed better. That Joe Ledley, who broke his leg five weeks ago to the day, was involved in the buildup to the defining moment in the match only added to the sense of satisfaction for Wales at the final whistle. Bale flung his head back and roared into the sky at the end of an absorbing game of football that left Chris Coleman’s players looking physically and emotionally drained. The sight of three points on the board should help to accelerate their recovery and, given the new format that opens the door for four   teams to qualify for the knockout stage, Wales could be forgiven for thinking they already have one foot in the last 16. At the very least, they can go into the “Battle of Britain” with England in Lens on Thursday full of confidence and with the pressure off. Bale, as ever, delivered for his country, yet this was not one of those days when it was all about the world’s most expensive footballer. The Real Madrid forward scored a superb   to put Wales ahead and had a powerful header saved in the second half, but for long periods of the game Bale was on the periphery, bereft of service and isolated in attack, no more so than in the   spell at the start of the second half when Slovakia took control of the game. With the excellent Marek Hamsik becoming more and more influential and Wales unable to retain possession, Duda’s   equaliser had been coming. The worry for Wales was that Slovakia were not finished there, which is why Coleman’s decision to bring on Ledley and   was so crucial, not just in terms of their contribution to the winning goal but also to break up the rhythm of the game. There was also something else that happened around the time of those substitutions that captured the mood on this historical day for Wales. With the team looking like they were running on empty, the 25, 000 Wales fans inside the stadium broke into a stirring rendition of the national anthem. Little wonder that Bale said afterwards that it felt like a home game for Wales. It was quite an occasion for Danny Ward, the    Liverpool goalkeeper who was drafted into the team on the eve of the match after Wayne Hennessey was forced to pull out after suffering a back spasm. Ward made his Wales debut only in March and had never previously started a game for his country, but he is entitled to be proud of his performance, as well as a touch relieved that Adam Nemec’s late header struck the upright. Wales will feel that they did enough to deserve that break. After a nervous start, when Hamsik slalomed through the Wales defence and was denied a brilliant individual goal only by Ben Davies’s superb clearance, Coleman’s side started to move the ball with more belief and grew into the game. Bale’s goal was a beauty and there was a sense of inevitability about what was going to happen from the moment that Jonny Williams was brought down by Patrik Hrosovsky 30 yards from goal. Matus Kozacik, the Slovakia goalkeeper, lined up his wall but made the fatal mistake of taking a step to his left just as Bale started his   leaving a gaping hole on the other side of the goal. Bale, with a dipping   thumped the ball into that area and, although it was not in the corner, Kozacik had too much ground to make up to try and get across his goal. Wales were aggrieved they never had a chance to double their advantage from the penalty spot when Martin Skrtel, trying to shepherd the ball out of play, elbowed Jonny Williams in the face. That incident went unpunished, unlike the poor defending that Duda exposed to equalise shortly after he came on. Robert Mak got away from Aaron Ramsey and Dave Edwards far too easily on the Slovakia right and the winger’s neat   was dispatched by Duda, who drilled a low shot across Ward and into the far corner. Bale and Ramsey both had headed opportunities either side of Duda’s goal but Slovakia also continued to threaten as the game became stretched. Wales badly needed some inspiration and they got it via the substitutes’ bench. Ledley, on for Edwards, threaded the ball into the feet of Ramsey, who nicked it past Skrtel and, a little fortuitously, into the path of  . Shooting on the turn, the striker scuffed the ball through the legs of Jan Durica and past Kozacik. Wales were in dreamland.": "151853",
    "It was one of the world’s largest and most secure paedophile networks  —   an online space where tens of thousands traded horror. The website dealt in abuse video and images of children, swapped and boasted about on a   forum, accessible only through an encrypted browser. Membership was tightly managed. Quiet accounts raised suspicion and could be suddenly terminated. Those who stayed had to upload new material frequently. More than 45, 000 people complied. But what those thousands never realised, even as heavy users began to disappear, was that the site was being run by police.  For six months in 2014, inside a pale office block in the Australian city of Brisbane, an elite squad of detectives were administering the site: analysing images, monitoring conversations, connecting users with their crimes. By the time they pulled the plug on the forum 85 children had been rescued and hundreds of people across the globe arrested. Among them was Richard Huckle, a    Briton living in Malaysia, one of the board’s most prolific members. In June Huckle was sentenced to 22 life terms, one for each of the minors he was convicted of abusing.  Police believe he had at least 169 other young victims. Huckle had diligently recorded their names in a ledger, detailing the acts he had performed with each one. How he was tracked and arrested is a story of persistence, good fortune and an audacious   sting, which key figures inside the specialist police unit responsible, Taskforce Argos in Australia, have granted the Guardian access to share. The loose thread, that once pulled, would unravel Huckle’s world, leads back five years to Toronto, and the warehouse headquarters of businessman Brian Way. The    had built a   film distribution racket worth $4m, which to this day is among the largest ever discovered.  When Canadian police raided his premises they found it piled with refuse, the bathroom sheeted in thick mould. The disarray was typical of a predator’s home.  But Way, who was later convicted of 15 charges related to child abuse images and is awaiting sentencing, kept meticulous records. About a tenth of his 370 customers were based in Queensland. Their details were passed onto Insp Jon Rouse, the grave    who commands Taskforce Argos. Rouse came up through the Queensland police’s child safety group, where he investigated parents who had killed or mistreated their children, before joining Argos in 2000. “When we’re dealing with a video, when you hear children screaming, we’re listening for accents, trying to identify where that abuse is occurring,” he says. “Our job is to investigate it and end it. ” His stern mask drops momentarily recalling “the very first time I saw a video of a child being penetratively raped”. “I could not believe it,” he says. “I was so shocked. ” But to survive you need to “get past your abhorrence and horror” he says. “At the end of the day the best way to deal with this is to see it as digital evidence of the commission of a criminal offence against a child. ” After Way’s capture, dozens of arrests across Queensland followed, including of one man who subscribed to a site Argos had yet to unearth: a vast, highly organised forum, whose name is still suppressed under a strict court order. “One of the Queensland targets was a member,” Rouse says. “When we arrested him we took over his account. ” At that stage “we were just another user” Rouse says. Police discovered an intricate hierarchy operating on the site. “It ran as a company or business,” Rouse says. Senior administrators took charge of individual boards, grouped around categories such as boys or girls, hardcore or  . Users had to upload material at least every 30 days or risk exile. Each of its 45, 000 accounts were ranked according to the quality of their output, with a “producer’s area” walled off to all but the most feted. At the top was one man, “effectively the CEO”. He regularly started his messages with the cheery greeting “hiyas”. Paul Griffiths, a police officer from England with a cropped haircut and a hard stare, worked on Argos in Queensland as a victim identification specialist, scanning gigabytes of images and videos each week looking for clues  —   a brand of food, a grain of wood  —   that might give away a child’s location. Above his desk was a whiteboard scrawled with two dozen usernames: the forum’s most wanted. Huckle’s name made the whiteboard because he was a producer, uploading exclusively fresh material. He was zealous about it. “He belittled others [on the forum] for claiming they were paedophiles,” Griffiths recalls. “He thought they were just sitting at home living off other people’s experiences, where he was out there living the life. ” “[Huckle] talked about leaving a legacy, where he’d be remembered because of the material he produced,” Griffiths says. “He got to the point where he was actually titling his work, saying it was his studio. He was definitely branding. ” To Huckle’s frustration, however, his material was not sought after. “You’ve got the fact he wasn’t particularly popular, he was very arrogant,” Griffiths says.  Huckle took precautions, usually blurring faces and backgrounds, and erasing telltale metadata from his work. Advice, including on how to evade police detection, was readily available on the site. One   manual billed itself as “the exclusive step by step guide for practicing safe and fun sex with children”. Huckle had authored his own   tome, titled “Paedophiles and Poverty: Child Lover Guide”.  In Brisbane, police laboured over the word “hiyas” the word use by the site’s de facto CEO. “It didn’t really look like something that I’d use, or that anyone I know would use in conversation,” Griffiths says. When he punched it into Google, it returned thousands of hits. “All the people I could see using it as a greeting were women. ” Danish authorities had already supplied Argos thin leads that the site’s kingpin was somewhere in Australia, probably Adelaide. Some of the children in the work he produced were clearly Indigenous. In one of his images, a small girl was splayed on a bed, a sheet of paper beside her reading, “Aussie”. A web search for “hiyas” turns up more than 450, 000 results. The odds against police in these investigations are stacked extraordinarily high. What improves them is a basic truth about the people they hunt. “They will make mistakes,” Griffiths says. The man behind the site made at least three, that in time, would lead police crashing through his door. A man was discovered using the giveaway greeting on a   drive discussion forum. He lived in Adelaide. Griffiths’ eyes went wide at his username. It was a close copy of the handle used by the forum’s chief. Another similarly named user  —   liberally sprinkling his posts with “hiyas”  —   was also discovered on a basketball forum. “And I thought, this is just spooky. It’s just too much of a coincidence not to be him,” Griffiths says. The user on the   drive forum had asked for advice on raising his car’s suspension. People had replied suggesting parts. “I actually found someone on Facebook who was trying to source those parts [the user] had been advised to use,” Griffiths recalls.  It was a    named Shannon McCoole. He worked in childcare. “Suddenly it all fell into place,” Griffiths says. “It was a battle stations moment. ” Police moved on McCoole in June 2014. Though news of his arrest was initially suppressed, the fact he worked in state care would eventually trigger a royal commission. It revealed a long trail of red flags raised by McCoole’s colleagues over the four years he spent volunteering for youth services and and eventually working for Families South Australia. They included an anonymous call in March 2011 warning authorities the   was inappropriately physical with some children. It was ignored, along with a psychological assessment one year later, that found him to be “high risk” and “very unsuitable” for the job. Considering these misses elicits the rarest flash of emotion from Rouse. “Looking at the timeline, it’s quite horrendous,” he says. “It’s sickening. But it’s history now. ” McCoole was jailed to face court, but online, his presence barely faltered. Two officers had immediately assumed control of his account. This was in a different league from the earlier takeover of a Queensland account. Now one of the world’s largest online paedophile networks was suddenly being run from the Brisbane headquarters of the Queensland police. In Greek myth, Argos Panoptes was a giant who served as a guard for the queen of the gods, Hera. The beast had one hundred eyes, never closing all at once. “Ever vigilant,” Rouse says.  For six months in 2014 Task Force Argos was   too, with access as McCoole to the forum’s every crevice, and the private messages of all 45, 000 users. Including Richard Huckle’s. His messages provided early clues the man from Kent might not be preying on children in south Asia after all. He had still been careful never to name a country. But to a paedophile based in the Philippines who wrote to him, “pity you’re so far away,” he had replied, “I’m probably closer than you think”. As well, there was intelligence suggesting the offender had spent time in Malaysia. Access to the full suite of Huckle’s material provided the breakthrough. It was not what he photographed, but what he photographed with. Embedded in some of his images, overlooked when he swept the files of metadata, was the brand and model of his Olympus camera. A tiny clue  —   but enough.  Officers exhaustively swept photography sites such as Flickr and TrekEarth for photos taken in   Asia using the make and model. Sure enough, “we find some perfectly legal images from Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, taken with the same make and model of camera”. The photographer also had a penchant for shooting children, sometimes naked, “but nothing illegal in them” he says.  Police traced the legitimate photographs to an email address, which in turn illuminated his accounts on other websites. In an echo of McCoole’s case, one of these accounts was registered under a similar name to that of a paedophile on their site. “And realistically by that stage it was no chance he would be anyone else,” Griffiths says. The digital trail also led to a studio named Huckool Photography Productions. It was based in Malaysia and linked to Huckle’s public Facebook profile. There, he had been more brazen than police could have imagined. “On his photos on Facebook there were photos of similar children, and the same children, that appeared in the abuse material that he published online,” Griffiths says. Some of Huckle’s profiles are still archived. They are a sea of children: in church, dressed as Christmas angels   in water, beaming bunched together, “delightedly   [at] their English photographing uncle” he writes. Some show more brooding glances, and you wonder. Griffiths, who had worked as a police officer in his home city of Manchester, called his counterparts at Britain’s National Crime Agency (NCA) passing on the raw intelligence about Huckle’s crimes and his likely identity. But Huckle would remain in Malaysia untouched for another four months. “As I understand it, the Malaysians believed they didn’t have enough evidence to arrest him,” Griffiths says. (Malaysian police say they were only notified of Huckle’s offending by the NCA in May 2016.) They were so close. Police had an identity, a location, an array of online profiles. But no way to way to reach the man himself. Until Huckle provided one. “I just saw a [Facebook] post he made, basically saying, ‘Great news, I’ve just booked a flight home for Christmas’,” Griffiths says. “He had hashtagged the airline. It was almost too easy. ” Huckle was arrested at Gatwick airport on 19 December 2014. Computers and hard drives in his possession contained more than 20, 000 indecent images of children, around 1, 000 depicting children he had himself abused. To this day he has refused to divulge the keys to encrypted files on his laptop, thought to reveal additional victims, and thousands more images and videos.  Huckle’s trial received sensational media coverage in the UK, including his branding as “Britain’s   paedophile”.  Around the time Huckle was arrested in December 2014, undercover police posted a message from Shannon McCoole’s account to the forum. “[Forum name redacted] is a living creature,” it said. “We have survived a lot of ups and downs. It’s been a passion of mine for a long time, and [forum name redacted] is bigger than ever. “Believe it or not, the board doesn’t run itself and requires a lot of thankless hours from the admins,   and mods. So the board will go into maintenance mode till the new year to give the admin team time to a break. “[It] will return in 2015 refreshed and better than ever. ” After six months running the forum  —   gathering enough evidence to prosecute hundreds and rescue 85 victims  —   police were pulling the plug on site. For months before, as evidence was disseminated around the world, the most significant users were being picked off by police. “Some of [the users] put it together before we closed the board,” Griffiths recalls. “People noticed people were disappearing. It’s an occupational hazard, and they usually assume when someone disappears they’ve been arrested. But when it keeps happening and happening, they start putting two and two together. ” Users even began approaching McCoole’s account with worries the police had infiltrated the site. Once they realised the forum wasn’t returning, and news finally emerged of McCoole’s arrest, some even offered grudging compliments. “One guy posted something along the lines of, ‘Kudos. I chatted to McCoole for six months and didn’t realise it was the cops’,” Griffiths says. Two Argos officers received awards for so seamlessly assuming McCoole’s identity for six months on the board. Last month, Richard Huckle was sentenced to a minimum 23 years’ jail. Shannon McCoole is serving 35 years. A blue line has been struck through both their names on the   list above Griffiths’ desk. More than two dozen others were crossed off the whiteboard by the time that particular investigation was closed. Eight remain.": "156904",
    "Yum Brands Inc’s ( ) U. S. KFC chain plans to curb the use of antibiotics in its chicken supply, making it the last of the big three chicken restaurants to join the fight against the rise of dangerous   bacteria known as superbugs. KFC, the   U. S. chicken chain by sales after privately held    is giving its U. S. poultry suppliers until the end of 2018 to stop using antibiotics important to human medicine.  Some 70 percent of antibiotics vital for fighting infections in humans are sold for use in meat and dairy production and medical researchers have concerns that overuse of those drugs may diminish their effectiveness in fighting disease in humans. McDonald’s Corp’s ( ) roughly 14, 000 U. S. restaurants last year stopped serving chicken raised with antibiotics considered important to human medicine. Its Chicken McNuggets are a top seller and the change put pressure on the rest of the industry to follow.    is going a step further, vowing in 2014 to switch to poultry raised without any antibiotics at all by the end of 2019. Given its stature, KFC had been the focus of several antibiotic reduction campaigns by consumer, health and environment groups in addition to a coalition of British and U. S. shareholders with more than $2 trillion in assets under management. ”We recognize that it’s a growing public health concern,”   KFC U. S. President Kevin Hochman told Reuters on Thursday.  ”This is something that’s important to many of our customers and it’s something we need to do to show relevance and modernity within our brand,” Hochman said.  The policy applies only to KFC in the United States and its 4, 200 restaurants supplied by some 2, 000 domestic chicken farms, said Hochman. KFC’s antibiotic policy is set on a    basis, he added. Yum spun off its   China division in November.  ’GREAT NEWS FOR FRIED CHICKEN LOVERS’ Vijay Sukumar, chief food innovation officer for KFC U. S. said the new policy applies throughout the bird’s full life cycle, which includes the hatchery where chicks are sometimes injected with antibiotics while still in the shell.  Using data from a 2017 WATT PoultryUSA survey, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) estimates that more than 42 percent of the U. S. chicken industry is either under an antibiotics stewardship pledge or has already converted to responsible practices.  KFC’s new policy will likely move the number even higher, said Lena Brook, a food policy advocate at the NRDC, who noted that the estimate includes ”raised without antibiotics” pledges as well as ”raised without medically important” antibiotics pledges from producers like Tyson Foods Inc ( ) Perdue Farms and others. ”It’s great news for fried chicken lovers, and most importantly it’s great news for public health,” Brook said. ”Their commitment is one that we’ve been waiting for.”  Human infections from   bacteria pose a grave threat to global health and are estimated to kill at least 23, 000 Americans each year, although a recent Reuters investigation found that many   deaths are going uncounted. Hochman said the policy change has been in the works for a year. It will add some incremental cost that KFC plans to manage rather than pass on in the form of menu price increases, he said. At least some of KFC suppliers are already well on their way to compliance.  Tyson, the largest U. S. poultry producer and a KFC supplier, has announced plans to eliminate the use of human antibiotics in its chicken flocks by September 2017. Yum’s Taco Bell chain already committed to serve chicken raised without antibiotics important to human medicine in all U. S. restaurants by the end of last month. Its Pizza Hut division has the same rules for pizza toppings.

    "A house on the U. S.  border in the Rio Grande Valley, near Rio Grande City, Tex. in August 1936. (Dorothea   of Congress)  The border between the United States and Mexico has been in the headlines for a while now. From issues of immigration to executive orders to tariffs to the animals that live along the nearly    boundary, it is not only one of the   international borders in the world, but one of the most heavily   areas. But the border itself is hardly new. The boundary was established in 1848 after the U. S   War ended with the Treaty of  . But it wasn’t until the turn of the 20th century that Mexico’s own revolution and subsequent border wars, followed by the Great Depression, prompted the United States to send soldiers, push Mexicans out of the country and strongly enforce its southern border. In 1924, Congress passed the Labor Appropriation Act, officially establishing the U. S. Border Patrol for the purpose of securing the borders between inspection stations. And in 1934, the first Border Patrol Academy opened as a training school in El Paso. In her book “Line in the Sand: A History of the Western U. S.  Border,” Rachel St. John writes that today’s border apparatus stems from the 1930s. At that time, Dorothea Lange, a Farm Security Administration photographer best known for her iconic Migrant Mother image, visited the border near El Paso. Given that the United States at that time was poorer than Mexico today, Lange’s photos have a familiar air about them. The inspection of goods. The impatience and eagerness of waiting. The anticipation of opportunity. The determination. Lange’s images, while uniquely of their time, capture both the recognizable signs of bureaucracy and the timelessness of life on the periphery.

The message is meant to encourage the “dear members of Congress,” the entertainers say, to “vigorously oppose” Trump’s “racist, sexist,           policies. ” “The majority of Americans, regardless of who they voted for, did not vote for racism, for sexism, or for xenophobia.

    "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is on his soapbox again. I implore everyone to ignore him. His message could be hazardous to your health. The lawyer, environmentalist and leading   crackpot, 63, who has compared widespread inoculations to “a holocaust,’’ threw a news conference Wednesday at The National Press Club in Washington, DC, that one top   expert described to me as “depressing. ’’ Appearing alongside Hollywood heavyweight Robert De Niro, 73, who has an autistic son, and other vaccine skeptics, he issued a $100, 000 challenge: Anyone who produces a   scientific study (at least one that RFK Jr. & Co. accept) proving that mercury in shots is safe for humans wins the hefty cash prize from Kennedy’s World Mercury Project. “On one hand, the government is telling pregnant women which   fish to avoid so that they don’t harm their fetuses, and on the other, the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] supports injecting   vaccines into pregnant women, infants and children,” said Kennedy, son of slain New York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of slain President John F. Kennedy. “This defies all logic and common sense. ” Kennedy claims to be  . Seriously. Yet he’s advancing the discredited theory that the shots cause autism and other neurological disorders by dangling money, with which he appears to have no intention of parting. This showboating marks a tragic new low in the health wars, according to Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “Vaccines are a victim of their own success,’’ said Offit. “People aren’t afraid of the diseases. They don’t see them. ’’ But they’re coming back. Measles, which claimed some 500 American lives annually before it was considered eradicated in the US in 2000, has returned, and there have been clusters of such similarly preventable illnesses as rubella, whooping cough and chicken pox. “There were 5, 100 cases of mumps last year,’’ Offit said  —   mentioning a disease about which I’d forgotten. He noted that mumps can cause “deafness in children and sterility in older people. ’’ Kennedy took aim at the   preservative thimerosal, which drug manufacturers removed from childhood vaccines out of an abundance of caution by 2001, but which is still used in some flu vaccines. Kennedy says it’s being given to “millions’’ of people, and alleges the paranoid theory that the government colluded with Big Pharma to put them at risk. Offit told me a person absorbs more mercury and other toxins by walking the streets of, say, New York City than from inoculations. Yet growing numbers of parents across the country, at least some of them freaked out by the misinformation, have found ways to opt out their kids from getting vaccinated. Less than 1 percent of incoming public and private school kids in New York state received religious or health exemptions from vaccines in the   academic year, according to Department of Health figures. But in   New Jersey, health officials sounded the alarm after parents of about 1. 9 percent of schoolchildren, and growing, failed to get their kids inoculated last school year, citing religious or medical reasons. Guardians of public health fear this could soon threaten the “herd immunity’’ that protects the unvaccinated, but requires that 90 to 95 percent of the population has shots. The   world, which should include all of us, has other worries. Kennedy on Wednesday said President Trump, who met with him Jan. 10, and members of his administration are still   on vaccine safety. (After Kennedy announced last month that he would chair it, a transition team spokeswoman said “no decisions have been made’’ about forming such a commission.) “What I’ve seen is that you put these massive injections at one time into a   baby. I’ve seen children who were 100 percent normal and become totally autistic,” Trump told me in 2015, saying he wants doctors to space out smaller injections over about two years. Physicians warn that could put children at risk for disease. Rejecting the gospel of RFK Jr. is the best way to achieve good health. Do it! Ever since    Etan Patz vanished while walking alone, for the first time, to his New York City school bus stop in 1979, most adults never again left their kids unwatched. Former bodega clerk Pedro Hernandez, 56, was    —   but not the top count of intentional murder. His lawyer vowed to appeal the verdict that could see him locked up for life. Let’s hope the convictions bring some peace to Etan’s family, as well as to folks in the city and beyond. Everyone whose lives have been changed forever by this little boy lost. Here he is  —   the American Boy doll. After 31 years of selling hunks of plastic in female form, American Girl this week   named Logan Everett, who plays drums in the band of a new girl doll, Tenney Grant. American Girl, now owned by Mattel Inc. has won kudos for introducing historical figures, such as a   doll, and criticism from me and others for veering into   with a “homeless’’ doll who lived in a car with her mom. But retailing at $115 apiece  —   not including extra clothes, accessories, even hairstyling done at American Girl stores  —   the price may drive away consumers.

    "The White House Correspondents’ Association dinner is not a mood ring. It doesn’t care if President Trump  —   or any president  —   likes, dislikes, celebrates, scorns or ignores White House reporters. The annual gala does not indicate, illustrate or represent the relationship between the White House and the reporters who cover it. It is an institution that celebrates one bedrock American value, the First Amendment, and two journalistic goals: to highlight excellent reporting and to award scholarships to the next generation of American journalists. That has always been true. But the Trump presidency has inspired some in the press corps to boycott this year because  —   if I have this right  —   reporters are too good for Trump. When asked why his outlet won’t be   its always   WHCA dinner   this year (and why he says he’s going fishing instead) Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter told the New York Times that his reasons were “Trump” and “the fish. ” The New Yorker is scrapping its own, very popular, correspondents’ dinner weekend kickoff party, as well. U. S. News & World Report’s Robert Schlesinger says “The media should go all the way and boycott the dinner entirely this year. ” Of Trump, The Washington Post’s Margaret Sullivan argues that it’s time to cancel the event because the press should not “be his prom date. ” But no   White House reporter has ever been a president’s prom date, and the dinner isn’t a date at all. It’s a   with bad wine and crowded tables. And if we, the media, stand Trump up at the proverbial dance because we’re pining for another “date,” we make it that much easier for him to say we’re playing favorites. And in this case, at least, he’d be right. The WHCA already has to defend itself against the “nerd prom” cliche  —   two hours of live TV every spring during which   and   journalists allegedly do nothing more than mingle with   celebrities. After that, so goes the tedious trope, reporters bow down before sources as supplicants. Never mind that the vast majority of WHCA members don’t receive an invitation to the dinner or the various receptions that take place before and after. Never mind that reporters, like everyone else, are capable of doing some work while dressed up and laughing at the hired comic or the president of the United States.   [I sat next to Donald Trump at the infamous 2011 White House correspondents’ dinner]   Consistency matters. The New York Times, among other organizations, has for several years chosen to ignore the dinner. Fair enough. Reasonable journalists can disagree. The suggestion, though, that holding the dinner during the Trump era would be an act of debasement, or that the advent of the Trump administration is the right moment to do away with the event altogether, strikes me as precisely the wrong approach. My outlet, CBS News, will participate this year and proudly so. If they back out now, organizations that attended last year ought to explain what is different about this year. Is it Trump? Or is it them? Skipping needlessly hands an evidentiary cudgel to Trump and his acolytes that reporters cannot and will not cover his presidency objectively. Yes, it might strike some as unseemly for reporters to attend a banquet where the keynote speaker is a president who calls the press “dishonest” purveyors of “fake news. ” But it would be even more unseemly, given our role, if we signaled to our readers, viewers and listeners that it is beneath us to pay Trump the same institutional respect extended to previous presidents. Besides, Trump is hardly the first president to see the press as his enemy. Other presidents have at times demonstrated contempt for journalists, limited our access, circumvented us and questioned our motives. I’ve covered three of them. Holding the dinner does not confer respect on any president. It aligns one institution, the WHCA, with another, the American presidency. If the dinner were canceled because (gasp!) a president made a few snide remarks about White House reporters, that act of   would say that the First Amendment is negotiable and that emotional   takes precedence over professional responsibilities. For myself and for my colleagues on the beat, let me say unequivocally: never. Let’s remember, finally, why we hold the dinner: The WHCA, backed by the Bill of Rights, fights daily for access to the most powerful figure in American politics  —   and thereby, the association hopes, encouraging reporters in state capitols, county commission offices and city halls to do the same. Events built around the dinner allow collegiate scholarship winners to ask questions of seasoned members of the White House press corps, learning from some of the best about how they might be better reporters, storytellers and writers. In my experience, interacting with these energetic, optimistic and creative souls has consistently revived my hopes for the craft of journalism and the durability of a free press. This was vital to me early in my career as a Washington reporter, and now I see it as a chance to give back. If Trump represents a genuine threat to press freedoms, then foregoing the dinner doesn’t change a thing. The right response, instead, is for reporters and news organizations to redouble their commitment to a WHCA dinner built around the journalism of the present and of the future.": "205143",
    "Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump by seven points in Michigan, a battleground state both presidential candidates are eager to win in order to clinch 270 college electoral votes and the White House in November. A Suffolk University poll released Thursday shows Clinton is ahead of Trump in the Great Lake State by a 44% to 37% margin. Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson appears to have less appeal among likely voters compared to others in states around the country, with only 5% of respondents saying they would back him. Jill Stein, the Green Party’s nominee, only garnered support from 3% of those surveyed. Ten percent told researchers they were still undecided. Polls: Tight in North Carolina while Trump tops in Arizona, This latest poll solidifies Michigan’s support for Clinton after Bernie Sanders won the Democratic primary with 49. 7% of the vote March 8.  The numbers are a positive sign for Clinton in a state that handily elected President Barack Obama in 2008 with 57% of the vote before returning him to the White House by 54% in 2012. But the poll also found the Clinton campaign still had work to do to improve their principal’s favorability ratings, with just 28% of respondents saying they thought Clinton was honest and trustworthy in contrast to 63% who did not. Trump engendered similarly negative responses, with a 35% trustworthy to 53% untrustworthy breakdown. Poll: Clinton up big on Trump in Virginia, The key issue on the minds of those polled were jobs and the economy (21%) followed closely by terrorism and national security (20%) and potential Supreme Court nominees (11%). Interestingly, when asked about their feelings towards the upcoming presidential election, 61% of respondents said they were alarmed by the state of the race. Eleven percent said they were ”bored,” while only 20% felt excited about casting a ballot on November 8. The Suffolk University poll surveyed 500 likely voters in Michigan over the telephone between August 22 and 24. Its findings have a margin of error of 4. 4 percentage points.": "57212",
    "Mary Keitany, a    mother of two, went out for a run on Sunday morning. She started at the foot of the   Bridge on Staten Island and worked her way through the city. About 10 miles into her run, in South Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Keitany picked up the pace, the first signal to those running with her that she was not in the mood for a group run. She soon surged again, effectively saying, “Goodbye, everyone I’ll see you at brunch. ” It was no ordinary weekend run. Keitany, a marathon dynamo who trains at 7, 500 feet in Kenya’s western highlands, put on a virtuoso solo performance that is uncommon for the streets of New York. It resulted in her third consecutive New York City Marathon title. She was so far in front of her competitors that she could have taken a stroll through the Sheep Meadow in Central Park on her way to the finish line. Instead, Keitany took the most direct path, at a punishing pace that no one else could maintain, her      body gliding along for 26. 2 miles without any apparent struggle. Keitany finished in 2 hours 24 minutes 26 seconds, with the   finisher nowhere in sight. “I was not planning to do this, but I had a time I wanted to run, and I needed to keep the pace,” Keitany said of her breakaway. “I’ve run alone many times, and I trained well. And if anyone caught me, I was going to chase them. ” A    from Eritrea, Ghirmay Ghebreslassie, won the men’s race. He emerged from a tight pack of three at Mile 20 and blew kisses at onlookers as he won in 2:07:51. He is the youngest winner in race history. Ghebreslassie, who won the world championship in Beijing in 2015 at 19, took fourth place in the Rio Olympics. He was followed Sunday by Lucas Rotich of Kenya (2:08:53). Abdi Abdirahman, a      who is based in Arizona, finished in third (2:11:23). Keitany’s unexpected break from the lead pack threw the women’s race into early upheaval as her competitors stretched out one by one along the course, jockeying for the remaining two podium spots. Sally Kipyego of Kenya, the 2012 Olympic silver medalist in the 10, 000 meters, placed second in 2:28:01, more than three and a half minutes behind Keitany, and Molly Huddle of the United States, in her marathon debut, was third in 2:28:13. Keitany’s push so early in the race seemed to wreak mental havoc on her competitors, who were forced to either try to keep up or hope that she could be caught later. “On the breakaway, I had to decide if I go or stay,” Huddle said. “I kind of went a little harder around Mile 8 and was alone for a while. Then slowed down a little bit too much on the bridge at Mile 15, and I think that just  —   I need to measure myself a little better. ” Huddle held back, but that meant Keitany’s lead would grow. Joyce Chepkirui, also from Kenya, chose to follow. But that proved fatal she was unable to sustain the pace and fell back before the halfway mark. Overtaken by Huddle, she faded to fourth. Taking off alone is a risky move, particularly early in a race, when a chase pack has more than an hour to band together in pursuit. In this case, Keitany’s strategy led to the largest margin of victory in the woman’s race  —   3 minutes 34. 98 seconds  —   since Grete Waitz won in 1980. Breakaways in this marathon are common, but early ones can ruin a   as often as they carry her to victory. Many make their moves at Mile 16 when they have safely cleared the Queensboro Bridge and are in Manhattan  —   and they are often overtaken in wild chases through the final miles of Central Park. In 2000, Abdelkhader   of Morocco ran away from the Kenyans chasing him far earlier than he was supposed to, leaving even the pacesetter behind and causing an upset. And in 1988, Steve Jones of Britain ran alone to set the fastest time in seven years, with a 3:21 margin of victory that almost rivaled Keitany’s. Meb Keflezighi, then 38, used the tactic in the 2014 Boston Marathon, when at Mile 11 he eluded a formidable field of younger athletes who figured the aging Keflezighi would fade back. Other Americans, including Ryan Hall, said they realized Keflezighi had an opportunity to win and slowed the pace of the chase pack. By the time his younger, fitter rivals realized his lead was insurmountable, it was too late. Keflezighi became the first American to win the race since 1983. Frank Shorter pulled away just beyond nine miles to take gold in the 1972 Munich Olympics. And at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, Joan Benoit Samuelson took the lead early on as well, at Mile 3 in the first Olympic women’s marathon, heading to her historic victory. “I tell people all the time, you need to run your own race,” Benoit said Sunday. “That’s what Mary did if you play into somebody else’s hands, especially early on, it can foul your plans. ” Benoit’s decision to take the lead was spontaneous. “I didn’t want to take the lead that early, but I knew what I was capable of running, and I went with it,” she said. “You’ve got to go with what you know. ” It has grown less common for women to risk taking off alone in the New York City Marathon, especially after the race switched to the separate start for the women’s professional field in 2002. In a pack, runners can take turns keeping a pace and blocking headwinds. But running together often leaves the race decided by decisive breakaways in the final miles. So if a marathoner is confident that she can maintain the pace while running alone, absorbing all of the wind, she might try to break away from the pack early to avoid a tactical sprint near the finish. In the 2011 New York City Marathon, Keitany broke away but was overtaken by two Ethiopians who steadily reeled her in. Buzunesh Deba of Ethiopia, who lives in the Bronx, ran nearly the entire course minutes ahead of the rest of the professional field with her friend and teammate Tigist Tufa through bracing wind in 2013 before Priscah Jeptoo of Kenya caught her in Central Park. Deba finished second. Keitany said she did not plan to challenge the field so assertively. But of the women on the podium, she was the only one who had completed a marathon before Sunday. Kipyego, who dropped out of this race last year, said: “I wanted to run within myself and stick to something that I felt was more conservative. I kind of came in thinking that I’d rather run a much more conservative race, hold something back, and be able to have a good experience just because this a new distance for me. ” Huddle agreed. “I was kind of just surviving at the end and looking ahead and really trying to catch Joyce and trying to catch Sally, but you were too fast,” Huddle said to Kipyego. “So just kind of flailing the last 10K probably, well, probably the last 10 miles. ” Keitany became the first woman to win New York three times in a row since Waitz won five from 1982 to 1986. As her orange sneakers bounced steadily off the pavement through the five boroughs and into Central Park, Keitany showed that she had no problem running alone  —   provided she has a chance to start at all. Although she is the   woman in history and her country’s   (2:18:37) Kenya left her off its Olympic team this year. The snub left her to focus on her fall race. She chose to execute a bold maneuver against a weak field, vacated by those who had already spent themselves at the Olympics in August or at other fall marathons. Keitany acknowledged the risk in her race strategy Sunday. “Sometimes if you break off and you’re not ready to follow through, they will catch you,” she said. “But I was ready. ”": "24309",
    "The corporate owner of Sears and Kmart said on Tuesday that there was “substantial doubt” that it could continue operating, as    stores continue to face challenges in an   world. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the corporate owner, Sears Holdings Corporation, cited its efforts to cut costs, sell property, tap new funding sources and make other moves to stanch the flow of red ink. Still, it reported a $2. 2 billion loss for last year and said it had to use money from its investments and financing activities to fund operations. “Our historical operating results indicate substantial doubt exists related to the company’s ability to continue as a going concern,” it said in the filing, its annual report. The disclosure is a setback for the company and for Edward S. Lampert, the hedge fund manager who engineered the combination of the two legends of American retail 13 years ago. Mr. Lampert has shut down stores, reshuffled the company’s organization and pushed to have a greater online presence. Still, Sears Holdings has lost more than $5 billion over the last three years as sales have declined. On Wednesday morning, in the first day of trading after the disclosure, shares in the company tumbled more than 13 percent. Sears, through its catalog, has been a fixture of American homes for more than a century. Kmart, which has its own lengthy history beginning as a    store in Detroit, became a major national presence in the 1960s as a   department store, with Blue Light Special discounts geared toward     Americans. But both brands were squeezed by Walmart Stores, with its heavy discounts, and Target, which sold affordable goods but with more design and flair. Both Sears and Kmart also suffered because they were in older shopping malls and neighborhoods. Online retailing, with the rise of the likes of Amazon, presented a more recent challenge. To cope, Sears Holdings has been shrinking. This month, it sold its Craftsman tool brand to Stanley Black  Decker in a deal valued at more than $775 million. Still, its   debt as of January totaled nearly $4. 2 billion, almost double from the same period the previous year, according to the filing. In February, Sears Holdings said it had started a restructuring program that it said would save $1 billion annually. The plan focuses on streamlining   corporate and support functions, tweaking product offerings and supply chain and looking for ways to reshuffle real estate. As of January, Sears Holdings said, it had 1, 430 Sears and Kmart stores in the United States. By contrast, a decade ago it had about 3, 800 stores in the United States and Canada.": "19509",
    "Louis Casanova is playing cards with a friend on the back deck of a recovery house in Philadelphia’s northern suburbs. He’s warm and open as he talks about his past few years. The guy everyone calls Louie started using drugs like Xanax and Valium during his freshman year of high school. At age 18, Casanova turned to heroin. About two years later, the rehab shuffle began. ”I relapsed and then I was just getting high. And then I went to treatment again in February of 2015,” he says. ”Then I relapsed again and went back to treatment.” He’s 23 now. He’s hurt people close to him and his criminal record, fueled by his drug addiction, is long. By Louie’s count, he has been through eight inpatient rehabs. Louis says his stays have ranged from about 18 to 45 days. ”I did 30 days, and after that I came here,” he concludes, talking about his latest visit. A month’s stay can be pretty typical among people who go to an inpatient facility. But why? ”As far as I know, there’s nothing magical about 28 days,” says Kimberly Johnson, director of the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment at SAMHSA, the federal agency that studies treatment services. Anne Fletcher, author of the book Inside Rehab, agrees. ”It certainly is not scientifically based,” she says. ”I live in Minnesota where the model was developed and a lot of treatment across the country really stemmed from that.” She says the late Daniel Anderson was one of the primary architects of the ”Minnesota model,” which became the prevailing treatment protocol for addiction specialists. At a state hospital in Minnesota in the 1950s, Anderson saw alcoholics living in locked wards, leaving only to be put to work on a farm. To find a path for them to get sober and leave the hospital, he came up with the   model. Marvin Ventrell, executive director of the National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers, has studied the model’s history. He says the   standard comes from the notion that when ”someone is suffering from addiction  —   and in the days that this began, we’re pretty much talking about alcoholism  —   it made sense to people that it took about four weeks to stabilize somebody.” And then, Ventrell says, ”It became the norm because the insurance industry was willing to pay for that period of time.” Now the model has spread to treatment for opioid addiction, even though recovering from addiction to those powerful drugs may require a different method. Ventrell admits there isn’t enough research about the most effective length for an inpatient stay for opioid addiction. ”Treatment centers have to step up and say, ’Just like cancer or heart disease, we’re going to measure our outcomes and show them to you,’ ” he says. The federal government estimates spending on treatment for all substance abuse will hit a high of $42 billion by 2020. Some people pay tens of thousands of dollars, desperately hoping inpatient treatment will work. But there’s increasing evidence that medication assisted treatment with the synthetic opioids methadone or suboxone can help those addicted by helping to relieve symptoms of withdrawal and reduce craving, especially when paired with strong outpatient counseling and other support. Fletcher says it’s important for treatment to move away from the default   model. That may be enough for some people, she says, but it ”isn’t the case for most people. It’s like any other chronic disorder, it waxes and wanes.”  After his inpatient stays, Casanova is still trying to break his addiction. While he says recovery largely depends on the person, he preferred longer stays because it gave him more time to learn from other patients in a supportive environment. But Casanova is just one person others prefer inpatient stays that are shorter than a month, followed by intensive outpatient programs. Casanova relapsed in February, before I talked to him, and recently had to serve some jail time. But he’s back in the recovery house, and hoping to soon make the leap to the next stage  —   a house with even more independence.

    "Warnings  —   or, in some cases, celebrations  —   that the Democrats are on the verge of a disastrous collapse have been growing more frequent recently. [Since the election, Rush Limbaugh has been hammering the point that the campaign has only continued  —   and extended the trend set in 2010, when Democrats lost the House.   Since then, Democrats have lost 1200 national and statewide seats. And earlier this week, Stewart Lawrence, writing in the Daily Caller, and picking up on a study by the centrist “Third Way” think tank, noted that the Democrats are now almost exclusively a coastal party, with a couple of lone interior outposts such as Chicago and Minneapolis.  According to the study, while Hillary Clinton beat Trump in California, New York and Massachusetts by 30% Trump won the rest of the states by  %.  Some 32 state legislatures are in Republican hands, but in only five states do Democrats control both houses of the legislature and the governor’s mansion. And, as many (including Lawrence) note, in 2018 the Democrats must defend 10 U. S. Senate seats in states that Trump won.  Meanwhile, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, once thought dead in the water, won   in 2016, as did John McCain in Arizona, despite the fact that many conservatives, sick of his antics, voted for the Democrat. If the left can’t win these seats  —   the most   of fruit  —   where can they win? The fact is, although we now know the polls were horribly wrong, Trump’s victory was quite small compared to what it might have been. Consider: Trump lost these seven states by a total of 510, 000 votes  —   shifting 51 electoral votes and narrowly denying him a massive landslide territory. The “flip factor”  —   what is needed to reverse the decision  —   was a mere 260, 000 votes. Trump gained 290, 000 votes more than Romney in Pennsylvania alone between 2012 and 2016. In short, the fake news media is missing a much larger story: that the Democrats are teetering on the edge of an abyss that could see them utterly wiped out in 2018 and 2020.

    "On the 2016 campaign trail, Donald Trump has insisted that he is worth more than $10bn. However, a statement filed to the Securities and Exchange Commission by Wells Fargo Securities on Trump’s behalf in 2012 indicated that the real estate developer was then worth less than half that, with comparatively few of the liquid assets that may now finance his campaign for president. In the document, which concerned the securitization of commercial mortgages on properties including Trump Tower in New York City, Trump was described as being worth more than $4. 2bn, with liquid assets of more than $250m.  A passage in the   filing says: “The sponsor is Donald J Trump. Mr Trump has significant commercial real estate holdings worldwide including interests in office, retail, residential,   and hospitality properties in markets including New York, San Francisco, Florida, Washington DC, and Scotland. As of 30 June 2011, Mr Trump reports a net worth in excess of $4. 2bn and liquidity in excess of $250m. ” The Trump campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  Jessica Ong, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo, insisted the 2012 filing was correct.  She said: “Obviously, if it was inaccurate, we wouldn’t have filed it with the SEC. ” While $250m is a large amount of money, it is nowhere near enough to finance a modern presidential campaign. Trump has already loaned between $43m and $50m to his campaign, raising questions about how much he can afford to continue to spend without selling off assets or taking on significant loans.  Trump has insisted that he has far more than $250m in liquid assets, last year telling Fox News anchor Sean Hannity he had $400m, all of which he was prepared to use. In sworn testimony for a 2007 lawsuit, deposition transcripts show, Trump was asked by a lawyer whether he had “ever exaggerated in statements about your properties?” “I think everyone does,” Trump answered. The lawyer pressed: “Does that mean that sometimes you’ll inflate the value of your properties in your statements?” “Not beyond reason,” Trump said. Trump’s claim to be able to   his campaign has been a foundation of his   successful claim to be independent of the Washington establishment. Although he is now frantically building a fundraising apparatus, he has insisted this is simply to help the Republican National Committee (RNC) raise money for the party as a whole. His campaign reported only $1. 3m “cash on hand” to begin the month of June, in contrast to Hillary Clinton’s $42. 5m. The RNC has not seemed overly concerned. Speaking to CNN in June, the group’s chief strategist, Sean Spicer, said that if Trump “wanted to get that [fundraising] number up in two seconds, he just strokes a check and it’s up”. The Trump campaign has insisted that the businessman has converted his loan into a donation. No such paperwork has yet been filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC).  The 2012 SEC filing contradicts a claim made by Trump in November 2011, in which he said he had a net worth of more than $7bn and insisted that he derived almost $3bn from the value of his personal brand. In May 2016, Trump filed a statement with the FEC in which he insisted his “net worth is in excess of $10bn”. The disclosure indicated that he had taken on at least $50m in debt and sold off assets in the past year. While the statement from Wells Fargo indicates that Trump may be far less wealthy than he claims, it would also indicate that he is in better financial shape than many financial experts believe, unless he has suffered significant undisclosed financial losses in recent years.  Fortune magazine has estimated that Trump is currently worth $3. 9bn in 2015, Bloomberg News assessed Trump’s fortune at $2. 9bn.  Another billionaire, Mark Cuban, has scoffed at Trump’s claims, suggesting the presumptive Republican nominee may not be a billionaire at all. Cuban’s reading of Trump’s most recent financial disclosure was that Trump may only have $165m available.": "151983",
    "Liberals are ecstatic that a judge in Hawaii is writing immigration policy for the entire country, and that policy is: We have no right to tell anyone that he can’t live in America. (Unless they’re Christians  —   those guys we can keep out. )[As subtly alluded to in the subtitle of Adios, America: The Left’s Plan to Turn Our Country into a Third World Hellhole, the goal of liberals is for the poor of the world to have a constitutional right to come here whenever they want.  I can’t help but notice that the Third Worlders aren’t moving to liberals’ neighborhoods. After nearly 1 million Rwandans were murdered by other Rwandans in 1994, our government asked itself: Why not bring more of this fascinating Rwandan culture to America? Ten thousand of them poured in. So far, nearly 400 have been convicted in the United States of lying on visa applications about their role in the genocide. And that’s why we have to tighten our belt, America! Massive international investigations don’t come cheap. Almost every immigration case is a con, something we find out every time there’s a San Bernardino shooting and half the familyturns out to have scammed our immigration officials. One hundred percent of the “humanitarian” cases are frauds. Earlier this month, Rwanda’s Gervais Ngombwa was convicted for lying on his immigration application by claiming to have been a victim of the 1994 genocide. In fact, he was a   perpetrator  —   even featured in Rwandan newspaper articles as a leader of the genocide. For most of the last two decades, Ngombwa has been living in Iowa with his wife and eight children in a house built by Habitat for Humanity  —   because no Americans need houses. He came to the authorities’ attention a couple years ago by setting that house on fire after a domestic dispute, then filing a fraudulent $75, 000 insurance claim. Another Rwandan genocidalist living in America was featured in Adios, America: Beatrice Munyenyezi, granted refugee status as an alleged victim of the genocide, even though she, too, had helped orchestrate it. Munyenyezi was living safely living in Kenya when she applied for a refugee visa to America. The welfare is way better here. And, luckily for us, she had a “chronic medical condition” that required constant attention from a New Hampshire hospital. Hesham Mohamed Hadayet arrived in the U. S. on a tourist visa, then immediately applied for “asylum” on the grounds that he was persecuted in Egypt  —   for being a member of an Islamic terrorist group. Being a member of a noted terrorist group cannot be used to block you from coming to America, thanks to Barney Frank’s 1989 amendment to the Immigration and Naturalization Act, because liberals love this country so very, very much. Being a talented neurosurgeon from Switzerland, however, is disqualifying. Hadayet’s refugee application wasn’t denied until he’d already been living here for three years. When he was called in for a visa overstay hearing, he didn’t show up, and the INS didn’t bother looking for him. After allowing Hadayet to mill about America for another year, our government granted him permanent residency and a work permit. On the Fourth of July following the   attack, Hadayet shot up the El Al ticket counter at the Los Angeles International Airport. I guess the Egyptians were right! As bodies were being cleared away from the ticket counter, including Hadayet’s, his wife blamed America for the attack, denying her husband had anything to do with it. “He is a victim of injustice,” she explained. “In America, they hate Islam and Arabs after Sept. 11. ” At least immigrants are grateful. Immigration bureaucrats are so determined to transform America without anyone seeing what they’re doing that the INS initially refused to release Hadayet’s file to congressional investigators, in order to protect his “privacy. ” Of course, anybody could miss Egypt’s designating someone a terrorist. And maybe the INS’s test for Rwandan “refugees” is: Would this person be able to convince Rolling Stone magazine that “Haven Monahan” raped her? How about Rasmea Yousef Odeh? She waltzed into America after having been convicted and imprisoned in Israel for a supermarket bombing that left two Hebrew University students dead, and also for the attempted bombing of the British consulate in Israel. She was released in a prisoner exchange  —   whereupon Odeh made a beeline for the U. S. True, Odeh wasn’t subjected to the   vetting accorded the humanitarian cases, like the Boston Marathon bombers (we were warned by Russia) Hadayet (we were warned by Egypt) or the Blind Sheik (same). But how did our immigration authorities miss a CONVICTION FOR BOMBING IN ISRAEL? Apart from the terrorism, welfare, and fraud, what great things did any of them do for our country? Ngombwa was a custodian at the Cedar Rapids Community School District in Iowa, a job that, evidently, no American would do. Munyenyezi had a job as an advocate for refugees  —   just one of the many jobs being created by immigrants. Hadayet ran a failing limousine company and was $10, 000 in debt. Odeh was an unemployed waitress and a Palestinian grievance activist. Recently, she’s been heavily involved in     male protests, because who doesn’t like incessant Third World unrest?

    "Ok, so that’s what an establishment looks like. It’s hard to remember a time when the two parties offered greater contrasts in discipline, manipulation, and sheer Machiavellian grit than they do right now. As Hillary Clinton basks in the glow of her historic “first,” it’s worth recalling just some of the establishment   that dragged her across the finish line. Even then, she almost lost. When the road got dark, the establishment lit her way. Superdelegates put Sanders in a hole from the beginning, leading to countless discouraging stories about his nearly impossible task. She was saved from a humiliating Iowa caucus loss in an opaque process featuring (and I’m not making this up) multiple coin flips and run in part by a party chair who drove a car featuring an “HRC 2016″ license plate. Debates were few, far between, and scheduled at odd days and hours. I   one to pop up after a 2:30 a. m. rerun of “Judge Joe Brown. ” In the pièce de résistance, the AP announced  —   on the eve of the hotly contested California primary  —   that the combination of elected delegates and those nefarious superdelegates had put Clinton over the top: The Democratic establishment had succeeded in nominating a corrupt candidate who may be the only Democrat in America who could lose to Donald Trump. The Republican establishment, which is commonly viewed as a malevolent, controlling entity with the power to “force” unpopular candidates on Republican voters, has emerged from this primary season looking downright hapless by comparison. Its first and perhaps most strategically damaging sin was an utter lack of the   Democrats marshalled. In the contest between ambition and restraint, ambition won again and again  —   until the Republican debate stage was overflowing with hopeless candidates, each of whom seemed to believe that the right combination of debate sound bites and stunning Fox News appearances would allow them to emerge from the scrum. Share article on FacebookshareTweet But it’s hard to catch fire when you’re scared. And for months, most of the candidates kept their heads down lest they suffer the same fate as Jeb Bush  —   a good man subjected to withering, petty   from Donald Trump. To the extent the Republican party actually did manipulate the process, it did so in the worst way  —   not by showing leadership and influencing the candidate recruitment process or by implementing rules that would require transparency and disclosure, but by stacking the deck for the   (whoever the   was) with absurd    and    primaries that allowed a candidate who sometimes lost more than 60 percent of the vote to take all or most of the delegates. It’s as if the RNC looked at the primaries of ’08 and ’12 and decided simply that “short” is better than “long”  —   regardless of the result. RELATED: Did #NeverTrump Have to Happen? But the worst was yet to come. Legions of grassroots conservatives had long complained that GOP leaders were unprincipled opportunists. Then, when the pitiful primary process yielded a nominee whose philosophy and core values contradicted virtually everything the GOP claimed to stand for, its leaders went ahead and proved that they were, in fact, unprincipled opportunists  —   falling over themselves to endorse Trump and then, inevitably, finding themselves squirming as they tried to defend the indefensible. The Democratic establishment led decisively, yet led badly, nominating the one person who might lose to Donald Trump the Republican establishment didn’t lead at all, and now it stands ready to nominate the one person most likely to lose to Hillary Clinton. More 2016 It’s Time to Move On from the 2016 ElectionHillary Blames America FirstHillary Says Voter Suppression Cost Her the ElectionIt’s a stunning turn of events, and it stands as enduring evidence of the failure of the American political elite.

While there are still chances for a better outcome, both establishments are poised to reap what they’ve sown and will now “lead” America through what is likely to be a period of strife and pain. Perhaps there will be a renewal on the other side of that reckoning, perhaps not. But for now, we only know the view from this side, and it is unworthy of the greatest nation on earth.,": "119525",
    "It is sometimes argued that the media should spend less time on President Trump’s transgressive tweets in order to devote more attention to real issues, such as North Korea. In fact, it is necessary to focus on Trump’s tweets precisely because they shed light on the mind that is doing the deciding on North Korea. It is a distasteful exercise. But we cannot look away. We need to know the state of mind we’re dealing with. Trump’s tweets reveal a leader who is compulsive, abusive and easily triggered. Trump describes all this as “modern day presidential. ” Lincoln had his Gettysburg Address. Franklin Roosevelt had his Four Freedoms. But modern schoolchildren will learn the Mika bloody   tweet. What we are witnessing is not a new age in presidential communications. It is an ongoing public breakdown. And the question naturally arises: Is this the result of mental dysfunction? Most psychiatrists are (understandably) uncomfortable with diagnosing from a distance. And the particular diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder requires significant impairment  —   which is a hard case to make of a figure at the pinnacle of American politics. And yet. There are judgments that must be made about the fitness of leaders. Citizens are under no ethical obligation to be silent when they see serious dysfunction. The challenge here is not merely the trashing of political norms. The main problem is the possibility that America has an unbalanced president during a period of   global testing. This is not a clinical diagnosis. It is a civic and political judgment, made necessary by the president’s own words and acts. Trump holds a job that requires, above all else, the ability to unite and steady the nation in a time of crisis. There is no reason to believe he can play that role. Much of the prudence and courage required to confront this problem will need to come from Republicans and conservatives. Where to start? How about refusing to play down revolting lunacy? It is not merely an “occasional ad hominem” for a president to employ the tremendous power of his office to target individual American citizens who oppose him. It is an abuse of power.  It is not merely “uncouth” for a president to tolerate, even to hint support for, violence against political opponents (“I’d like to punch him in the face”). It creates an atmosphere of intimidation. It is not merely “exaggeration” for a president to issue a series of   lies, including that his predecessor spied on him and that a   victory was denied to him by widespread electoral fraud. It indicates either a deep cynicism or a tenuous connection to reality. It is not being “coarse” for a president to engage in consistent misogyny. It is a sign of a disturbing and   dehumanization of women.  Many conservatives would respond to this critique by saying, “At least he fights!” The question is: For what? Trump evinces no strong or consistent policy views. He fights for himself  —   for admiration and adulation  —   which is the only cause his extreme narcissism allows. Many conservatives would also respond by saying, “At least he does conservative things!” But if health care is any indication, Trump lacks conviction, knowledge and the ability to persuade. Other than that, he is Ronald Reagan incarnate. Trump’s conservative defenders are attempting something extraordinary: to politically normalize abnormal psychology. Their sycophancy enables a sickness. What next? Applying the 25th Amendment (containing the procedure to remove an unfit president from office) is a practical impossibility, since it involves the Cabinet turning against the president. But House and Senate Republicans should be prepared to aggressively challenge unbalanced or unhinged presidential language and decisions, rather than trying to dismiss them as simply a “distraction. ” And responsible officials in the executive branch  —   particularly at the State, Defense and Justice departments and in the various intelligence services  —   may also need to provide an internal check on foolish, precipitous orders. The option here is to refuse, to defy, to resign (or be fired) and then to publicly provide the reasons. No one really knows how to deal with this situation, which still feels more like an unnerving political novel than our political reality. Trump has led our country into unexplored territory.

    "Former Atlanta Hawks center Pero Antic looks to be the biggest loser in a 1 Oak melee that resulted in two NBA players getting arrested in 2015. Antic, 34, now stands to get $0 in his lawsuit    —   well below his hopes for a $25 million payout. Trial in the   case pitting the 6′ ″ Antic against the police had been set to kick off on August 1st. Manhattan federal judge Jesse Furman didn’t explain why he tossed Antic’s lawsuit ahead of trial, saying only that he would explain his ruling “in a forthcoming opinion. ” But the judge hinted in the Wednesday court filing that he agreed with city lawyers who argued that Antic’s claims were bogus  —   in part because he was not harmed during his arrest. The 2015 melee at the center of the lawsuit began when   forward   who tried to intervene in an argument Copeland was having with a lady friend. That prompted the cops to force everyone to leave the Chelsea nightclub, including Antic and his former colleague, Hawks forward Thabo Sefolosha. Cops said Antic and Sefolosha were dragging their feet, prompting an officer to escort them to their SUV. Once outside the SUV, Sefolosha attempted to give a beggar money, prompting a nearby officer nearby think that Sefolosha was going after the officer who had escorted him to the car. They arrested Sefolosha. When Antic tried to intervene he, too, was arrested, court papers said. In April,   alleging false arrest and excessive force. Sefolosha said his arrest led to serious injuries, including a broken fibula and ligament damage, that forced him to sit out the remainder of the NBA regular season. City lawyer’s took a tougher stance on Antic’s claims, arguing that the cops “had ample probable cause to arrest” Antic because he tried to obstruct Sefolosha’s arrest. They also scoffed at Antic’s excessive force claim, arguing that he was not injured as a result of his arrest. Indeed, Antic’s 2016 lawsuit focuses more on the “reputational harm” he claims resulted from media coverage of his arrest rather than any specific physical injuries. Lawyers for Antic didn’t return a request for comment. “The court has notified us that the city’s effort to dismiss this suit was successful and that a decision would be issued at a later date,” a spokesman for the city’s Law Department told The Post.": "133550",
    "As Hillary Clinton began a meeting with police chiefs from departments around the country, she expressed gratitude to those on the force. ”They represent officers who get up every day, put on their uniforms, kiss their families goodbye and risk their lives on behalf of our communities,” the Democratic nominee said at the Thursday gathering in New York City. During the brief part of the meeting that was open to reporters, Clinton referenced Dallas, where five police officers were shot and killed in July. She also talked about Baton Rouge, La. where police fatally shot Alton Sterling, a    black man, while he was on the ground. Clinton said there’s a lot of work to do to repair trust between communities and police. ”We need to work together to bridge our divides, not stoke even more divisiveness,” she said. Clinton struck a similar theme earlier this week in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. While campaigning before a largely white audience in Scranton on Monday, Clinton mentioned the protests in Milwaukee, which broke out after police shot and killed a black man there last weekend. ”Look at what’s happening in Milwaukee right now,” Clinton said. ”We’ve got urgent work to do to rebuild trust between police and communities and get back to the fundamental principle: Everyone should have respect for the law and be respected by the law.” Clinton’s Republican rival, Donald Trump, also talked about Milwaukee this week. During a campaign stop in the nearby suburb of West Bend, Trump accused Clinton of being   because of her calls for reform of the criminal justice system. ”She is against the police, believe me. You know it and I know it, and guess what: She knows it,” Trump told the crowd. Critics on the left, including groups like Black Lives Matter, have accused Clinton of being too slow to address concerns from   and their allies  —   a key part of the Democratic base  —   about aggressive policing. Clinton herself has acknowledged that tension. ”I know that just by saying all these things together, I may upset some people,” she said. Speaking to the African Methodist Episcopal Church General Conference on the day after the Dallas police shootings, Clinton called for national guidelines on the use of deadly force and better training for police. ”I’m talking about criminal justice reform the day after a horrific attack on police officers,” Clinton said. ”I’m talking about courageous honorable police officers just a few days after   killings in Louisiana and Minnesota.” While Hillary Clinton tries to navigate those conversations, Donald Trump is walking another line. This week, he’s been praising police while promising to bring ”law and order” to   neighborhoods. So far, though, he’s been making that case in front of mostly white audiences.": "171734",
    "Here’s a surprise news flash: Millennials are getting more of their news on cable TV. In the first quarter, Fox News attracted the highest number of millennials  —   famously addicted to their smartphones  —   with 67, 700 of those aged between 18 and 34 tuning in. That’s up 250 percent from the same period two years ago, when just 27, 100 millennial viewers were glued to Fox News, according to Nielsen data obtained by The Post. CNN isn’t far behind. It grew millennial viewership to 62, 900 from 34, 800 in 2015, while MSNBC just notched 35, 900 in the first quarter versus 20, 400 in the comparable period two years earlier. To be sure, millennials are the first generation to grow up attached to their digital devices, and the latest   figures aren’t big numbers when compared with the hundreds of millions of   that social networks like Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat notch each month. Still, data show a surprising trend  —   namely, that all three news networks grew the number of young adults watching their broadcasts on both a   and   basis. “It’s really the political climate,” says Billie Gold, director of programming research at Amplifi, a division of ad agency Dentsu Aegis Network. Millennials are “very socially conscious. They care about the environment and all the protests  —   they’re very concerned. ” Nonstop chaos in Washington, an investigation into Russian interference in the elections, wiretapping claims and allegations of fake news have made watching the news a nonstop reality show of epic proportions. Ratings typically fall off a cliff after an election, but this year, the audiences have held up, Gold notes. With the TV “upfronts” looming  —   a seasonal confab in which advertisers look to allocate $70 billion in annual budgets around the dial  —   growth in the ranks of young viewers is a welcome data point for news networks that typically skew older. Millennials are a   demographic for advertisers, even though they’re more likely to still live with their parents than at any time since 1880, according to Pew Research. There are now 75. 4 million millennials, who overtook baby boomers last year as the biggest segment of the US population. The news segment is on fire. Fox News, CNN and MSNBC have been hitting record ratings at a time when both general cable and broadcast networks are struggling to hold on to their viewers. In February, broadcast networks lost 11 percent of the commercial ratings in prime time while cable networks were off 10 percent, according to a study dubbed “Winter Is Here,” from independent research firm MoffettNathanson released on Wednesday. Just six networks of the top 25 cable outlets could boast of growth in viewership. Anecdotally, several industry executives told The Post their   kids are sitting down to watch the news with them in the evenings.

    "Industrial cleaning company Diversey has been dumped more times over the past 21 years than a   high school varsity captain. Over that span, the    Diversey has had five owners. Sealed Air on Monday became the latest dumper of the Charlotte, NC, company by agreeing to sell it to private equity firm Bain Capital for $3. 2 billion. In 2011, Sealed Air bought Diversey for $4. 3 billion from   Johnson Wax and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice. The frequent handoffs started in 1996 when Canadian beer giant Molson sold Diversey, which was losing money in the US, to European conglomerate Unilever. Six years later, its profits restored, Diversey was sold to Johnson Wax. By 2009, Johnson Wax was in financial trouble and sold off a huge stake to CD&R. “I’m not sure any of them ever got the results they wanted [from Diversey],” a former top Diversey executive told The Post. Diversey’s appeal lies in the fact that it is the   company in the industrial cleaning space. The biggest, Ecolab, generates better than 10 percent profit margins and it seems an easy model to duplicate: Sell industrial cleaning supplies for a relatively low margin, and service for a much higher margin. But those plans never bore much fruit. Gaining real market share in the US from Ecolab takes capital investment and patience, the executive said, and none of Diversey’s multiple owners had the ability or the will to make that effort. More recently, Sealed Air, whose most   brand is Bubble Wrap, thought it could package industrial cleaning supplies and the products it was already selling to the same customers. But it turns out “there are a number of channels to access customers and when you try to combine channels, you can create conflict,” the executive said. Diversey’s margins have improved greatly in the past 11 quarters, and Sealed Air believes it will have better focus if operated separately, the company said in a statement.": "128086",
    "Readers and staffers, primarily from Portland, Oregon, discuss and debate the various issues surrounding race, ethnicity, and class in the city. (The ongoing conversation was spurred by Alana Semuels’s article “The Racist History of Portland, the Whitest City in America. ”) If you have something to add, especially as a Portland native, please send us a note: hello@theatlantic. com. Alana’s recent piece on the racist history of Portland, Oregon, my hometown, cites a controversy that I remember: One incident captures how residents are failing to hear one another or have any sympathy for one another: In 2014, Trader Joe’s was in negotiations to open a new store in Albina. The Portland Development Commission, the city’s   agency, offered the company a steep discount on a patch of land to entice them to seal the deal. But the Portland African American Leadership Forum wrote a letter protesting the development, arguing that the Trader Joe’s was the latest attempt to profit from the displacement of African Americans in the city. By spending money incentivizing Trader Joe’s to locate in the area, the city was creating further gentrification without working to help locals stay in the neighborhood, the group argued. Trader Joe’s pulled out of the plan, and people in Portland and across the country scorned the black community for opposing the retailer. [Local historians] say that during that incident, critics of the African American community failed to take into account the history of Albina, which saw black families and businesses displaced again and again when whites wanted to move in.  A reader pushes back with a little more background: In this particular case that was a local black developer who had long been very active in the Albina neighborhood community who had gone through a quite lengthy negotiating process to develop that piece of land. [RIS note: The developer, Majestic Realty, was in fact based in California, but had hired a local   company, Colas Construction, as general contractor.] That piece of land, by the way, was a large, undeveloped brownfield that sits along a primary commercial corridor that had been vacant for over a decade, and it STILL sits there fenced off and growing weeds. There was no notable “neighborhood opposition” to the Trader Joe’s development UNTIL The Portland African American Leadership Forum [PAALF] a group virtually unheard of in the community until they challenged the TJ’s development. I wasn’t living in Portland when the Trader Joe’s deal fell through, but I remember the vacant lot. It’s located at Alberta Street and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, a busy thoroughfare that in the 2000s used to be lined with   restaurants, parking lots,   buildings, roadside bars —  more of a street to funnel people through than one to build community over, and one where my parents were skeptical of a teenage girl waiting for the bus. In 2013, according to an interactive map by The Oregonian, that intersection (represented by a green dot below) was in the heart of a food desert, with a significant number of   residents living more than half a mile from the nearest supermarket: That   data makes this particular case —  of a supermarket being shut out —  feel like a loss. Whatever the problems in the process of opening this lot for development, Trader Joe’s could have brought affordable groceries to the area. From The Oregonian: Grayson Dempsey, an   King resident who can see the vacant lot from her window, said she tried offering her support at neighborhood association meetings, but her voice was drowned out by the opposition. “I moved here when there were gunshots out the window,” Dempsey said. “I appreciate that (PAALF) is trying to talk about the origins of gentrification. That’s really essential, but they can’t stand up and say, ‘As residents of the King neighborhood, this is what we want.’ The residents of the King neighborhood want this to happen. ”   …      “We shouldn’t leave lots empty in the name of preserving the neighborhood,” she said. “Are we preserving the vacant lot history or do we want to bring it back to a vibrant neighborhood where people know their neighbors and feel safe walking around?” Fortunately, it’s looking now like the controversy will have a happy ending.  Last year, city officials announced that a different store, Natural Grocers, would be built on the vacant lot —  and that the development plan would also include building affordable housing on another   lot nearby, addressing activists’ concerns about local residents’ displacement. Meanwhile, St. Johns, the North Portland neighborhood where I grew up —  historically   and racially diverse, though seemingly segregated from street to street —  has been gentrifying rapidly too. The change is signified by the New Seasons, a regional, more affordable version of Whole Foods, that just opened up a few blocks from my parents’ house, replacing the   shuttered diner that had replaced a   McDonald’s. My mom, who’s been waiting for years for the stores nearby to carry more organic meat and produce, is thrilled. Yet she’s noticed the Fred Meyer supermarket around the corner has phased out its fish sauce and canned coconut milk, and drastically reduced its   selection. What used to be a full aisle of affordable Asian and Hispanic foods has been cut down to about six feet of shelf space. To compete with New Seasons, a clerk told her, Fred Meyer has changed its stock —  getting rid of brands targeted at local minority populations, while expanding its range of pricier,   products favored by young white professionals. “It’s like they’ve segregated us,” my mom says, half laughing, about the shrinking shelf space. Of course, it’s complicated: She hasn’t made a habit of buying her soy sauce at Fred Meyer for years. Instead, she drives out to East Portland or Beaverton to stock up at the Asian stores, where the soy sauce and patis —  Filipino fish sauce —  comes cheaper and in bulk. Still, Fred Meyer, where the cashiers know her face and remember her   son as a toddler, is where she goes every week for convenience, when she wants to stay close to home. It’s where she used to shop when she had young children and no time to drive out to the suburbs, and where she’d have to shop now if she didn’t have a car or an artist’s flexible work schedule. It’s a neighborhood store, and that’s the point: Beyond the question of soy sauce, what cutting back on Latino brands means in an area with a growing Latino population is that this supermarket is failing to reflect its neighborhood, which makes my mom —  and me —  worry that it may be failing to serve those neighbors. Where do you shop for food? Does your grocery store help you feel connected to your neighborhood? Do you prioritize convenience or cost? Foods that fit your culture or lifestyle? When a supermarket opens up in a food desert, how should it work to serve the existing community? We’d like to hear your thoughts at hello@theatlantic. com. Alana Semuels wrote a popular piece last month called “The Racist History of Portland, the Whitest City in America. ” Towards the end of it, she writes: Yet as the city became more progressive and “weird,” full of artists and techies and bikers, it did not have a conversation about its racist past. It still tends not to, even as gentrification and displacement continue in Albina and other neighborhoods. “If you were living here and you decided you wanted to have a conversation about race, you’d get the shock of your life,” Ed Washington, the longtime Portland resident, told me. “Because people in Oregon just don’t like to talk about it. ” Scores of Atlantic readers in Portland have been talking about Alana’s piece and emailing their views, so we’ve decided to convene a conversation about race in the city (via hello@theatlantic. com). To start things off, we’re focusing on Albina, the northeast area of Portland that historically housed the vast majority of the city’s African American residents. Albina now comprises the neighborhoods of Eliot, Boise, Humboldt, Irvington, King, Overlook, and Piedmont, plotted on this map: Here’s how Alana introduces Albina in her piece: As the city becomes more popular and   prices rise, it is Portland’s tiny African American population [6. 3 percent] that is being displaced to the   fringes of the city, leading to even less diversity in the city’s center. There are around 38, 000 African Americans in the city in Portland, according to Lisa K. Bates of Portland State University in recent years, 10, 000 of those 38, 000 have had to move from the center city to its fringes because of rising prices. The gentrification of the historically black neighborhood in central Portland, Albina, has led to conflicts between white Portlanders and   black residents over things like widening bicycle lanes and the construction of a new Trader Joe’s. Rosa Inocencio Smith, our new assistant editor for Notes (and writer of our Daily newsletter) will be posting a note soon about that Trader Joe’s controversy. Her hometown is Portland, so she will have a lot of great insight to share during our ongoing reader discussion. For my part, Portland has become an adopted hometown since my family moved there more than a decade ago, next to Albina, so I’m especially interested in this topic as well. But for a much closer firsthand perspective, here’s one of many readers who grew up in Albina: I lived in this neighborhood in the late ’80s. I still do. The first thing this article (and Kamau Bell’s CNN show [United Shades of America —  relevant clip here]) gets wrong is that this was a “black” neighborhood. Even when it was the center of black culture in Portland, it was still 40 percent white. Here’s a breakdown of that demographic over the decades: Back to our reader: The second thing is that blacks some how have a “historical claim” to Albina because they as a majority occupied it from roughly  . Hell, you could make the claim that neighboring Overlook is a “Polish” neighborhood if you want to go back far enough, and that the city should implement policies to promote Polish ownership, but nobody ever does. The third thing is over just how much safer (though in some respects less fun) this neighborhood is now. I too have had suspects pursued through my backyard, blocks cordoned off, gun fights in front of the house, I had to dive behind a car because of a   [reported examples here and here] been witness to and a victim of arson, and I can attest to this sad fact: More white people = less crime of all varieties, from littering to murder. As a homeowner here, amen to that. That “sad fact” seems very dubious. Gun crimes, for one, are dispersed throughout Portland, not just the Albina area: Residential burglary is similarly dispersed, while street robbery and   assaults are mostly concentrated downtown, across the river from Albina. Overall, according to an April 2015 news report that featured the crime statistics cited above, crime in Portland has “plummeted since the 1990s,” much like the rest of the country: Portland State Professor Kris Henning said many residents don’t realize that crime has declined considerably over the past 20 years. Henning said they devour so much crime news they think the city is more dangerous than it is. “Of the 13 crimes we looked at, the only one that increased significantly was bike theft,” [PSU student Kelsey] Baleilevuka said. Overall,   crimes in Portland have dropped 84%. Residential burglaries are down 61% motor vehicle thefts dropped 70% home robberies are down 76% and street robberies are down 70%.   …     Excluding homicides, crimes involving guns have moved from inner Northeast Portland toward Gresham. Another reader who lived in Albina makes a distinction between renters and homeowners in the neighborhood: Per the claim that 10, 000 African Americans were “forced out” of inner   I lived in the neighborhood starting in the late ’80s. Yes, it was   dangerous, and full of abandoned houses. Yes, I witnessed quite a few  . But many of my neighbors who were black and owned their homes were ready and willing, as prices increased throughout the ’90s, to sell out and move without being forced out. If you are a renter who can’t afford the rising rents, then you are forced to move. And this has happened to quite a few of my renting friends who have lived in the neighborhood for over 20 years, and yes, they are white. This next reader also attests to the crime in Albina in the ’80s, and the exodus of both black and white neighbors as development and higher prices arrived: It’s weird to read an Atlantic article about something I personally experienced. It’s a bit of a trip down memory lane. I’m white, and my parents moved to the Albina area in the late ’80s. They purchased and refurbished a 1920s bungalow as part of an urban renewal program. This made them the tip of the spear for gentrification, and the breakup of a historically black neighborhood. Like all people who kick off gentrification, they soon complained bitterly about the later newcomers who shoved property prices into the stratosphere. We moved from the area before I hit middle school, but I can confirm many of the points in the article. Rentals proliferated through the neighborhood. The area was still rough when we lived there. Police presence was constant, and it wasn’t until we moved that I realized constant police presence isn’t a thing in all neighborhoods. Once in a blue moon there were gunshots at night. My parents gave me lectures about not picking up trash and avoiding the used needles that littered public spaces. I vividly remember an incident when the police sealed off our entire block and ended up pursuing a fleeing man directly through our backyard. But there was definitely a community there. It was a mix of black and   white people who seemed to get along in a    sense. I often wonder what became of our old neighbors. Several adjacent properties were owned by black people who seemed to be just holding steady. With property prices in that area increasing about 10x since then, I wonder if they could even afford the taxes for their places if they stayed. Honestly, though, I don’t know if the breakup of the Albina black enclaves in Portland could have been prevented in any way. Portland in general is increasingly hostile to native populations from a financial standpoint. It’s overrun with wealthy tech money that dwarfs what used to be there. I recently visited part of my old neighborhood, and it’s a romping ground for Audis, Teslas, and people who buy $200 bottles of wine for dinner. Myself and my extended family were long ago shoved out into the suburbs. Race aside, nobody with a “normal” job can afford to buy property in many locations mentioned in the article. I don’t know exactly what people think could have been done to “preserve” the neighborhood, other than making some sort of bizarre   law that only allowed people of a certain race to live there. The real problem in Portland for   people of all colors is a lack of affordable housing. And the city’s response to that has been typically bureaucratic and inept. Here’s one more reader emphasizing class: I lived in Portland in the 1970s and have a child who lives there now. Urban renewal was not motivated by race it was motivated by money. If you lived in a cute or interesting neighborhood and someone with more money came along and wanted to live there too, they got to stay and you had to go. I had to leave Portland because I did not have the money or the job to stay. I had lived there for four years. The first year I lived within six blocks of the medical school, but by my last year of living in “Portland,” I lived in Tigard. I could have either lived in Tigard or I could have lived in Gresham. I was not pushed out of the downtown area because of my race I was pushed out because of money. If you have also lived in Albina and want to provide any contrasting views and experiences, please drop us a note. *** One question that arises from Alana’s article: Does gentrification ever increase opportunity for poor residents? Definitely, according to Lance Freeman, the director of the Urban Planning program at Columbia. In an email he sent me last summer for a piece on gentrification, Freeman described some of the upsides: Gentrification brings new amenities and services that benefit not only the newcomers but long term residents too.   supermarkets that carry fresh produce, restaurants where residents could dine in, and   parks are often lacking in poor neighborhoods prior to gentrification. For   residents who are able to stay, either due to housing subsidies, owning their home, or their own earning capacity improving, these changes are often appreciated. And most residents are able to stay, at least according to a 2004 study that Freeman conducted with economist Frank Braconi they found that   African Americans in New York City were more likely to remain in gentrifying neighborhoods than stagnant ones. They noted similar findings in Boston. And here’s how my colleague Yoni Appelbaum, in a post by   Coates, summarized another study, from the University of  : “In plain English, they’re arguing that gentrification isn’t forcing people out it’s bringing in yuppies and hipsters, and hanging on to   minority households that would otherwise have decamped for the suburbs. ” In the case of Portland, whose black residents were historically confined to one area, wouldn’t the displacement of many Albina renters out to “The Numbers” —  the city’s   outer neighborhoods, which are historically white —  have, at minimum, a silver lining of more racial integration? And   African Americans who own their homes in Albina are likely to remain, thus blending with the   newcomers of all backgrounds. (More than 26 percent of Portland residents are not classified “white” or “black. ”) That sort of gentrification —  black neighborhoods becoming more white and white neighborhoods becoming more black, with at least more investment in Albina, if not The Numbers —  seems like the least bad outcome. The risk, in my mind, is if the movement of people and money occurs too quickly, without reasonable measures in place to mitigate mass displacement (e. g. rent control,   housing, Section 8 vouchers). A 2015 report by Governing magazine determined that Portland is, in fact, the   city in the U. S. —  something that should give everyone pause. Do you have any strong views about gentrification, especially as it relates to Portland? Let us know. *** For continued reading on Albina, a reader recommends a history published in 1993 by the Portland Bureau of Planning: As someone who lived in Portland for years, and now lives elsewhere in Oregon, I was glad to read the article by Alana Semuels. One book I would recommend to anyone who wants to read about this history at greater length would be Portland’s Albina Community, available online from Multnomah County.  Despite the provenance, it’s unvarnished. It dates from the ’90s, though, before gentrification, when Albina was still   black and had a different set of problems. Another reader points to a much older chapter in Portland’s history: I’ve been an Oregonian my whole life, and can attest to Semuels’s article. I’ve been doing some work on local history, and something that may be worth bringing up is the foundation of the Portland Police, largely by James H. Lappeus. Lappeus was a former soldier that, after the   War, helped form other veterans in 1849 into the Hounds. To quote a 1920 article by Rockwell Hunt, “In short, the Hounds were a band of desperadoes, or public robbers, who committed repeated aggressions and offenses upon the people of San Francisco under the flimsy pretense of opposition to foreigners, given colors by General Persifer Smith’s declared intention of driving off all foreigners. The gang paralyzed the town with terror. ” Hunt gives too much credit to the Committee of Vigilance that expelled the Hounds, but several of the Hounds —  Lappeus included —  went to Portland. Lappeus, as noted, started the Portland Police. The distant infrastructure in a relatively unpopulated part of the nation ended up continuing to be a    infrastructure with more than a little splash of white criminal activity (see [crime boss] Jim Elkins, for instance). The perception that the police, and general infrastructure, in Portland is racist is a historic fact. The only way to really change it is to recognize and address it. There has been movement to that direction, but it has —  and will be —  slow going.         For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.

    "Foreign governments such as Russia and China may have been involved in the collapse of a voter registration website in the   to the EU referendum, a committee of MPs has claimed. A report by the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee (PACAC) said MPs were deeply concerned about the allegations of foreign interference in last year’s Brexit vote.  The committee does not identify who may have been responsible, but has noted that both Russia and China use an approach to   based on an understanding of mass psychology and of how to exploit individuals. The findings follow repeated claims that Russia has been involved in trying to influence the US and French presidential elections.  Ministers were forced to extend the deadline to register to vote in the EU referendum after the collapse of the government’s website on 7 June, 100 minutes before the deadline.  The collapse resulted in concerns that tens of thousands of people could have been disenfranchised.  At the time, the government said it was the result of an unprecedented spike in demand, with more than 500, 000 people trying to register on the final day. The report, published on Wednesday, said there were clues that a distributed denial of service attack (DDOS) using botnets  —   a network of computers infected with malicious software  —   was used to overwhelm the site.  “The crash had indications of being a DDOS ‘attack’. We understand that this is very common and easy to do with botnets. .. The key indicants are timing and relative volume rate,” the committee’s report said. While the incident had no material effect on the outcome of the referendum, the committee said it was crucial that lessons were learned for future votes that must extend beyond purely technical issues.  The report noted: “The US and UK understanding of ‘cyber’ is predominantly technical and computer  .  “For example, Russia and China use a cognitive approach based on understanding of mass psychology and of how to exploit individuals.  “The implications of this different understanding of   as purely technical or as reaching beyond the digital to influence public opinion, for the interference in elections and referendums are clear.  “PACAC is deeply concerned about these allegations about foreign interference,” the report concluded.  Britain is being hit by dozens of   a month, including attempts by Russian   hackers to steal defence and foreign policy secrets, GCHQ’s new security chief, Ciaran Martin, said in February. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said the National Cyber Security Centre, which Martin heads, had blocked 34, 550 “potential attacks” on government departments and members of the public in the six months to February  —   about 200 cases a day. The committee, which is chaired by the senior backbencher Bernard Jenkin, was also highly critical of the way David Cameron held the referendum to “call the bluff” of his critics and then resigned when he lost.  It said that in future referendums, the prime minister of the day should be prepared to carry on in office and to implement the result, whatever the outcome.  “There was no proper planning for a leave vote so the EU referendum opened up much new controversy and left the prime minister’s credibility destroyed,” it said.  “It should be reasonable to presume that the sitting prime minister and   administration will continue in office and take responsibility for the referendum result in either eventuality. ”  According to the report, there were many occasions in the run up to the vote when it appeared officials were being drawn into “referendum controversy” damaging the civil service’s reputation for impartiality. A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said there was no evidence to support the committee’s claim of possible interference from foreign governments.  “We have been very clear about the cause of the website outage in June 2016. It was due to a spike in users just before the registration deadline. There is no evidence to suggest malign intervention,” she said.  “We conducted a full review into the outage and have applied the lessons learned. We will ensure these are applied for all future polls and online services. ”": "150406",
    "WASHINGTON  —   As Chase Sherman was returning home with his parents and fiancée from his brother’s wedding in November, he began to hallucinate. Apparently reacting to synthetic marijuana he took days earlier, he bit his girlfriend and tried to jump out of the back seat of the car as the family drove through Georgia toward Florida. About an hour outside Atlanta, at Mile Marker 55 on Interstate 85, his fiancée pulled over the car and his mother called the police, hoping they would help calm Mr. Sherman, 32. Less than a   later, Mr. Sherman, who worked at a   parasailing business on the Gulf Coast, was dead. He was stunned numerous times with Taser guns carried by two sheriff’s deputies, while handcuffed in the back seat of a rental car. Like other recent episodes involving the police, this one was captured on video, in this case by body cameras worn by the sheriff’s deputies as they tried to subdue Mr. Sherman. The video, a copy of which was obtained in recent days by The New York Times, is similar to recordings of fatal encounters involving law enforcement officers in Chicago North Charleston, S. C. and Staten Island. Each one depicts in stark terms a response from officers that resulted in a death. In this instance, there are no racial overtones: Both Mr. Sherman and the deputy sheriffs are white. The footage from Georgia was released Friday by prosecutors in Coweta County in response to requests from the family and the news media. It shows the sheriff’s deputies struggling to subdue Mr. Sherman as he tried to get out of the car, stunning him repeatedly with their Taser guns while he was handcuffed, and reacting frantically after realizing he was dead. Mr. Sherman’s death was a homicide due to “an altercation with law enforcement with several trigger pulls of an electronic control device,” according to his death certificate, which said that he had been shoved to the floor of the car and that his torso was compressed “by the body weight of another individual. ” “How can they do this when they know someone is having a breakdown?” said L. Chris Stewart, a lawyer for the Sherman family. “Once they started shocking him, how can someone comply when they’re being electrocuted over and over again?” Kevin and Mary Ann Sherman, Chase Sherman’s parents, said they were not sure what had caused their son’s odd behavior. They said they first became concerned when he began acting erratically while they were in the Dominican Republic for the wedding. Chase told his mother that he had taken the synthetic marijuana the day before they traveled there. “He was scared when we were down there,” Ms. Sherman said. “He said he heard different bad things were happening in different countries. He would see a couple of things that weren’t there. He thought people were watching him, and he didn’t want to go anywhere without his mom and dad or brother. ” But his parents said he had seemed fine on the flight back to Atlanta, where they were to change planes and continue their trip home to Destin, Fla. Then, as they waited at the Atlanta airport, Mr. Sherman grew agitated. The family decided it would be better to drive the rest of the way, so they rented a car. Not long into the drive, Mr. Sherman began trying to jump out of the car. “I couldn’t keep him in the car  —   he didn’t know where he was and was disoriented,” Kevin Sherman said. “I couldn’t keep him in the car by myself, so we needed to call for medical assistance. ” A body camera worn by one of the deputies started recording while en route to assist the Shermans. By the time he reached their car, parked on the shoulder of the highway, another deputy was already grappling with Mr. Sherman, who was handcuffed, in the car’s back seat. On the video, Mr. Sherman seemed alternately calm and desperate to get out of the car. To try to stop him, one of the deputies took out a Taser gun and pointed it at him, telling him to stop moving. Mr. Sherman grabbed the Taser gun, and a fight for it ensued. With Mr. Sherman’s mother and his fiancée, Patti Galloway, watching from the front of the car, the deputy shot him several times with the Taser, and the second deputy punched him in the head. The deputies then told the two women to get out of the car, and Ms. Sherman pointed her finger at the two deputies, pleading with them not to stun her son. Mr. Sherman was stunned again, and then he appeared to wrestle away control of the Taser despite still being handcuffed. Moments later, an emergency medical technician who had arrived at the scene tried to help subdue Mr. Sherman. “O. K. I’m dead, I’m dead,” Mr. Sherman said as he was shoved to the floor and wedged between the front and back seats. “I quit, I quit,” he could be heard saying. The medical technician pushed down on Mr. Sherman’s body. “I got all the weight of the world on him now,” he could be heard saying before Mr. Sherman was shocked again. But suddenly realizing that Mr. Sherman was not breathing, the deputy sheriffs and the medical technician pulled him out of the car and began performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation while his parents and Ms. Galloway watched. “There was no way for him to resist,” said the lawyer, Mr. Stewart. “For four minutes and 10 seconds after he said ‘I quit,’ they still tased him and kept him on the ground. That’s torture, and they killed him. ” Mr. Sherman’s death was initially investigated by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which made the evidence it collected available to the district attorney of Coweta County, Peter J. Skandalakis. Mr. Skandalakis said Friday that his office’s investigation into Mr. Sherman’s death was continuing. “I really haven’t formed a final opinion about it,” he said, adding that his office had planned to release the video before the inquiry’s conclusion because of “public interest in the case. ” He said he hoped to meet eventually with the Sherman family. In the meantime, the deputies who responded to the family’s request for help have not been suspended, according to Mr. Stewart, and are still working.": "23214",
    "What is the panic button exactly? Really, I want to know what it is and then I want to know its value. There has been much discussion of whether the Yankees need to press such a thing. To what end? Now is not time for panic or  —   worse  —   the kind of maneuvers panic evokes. The Yankees need to accept who they are, and if they are a bad team  —   the early indicators are that is their identity  —   so be it. The big mistake would be trying to fix something with a Raul Mondesi or Vernon Wells. The Yankees have been contenders for 23 straight years. That is never happening again, unless this club rights itself and makes it 24. Many executives around the game have predicted the     season for the Yankees in recent years, and then have been stunned when it did not occur.  Judgment day finally may be upon this franchise. The   record reflects a team that has just two elite performers  —   Andrew Miller and Dellin Betances (yes, I still consider Betances elite despite the recent hiccups)  —   and both are symbiotic players: They need others to excel to make their jobs meaningful. Adding Aroldis Chapman in a week merely will give the Yankees three   guitarists in a band with no drummers or bass players or songwriters. After missing the playoffs in 2013, the Yankees abandoned their   strategy to get under the $189 million luxury tax threshold and invested nearly a half a billion in Masahiro Tanaka, Jacoby Ellsbury, Brian McCann and Carlos Beltran. In   the Yankees were not very good, but refused to accept who they were and pushed to 85 and 84 wins and pseudo contention, failing to seize opportunities to trade Robinson Cano and David Robertson. In that   window, they refused to accept whom they had become and missed the chances to accelerate a rebuild. I admire the general spirit of what they do. In an age when so many teams are tanking, the Yankees are trying to retain a George Steinbrenner mandate of winning year to year. But Steinbrenner operated in an era when perhaps his team alone, or maybe one or two others, could sign big free agents. But Zack Greinke really signed with the Diamondbacks, Max Scherzer with the Nationals. More clubs can and do play in this forum. The structure of how much can be spent in the draft and internationally further scuttles advantages long held by the Yankees. Once more, no team is putting together 23 straight winning seasons again  —   not under these rules. It is hard to win and keep winning. We thought the Astros had decoded the    strategy. Yet after beating the Yankees in the   game last year, they have a worse record than the Yankees this season. The Dodgers, with all their money spent, have not been to a World Series since 1988 and are . 500 now. The Yankees can look to the Red Sox for some inspiration. They won it all in 2013 and have finished in last place each of the past two seasons. But 2015 was not a waste. The Red Sox used the season to stick with or learn about Xander Bogaerts, Jackie Bradley Jr. and Travis Shaw, all of whom contributed   to sweeping the Yanks at Fenway over the weekend and jumping Boston to first place. The Yankees also should look to their own history. They began the 2005 campaign at  . Steinbrenner empowered Brian Cashman to do what he felt was correct, and the GM decided against following the organization’s   DNA. He resolved to protect the best players in a thin system (namely Phil Hughes). Robinson Cano and   Wang were promoted along with a journeyman named Aaron Small. All paid big dividends, as did a minor trade for Shawn Chacon. Those Yankees actually won 95 games. This group would be   to duplicate that result, but the philosophy should be the same. Try to figure this out internally. Don’t take on more veterans and their contracts as window dressing. If the team is finally terrible, then use July to make the best   deals for Chapman and Miller, and if there is a market for     Carlos Beltran and Mark Teixeira (though I suspect he would not waive his   clause) deal them, too. See if Rob Refsnyder can play third (did you think Travis Shaw could do so at this time last year?) and give Gary Sanchez half the catching responsibility. Now is no time for panic for the Yankees. There is going to be opportunity, even under the   scenario of being   for the first time in a quarter of a century. The Yankees have to be prepared to accept being bad in attempts to be real good again.": "138446",
    "Donald J. Trump appears to believe he owes little to the Republican establishment donor set, a majority of whom opposed him. He also ran a campaign that challenged longstanding shibboleths of American diplomacy. Mr. Trump’s choice of ambassadors could be a sign of how serious he is about both those stances. But as his transition team begins sifting through possible choices for a dozen major embassies, the signals are unclear. Two of his three choices so far, Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa for China, and David M. Friedman for Israel, are loyalists, not big donors. The third, Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina, picked as ambassador to the United Nations, was an ardent critic of Mr. Trump. Mr. Branstad has described President Xi Jinping of China as an “old friend” Ms. Haley and Mr. Friedman have no diplomatic experience. But the nomination of Mr. Friedman, a conservative who has been deeply critical of the   lobbying group J Street, and who has vowed to move the United States Embassy to Jerusalem, has roiled large sections of the foreign policy establishment  —   just the kind of disruption Mr. Trump liked to emphasize in his campaign. So far, Mr. Friedman is the exception. As the intense jockeying for ambassadorships has begun among donors, loyalists to Mr. Trump and, in some cases, people close to his children, his advisers have potentially competing priorities. If Mr. Trump chooses Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets who is a longtime Republican donor and a friend of the   or someone like Peter S. Kalikow, the New York developer and Trump supporter, he would be following a familiar script. If he chooses someone like Jon M. Huntsman Jr. for Japan, Mr. Trump would be trying to match a Republican establishment figure with a region he is familiar with. Mr. Huntsman has served as ambassador to China and Singapore. If he goes for someone like Robert Pence, a Virginia developer who did not support Mr. Trump’s candidacy but who has been recommended by Vice   Mike Pence, it would fall more in line with his choice of Ms. Haley and of bringing outsiders into the fold. (The two Pences are not related). The expectation is that Mr. Trump will begin by rewarding supporters with appointments to Western Europe or the Caribbean, as is often the case with new administrations. But they could also include donors to his campaign or transition, people he might need again in the future. “They generally start out more political,” said Asgeir Sigfusson, the communications director for the American Foreign Service Association. “The numbers will even out. ” In previous administrations, he said, about 70 percent of nominations were foreign service professionals and 30 percent were political appointees. It remains to be seen if Mr. Trump will adhere to that breakdown, Mr. Sigfusson said. Aides to Mr. Trump declined to comment, beyond saying that discussion about candidates was in the early stages. There are some favorites among the names Mr. Trump’s advisers are batting around, however, and meetings on the subject are expected to increase in frequency starting this week. Mr. Trump’s aides are sifting through a broad list of recommendations from people involved in the transition process, including the  ’s daughter Ivanka and his    Jared Kushner. As a result, the suggestions have included people who did not immediately support the Trump ticket, such as Ronald J. Gidwitz, who backed Jeb Bush in the primaries. There have been some aspirational suggestions, such as Mr. Huntsman, who served as ambassador to China in the Obama administration, for Japan or Michèle A. Flournoy, a top Pentagon official in the Obama administration, as an ambassador to NATO. The two have deep knowledge of policy and have been spoken of favorably by Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief White House strategist. But a number of Mr. Trump’s top advisers oppose them. Then there are more personal recommendations from people involved in the transition. One was for Morris Goldfarb, the chief executive of the   Apparel Group, which had a licensing agreement for Ms. Trump’s apparel line. Another was former Gov. James Gilmore of Virginia, who has been recommended by Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, a Trump adviser. Ivana Trump, Mr. Trump’s first wife, cheekily recommended herself to The New York Post for ambassador to the Czech Republic. John Jay LaValle, chairman of the Suffolk County Republican Committee in New York and one of Mr. Trump’s few vocal defenders in the campaign’s final days, could see a plum post. And there are a raft of donors and longtime Republicans angling for appointments who could expect particularly close scrutiny by Democrats during confirmation hearings. “I think confirmation is always problematic,” said Mel Sembler, a party   appointed ambassador to Australia by the elder President George Bush and to Italy by the younger. “The first time out, it was a long and embarrassing and difficult process,” Mr. Sembler said. Old scars become new information as senators start their review, he said. Some donors could see old troubles resurface. Mr. Kalikow, the New York developer, who filed for personal bankruptcy when he owned The New York Post more than two decades ago, has been mentioned for a possible post. So has Georgette Mosbacher, a socialite whose husband, now deceased, was the focus of a lawsuit over a flawed census count in 1990. Neither Mr. Kalikow nor Ms. Mosbacher would comment for this article. Duke Buchan, major supporter of Jeb Bush and a defender of the work of Right to Rise, the “super PAC” backing that candidate, joined the Trump effort in the summer and contributed significantly to his campaign. Mr. Buchan has expressed interest in becoming ambassador to Spain, where he says he studied and where a company he once held stock in recently owned property. He also used to own shares in a company that holds military contracts, records show. Mr. Buchan, who does not know Mr. Trump well, has had blunt discussions about how to best position himself for an ambassadorship, according to people close to the transition. He did not respond to requests for comment. Fred V. Malek, a former aide to President Richard M. Nixon and to the elder President Bush, said that being a donor did not guarantee anything. “It doesn’t mean that somebody can be a   and just have an ambassadorship,” he said. “They have to have some credentials. ” At least two prospective candidates from the donor community, according to people with direct knowledge of the discussions, are likely to end up with posts. Lewis M. Eisenberg, the Republican National Committee finance chairman who raised money with Mr. Trump’s choice for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, is seen as a possible choice for Italy. Mr. Johnson, the Jets owner, is a leading choice for Britain. Joseph Forgione, who was passed over for secretary of housing and development, has support to become ambassador to the Vatican. So does William E. Simon Jr. an ally of Rudolph W. Giuliani, who recommended him. R. Nicholas Burns, an ambassador to Greece under President Bill Clinton, said that the State Department typically put forward a list of people to consider, and that incoming presidents should be aware of their options. “I think   Trump would be well advised to broaden the circle of people he consults in making these appointments,” Mr. Burns said.": "22906",

Among other topics, this month picks include a look at why Americans have reacted so deeply to Marie Kondo s cleaning philosophy, whether or not Hillary can satisfy devotees to Bernie s economic plan, and a deep dive into the unsolved murder of a banker in Puerto Rico. If you ve missed a recent roundup, you can find them here, here, and here.  Food Fight ? Malcolm Gladwell | Revisionist History, Bowdoin College in Maine and Vassar College in upstate New York are roughly the same size. They compete for the same students. Both have long traditions of academic excellence. But one of those schools is trying hard to close the gap between rich and poor in American society ”and paying a high price for its effort. The other is making that problem worse ”and reaping rewards as a result.  Food Fight, ? the second of the   Revisionist History miniseries on opening up college to poor kids, focuses on a seemingly unlikely target: how the food each school serves in its cafeteria can improve or distort the educational system. * * *  Marie Kondo and the Ruthless War on Stuff ? Taffy   | The New York Times, People had an unnaturally strong reaction to the arrival of this woman and her promises of   magic. There were people who had been doing home organizing for years by then, and they sniffed at her severe methods. (One professional American organizer sent me a picture of a copy of Kondo s book, annotated with green sticky notes marking where she approved of the advice and pink ones where she disapproved. The green numbered 16 the pink numbered more than 50). But then there were the women who knew that Kondo was speaking directly to them. They called themselves Konverts, and they say their lives have truly changed as a result of using her decluttering methods: They could see their way out of the stuff by aiming upward. * * *  Demand Curve ? Brooke Unger | 1843, So why does HermÃ¨s starve the market for Birkins, when it could sell many more, and so make much more money? HermÃ¨s says that the constraint is the availability of   skins and people qualified to work with them. HermÃ¨s s   division (mÃ©tier, in company parlance) hires 200 craftspeople a year and takes two years to train them. The limit on the number of bags that can be made is therefore a natural one. Like gold and Bitcoins, HermÃ¨s suggests, Birkins are mined, not simply made. * * *  Fences: A Brexit Diary ? Zadie Smith | New York Review of Books, What have you done, Boris? What have you done, Dave? Yet within this tale of our solipsistic leaders, thoughtlessly lighting a fuse, there is contained a less pleasing story of our own Londoncentric solipsism, which seems to me equally real, and has formed a different kind of veil, perhaps just as hard to see through as the blinding personal ambition of a man like Boris. The profound shock I felt at the result ”and which so many other Londoners seem to have experienced ”suggests at the very least that we must have been living behind a kind of veil, unable to see our own country for what it has become. * * *  Could Hillary Become the Champion of the 99 Percent? ? Gideon   | New York Times Magazine, Much of the left, including the significant bloc that rejected Clinton in the primaries in favor of Bernie Sanders and his call for  revolution, ? finds Wong and her allies delusional in their hope that  Rewriting the Rules ? might be realized in Democratic Party practice. But the Sanders and Trump insurrections revealed an appetite for economic populism that no one in either party establishment had quite anticipated. Now Roosevelt and other progressive groups are wagering that a mandate for economic overhaul might already exist, and that it might even be carried out by the woman who always was the party s   nominee. Wong herself believes that the financial crisis radically destabilized the politics of the American economy, possibly for decades to come, and that 2016 might well mark the early commotion of a genuine political realignment. * * *  The Strange Story of a Murdered Banker in Puerto Rico ? Today, almost everyone in San Juan banking circles has a theory about the murder. Some believe only Colombian hit men could pull off such an assassination. Others say Spagnoletti had enemies in the U. S. who caught up with him. His widow, Marisa, revealed her own theory in a 2013 lawsuit: She said he was killed because he uncovered fraud at the bank and fired an executive he suspected of embezzlement. Doral s lawyers called her claims ridiculous, and after Marisa admitted in a deposition that she had no evidence, she withdrew the suit. Since then, new details of the killing have emerged. And according to former Doral executives and people working on the criminal investigation, the widow was onto something.  Let s use our common sense for a second, ? says MarÃ a DomÃ nguez, who was in charge of an investigation into Doral as first assistant U. S. attorney in San Juan until she retired last year.  This guy was brought by the bank to put the house in order. He starts uncovering certain things that are irregular at the bank. He starts to take corrective action. These circumstances strongly suggest a financial motive to get this guy out of the way. ? * * *  Why Your Company Needs More Ceremonies ? Patti Sanchez | Harvard Business Review, We often use ceremonies to celebrate good things: big promotions, business victories, and so on. But they can be just as powerful when used to acknowledge difficulties, mark dark passages, and help those affected by change move on. It s important to take a moment in difficult times to communally honor those who have made sacrifices or experienced hardship in the course of change. Sometimes, a dose of levity can help. As part of his effort to get developers at Apple to transition from Mac OS 9 to Mac OS X, Steve Jobs held a mock funeral at the 2002 Worldwide Developers Conference. With sad music playing in the background, Jobs placed a large box labeled  Mac OS 9 ? into a coffin on stage and then delivered a eulogy for the operating system that had been  a friend to us all. ? * * *  The Loneliness of Being Black in San Francisco ? Thomas Fuller | The New York Times,  You get the feeling that people are thinking,  You re still here?  ? said Barbara Gainer, a probation officer and a jazz singer. She lives in the western reaches of the city, a neighborhood that was once predominantly black but now is mostly   a segment that now makes up 34 percent of the city s population, up from 13 percent in 1970. Ms. Gainer says she is regularly asked if she wants to sell her house her mailbox fills up with solicitations. The inquiries were flattering at first because they reminded her of the value of her property, but now she feels singled out. She remembers one couple in particular who approached her four or five times about selling. She tried to dissuade them.  I said:  Even if I sold you my house and you gave me this big price, why would I do that? Where would I live?  ? The reply stunned her:  You should go to Antioch. That s where your people go. ? * * *  The   Barista ? Jody Hoff | Stitcher, Imagine your morning coffee run: You walk in, you put in the order, Â say hi to the cashier, then you pay. After a few minutes your name is called, you pick up your latte or espresso and then you re out the door. But did you ever stop and think about that person behind the counter making your coffee? How did they end up there?": "79428",
    "CHESTER, Vt.  —   The way A J Jackson tells it, he kept his head ducked down and pretended to fiddle with his cellphone as he walked into the boys’ bathroom and headed for a stall at Green Mountain Union High School here. But the way some of his classmates see it, A J was still Autumn Jackson, a girl in boys’ clothing, who had violated an intimate sanctum, while two boys were standing at a urinal, their private parts exposed. “It’s like me going into a girls’ bathroom wearing a wig,” Tanner Bischofberger, 15, a classmate of A J Jackson’s, who was not one of those in the bathroom, said this week. “It’s just weird. ” A complaint about Mr. Jackson’s using the boys’ bathroom set off a protest by students advocating the right of their transgender classmate to use the bathroom of his choice. On Thursday, the schools superintendent announced a new practice at the high school allowing transgender students to use the   bathroom of their choice, rather than being encouraged to use a   bathroom. The announcement came a day before the Obama  administration’s national directive was announced. But this week, there was a counterprotest by students like Mr. Bischofberger wearing   showing the male and female figures commonly used to label bathrooms, over the words “Straight Pride. ” Like much of the country, this rural school of 300 students in seventh through 12th grade, where everyone insists there were never any cliques, is divided over the bathroom issue, with the teenagers here carrying out a proxy culture war for their parents and the country. Still struggling to form opinions about what makes a civil society, they openly quote what they have heard their parents say about the merits or demerits of transgender bathrooms. And the dispute has driven apart young people who grew up together and were once friends. Some say the new rule opens the door to sexual predators disguised as someone they are not. Others say it just violates tradition. A society has rules for a reason, and this is one of those rules, that’s just the way it is, they say. But on a more basic level, students at Green Mountain are complaining that a small vocal minority of gay, lesbian and, as far as they know, one  —   or maybe two  —   transgender students among them are trampling on the rights of the majority to decide what the rules of conduct should be. That idea of a minority’s ruling unfairly is what motivated the father of one student to order the “Straight Pride”   online last week and send them to school with his daughter, who declined to be interviewed. The    students say gay people are being celebrated at the expense of straight people. “I just want to be clear: I accept everybody being proud,” said Daniel Baldwin, a    junior. Sitting at a table in the school hallway, a copy of “The Catcher in the Rye” open in front of him, he wore a “Straight Pride” shirt pulled over a shirt dedicated to Slayer, a   band. “Everybody has the right to be who they are. ” Mr. Baldwin said he thought people should use male or female bathrooms depending on what was written on their birth certificates. But he also said he would defend A J if someone tried to bully him for being transgender, or even for using the boys’ bathroom. “I would step up for A J,” he said. “We’re Americans. We’re supposed to be civil. ” Listening to him, Mr. Jackson said he was dismayed by how they had been torn apart. “Oh, my God, we used to talk for hours about music,” he said. More broadly, the issue here has pitted resident against resident, often along social and economic lines. This is a place where   transplants wearing Birkenstocks and artsy jewelry mingle with   people in   boots who know how to handle a shotgun and proudly inhabit the homes of their ancestors. Despite Vermont’s image as a place of bucolic egalitarianism, home of the avowedly socialist candidate for president, tensions over privilege and tradition simmer just under the surface, and the bathroom wars have brought them to the fore. “I go in and do my thing and leave, but I have a concern about child molesters and pedophiles,” Joe Kopacz, 48, who runs a   operation, said as he stopped into Lisai’s Chester Market. Society does not change on a dime, especially   society, said Deb Brown, a member of the Green Mountain Union High School board, speaking in MacLaomainn’s, a pub and popular gathering spot that she owns with her husband. For people like her daughter, who was on girls’ sports teams with A J when he was Autumn, this is intensely personal, not just philosophical. “As we move forward as a community, there has to be compassion on both sides,” Ms. Brown said. “He needs to understand that this has been 15 years that students have known him one way. It’s obviously his choice, but maybe he should have respect for his classmates right now. ” Mr. Jackson has gradually been making the transition from a vivacious girl with a big smile and long wavy locks to a husky boy with chopped hair dyed several shades of green, snakebite piercings in his lips and gauges embedded in his earlobes. His chest is visibly bound, and because he has not yet started taking male hormones  —   he plans to do that, and also to have “top surgery,” he says  —   his face is smooth and still has feminine contours. He once thought he was lesbian, and is still attracted to girls. His mother, Tracy, a case manager for children with developmental disabilities, and his father, Scott, a mechanical engineer, came to Vermont from Connecticut to try it out 20 years ago and stayed. They brought up A J and his older brother in a log cabin in the woods, where they raise chickens and ducks, including a duck named Bernie, for you know who. “A typical American family,” his mother said, smiling. He was in sixth grade when he realized he was meant to be a boy, he said, and came out to the school last year in ninth grade, sending emails to teachers. When he entered Green Mountain in seventh grade, “I was using the female bathroom because, I really don’t know, I was still kind of back and forth about my identity,” Mr. Jackson said. “This year is the year I started using the men’s bathroom, because I already felt like way more comfortable in who I was. ” There were practical issues. When he had his period, he wondered if he should revert to the girls’ bathroom, because there was no place to throw away his used tampons. But he had started feeling like an intruder in the girls’ bathroom, and the single bathrooms were so far out of the way it was hard to get to class on time. So he stuck with the boys’ bathroom. “I use a stall, and I wait till everybody’s gone to get up and leave,” Mr. Jackson said. “The guys, they look at me like I’m some kind of freak, or they’re concerned or scared. ” The only classmate who talks to him when he sees him in the bathroom is his childhood friend Connor Rose, a leader of the school’s   alliance. Mr. Jackson feels safe in the boys’ bathroom at school, he said, whereas in public places, like Dunkin’ Donuts, he is afraid to go to the men’s restroom for fear of being attacked by straight men. He said he understood the concerns of some of his classmates. “There probably are some transgender people that are bad people, just like there are probably a whole bunch of gay people or straight people that are bad,” he said. He had been using the boys’ bathrooms for less than a month  —   trying to go in during lunch or recess when he would not be noticed  —   when someone complained. No one knows for sure who complained, but a widespread rumor holds that it was a middle schooler. Hank Mauti, a school board member and retired sawmill worker from Andover, said he wondered why Mr. Jackson would feel compelled to use a boys’ bathroom when there were six     bathrooms in the school. “What about the little boy that reported it?” asked Mr. Mauti’s wife, Wanda, repeating the rumor, in an interview in their home, under a trophy of a moose that Mr. Mauti shot. “As far as I can tell, his discomfort hasn’t been addressed. ” Tom Ferenc, the principal, called Mr. Jackson’s mother the night of the complaint and told her that he was going to ask A J to use the   bathroom, she recalled. The next Monday, A J and about 30 supporters walked out of the school in protest. Three days later, the district announced the new policy. Mr. Ferenc was happy to get some “clarity” about the proper policy, as he put it, and proud of his school. “It reminded me of Rosa Parks, honestly,” he said. Besides the “Straight Pride”   counterprotest, the decision has set off a storm of discussion, sometimes nasty on both sides, on Facebook. Also, someone taped a sign to a trash can this week that said, “Reserved for Mariah and Tanner,” referring to Mariah Lique and Mr. Bischofberger, two student leaders of the counterprotest, who are dating. Ms. Lique said that she and Mr. Bischofberger were just saying what a lot of other students think but are afraid to say because if they did, “you’d get hated. ” “We’re considered more conservative,” she said. “Because we’re outspoken,” Mr. Bischofberger interjected, finishing her sentence. Two of their favorite teachers are openly gay, they said, and the students misunderstand where they are coming from. “They see us as   …    ” Mr. Bischofberger began, “hating their sexuality,” Ms. Lique finished. But that is not true, they said. Part of what troubles them is that Mr. Jackson is still anatomically female. “Autumn, A J, whatever you call them, hasn’t had any hormone or sex change yet,” Mr. Bischofberger said. “This opens up opportunities for other kids to do stuff they’re not supposed to. ” While everyone seems to sympathize with the gay students, they seem to have a license to make him feel ostracized and attacked, and it hurts, Mr. Bischofberger said: “They’re calling me a cisgendered, hypocritical homophobe. ”": "20344",
    "ISTANBUL  —   They were used to stalk Russian helicopters in Afghanistan, and the United States has worked hard to keep them out of chaotic Syria. But now Kurdish guerrillas battling Turkey’s security forces may now have   missiles  —   an acquisition analysts say will seriously challenge Turkish air power and potentially intensify fighting in the region. On Saturday, media affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) a leftist militant group battling the Turkish state, posted a video purporting to show a fighter downing a Cobra attack helicopter with a     system  —   or MANPADS  —   in the mountains of southeastern Turkey on Friday morning. Arms observers said this is the first time they have seen PKK fighters successfully using MANPADS in their   fight against the Turks. About four minutes into the video, the fighter, clad in camouflage fatigues, crouches on a verdant hillside with the weapons system on his shoulder. When the launcher locks on its target  —   a helicopter whirring noisily on the horizon  —   the fighter stands to fire. The   missile swoops through the air and strikes the Cobra’s tail, sending the aircraft spinning and eventually crashing into the mountainside. Turkish authorities on Friday had attributed the helicopter crash in Hakkari province to an unknown technical failure. The chopper had been dispatched, however, after the militants staged an attack that killed six Turkish soldiers in the area. ”There have been rumors of them having MANPADS in their arsenal, but nothing concrete,” said Kyle Glen,   of Conflict News, a website that collects information and images from conflict zones around the world. ”This is the first actual video evidence of their use inside Turkey that I have seen in several years,” he said. ”Turkey will have to escalate, which means the PKK will escalate in return.   …     [It’s a] bloody cycle.” The PKK has successfully used MANPADS before, including two 1997 strikes that downed two Turkish helicopters in northern Iraq, according to Charles Lister at the Middle East Institute in Washington. ”There have been more recent alleged uses,” Lister said, ”but minimally documented.” Turkey and the PKK have been locked in conflict for more than 40 years over autonomy for the   Kurdish minority. The Turkish government has long seen the Kurds, who maintain a separate culture and speak a different language, as a threat to the ethnic purity of the Turkish state. The PKK, however, has carried out a number of bombings against both civilians and security forces throughout the conflict. Last year, a    truce between the two sides broke down, and the war reignited. Since then, PKK and other Kurdish guerrillas have killed hundreds of Turkish soldiers in clashes and other attacks, including suicide bombings. But the use of a    missile  —   which arms experts said is likely a   9K38 Igla  —   is a new and troubling development. It’s unclear where the militants, who maintain bases in both Turkey and Iraq, would have obtained the weapon system. But former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein was known to have acquired the same   system in the 1980s, as did Libyan strongman Moammar Gaddafi. The successful attack ”is a game changer” and ”could lead to further escalation in the region,” Aykan Erdemir, senior fellow at the D. C.  Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, posted on Twitter. Turkish officials did not respond to request for comment.": "211961",
    "(CNN) An Iraqi man watching his first snowfall in his new American hometown was shot and killed by an unknown assailant, according to Dallas police. Authorities have stepped up patrols in the neighborhood where Ahmed   lived    and died    in their effort to find out who killed the    early Thursday, as he and his brother stood in the parking lot of his apartment complex watching the snow.  ’s wife was with them taking photos.  Dallas police spokesman Jeff Cotner said   who recently immigrated to the U. S. had never seen snow and ”just like all of us, a pretty snowfall brings the child out in us.”  There is ”extreme heartache . .. and no shortage of sadness for this beautiful young man who had just come to this country 20 days ago,” said Alia Salem, executive director of the Council on   Relations in the Dallas and Fort Worth area. CAIR became involved in the case immediately after the shooting, according to Salem, because of ”a heightened sense of awareness with regard to hate crimes against Muslims.”  Salem said the Muslim community wanted to know whether the shooting death was random or whether    was targeted. Police say they have no indication so far that it was a hate crime. When shooting broke out,   cried ”I’m hit!” according to Cotner, basing that on statements from witnesses and the victim’s relatives. He ran to his apartment nearby and died a few hours later. Police did not say where   was struck or how many times he was shot.  Some residents reported seeing two to four men enter the apartment complex on foot through a vehicle gate before the shooting, according to Cotner. He said there was no interaction between the men and   and his family. In    soundless surveillance video, one person who appears to be carrying a rifle is seen running just ahead of a second person, Dallas police Officer Monica Cordova said. The second person is shown walking at a slower pace, holding what appears to be a handgun in his right hand. Approximately 13 seconds later, another person comes into view and passes by the camera, followed by a fourth individual who is walking, she said.  From the vantage point of the camera, it is difficult to make out any of the features of the suspects or even the gender, although police have said they are looking for four black males.  Witnesses say multiple shots were fired from what is believed to be a rifle. Cotner said police are conducting tests to find out whether more than one rifle was used in the shooting, but he said he could not reveal the make or model of the weapon.   Cotner said Friday that other than that, police have little to go on. ”We can’t solve this crime alone,” he said. Authorities are appealing to the public to contact them with any information that might help the investigation. North Texas Crime Stoppers is offering a $5, 000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and an indictment, police said.  Salem is encouraging anyone with information about the shooting to share it.  She said there are online campaigns underway to help raise funds for the family’s expenses, as well as an effort to raise additional funds to contribute to the reward.": "61350",
    "(CNN) The only man charged in the 2010 disappearance and death of honor student Phylicia Barnes has been freed by a judge in Baltimore.  On Monday, Judge Addison Howard granted a motion of acquittal for Michael Johnson because of insufficient evidence. Russell Barnes, Phylicia Barnes’ father, said the ruling was heartbreaking. ”I feel like I got run over by a train,” he said. The body of the    Barnes was found floating in a Maryland river in spring 2011. Authorities said she was found without clothes and with no ”overt” signs of wounds or injuries.  The teen had been visiting her   in Baltimore. She said she was going out to get something to eat and maybe a haircut when she left the residence. About a year after her body was found, police arrested Johnson, the  ’s  .  Johnson was convicted of second degree murder in January 2013. But his attorneys successfully argued that he should have a new trial because the prosecution withheld evidence about a witness who linked Johnson to the killing, according to the judge’s order that summarized the case. Last month, the second trial ended in a mistrial because the jury was allowed to hear information in recordings that should have been redacted, the court order stated.  Defense lawyers filed a motion for acquittal. The judge’s order said there was plenty of circumstantial evidence against Johnson, including that he was the last person known to see Barnes and that a witness watched him sweating as he carried an object in a tote down the apartment stairs on the day she disappeared.  However, the judge wrote, ”there was insufficient evidence when taken as a whole” to convict Johnson on a charge of   murder.  Prosecutors tweeted a statement saying they disagree with the judge’s decision and will appeal the ruling. Defense lawyer Kay Beehler issued a statement saying, ”This case was a tragedy for everyone in the Barnes and Johnson families. Ms. Barnes was a lovely, vibrant young woman.  However, Mr. Johnson has maintained his innocence from Day One of this entire case, and we are very thankful that justice was done. ” Johnson left jail and was met by reporters on the street. ”It feels great to be out,” he said. Russell Barnes said he’ll keep working to put Johnson behind bars. ”We just can’t let this go,” he said. ”We have to see justice for Phylicia. We’re just going to pursue . .. the same gentlemen, a child killer who’s on the streets of Baltimore.”": "60648",

    "Simon Cowell is returning to American television as a judge on the 11th season of “America’s Got Talent”  —   which Cowell created in 2006 (it spawned “Britain’s Got Talent,” on which Cowell is a judge). He’ll join host Nick Cannon and fellow judges Heidi Klum, Mel B. and Howie Mandel when the new season of “AGT” premieres May 31. Cowell, 56, was last seen in prime time here on “The X Factor,” the Fox version of his British hit which ended in December 2013 after three (mostly disappointing) seasons. Cowell talked to The Post about his role on “AGT,” what went wrong with “The X Factor” and his reputation as the “nasty” judge. [Laughs] Well, years ago, I had a conversation with NBC about doing this show and they offered me a really good deal overall. At the time I was on “Idol” and it didn’t feel like the right thing to do. NBC always had these conversations with me and the question was not if, but when. Howard [Stern, who left “AGT”] was doing good on the show and it was always his choice whether he wanted to stay or go, but we never knew year to year. He didn’t like the traveling, or whatever it was. Any thoughts I had about being the boss was soon shattered on Day One. These four know each other so well and I felt like the new boy  —   and almost like I had to prove myself. It’s obviously one of our biggest shows so I sometimes came in for the finals, or if I didn’t come in for the finals I watched them. I’d go down to the tapings sometimes and sit with the team. The only thing I felt was missing [was] I thought we could do better with the music acts. That wasn’t our strong point. We’ve had one successful singer over the years, Jackie Evancho, and I think with the “Got Talent” brand, even though it’s a variety show, I still think the music acts are important. That was my number one mission: To see if I could attract better music acts to the show. And we do have better music acts this season, that’s for sure. It was a mess. First of all, we should’ve waited for “Idol” to end and then launch “X Factor” in its spot. That would’ve been the smart thing   …     not having the shows on at the same time   …     In hindsight, we panicked   …     and I opened my big mouth when I said we’d get 20 million viewers [a week]. When I look back on it, some stupid decisions were made. But I’m a big boy. It’s a learning curve   …     And we got [singing group] Fifth Harmony from Season 2, so we found some stars. I don’t think you change as a person. When I look back at early [“American Idol”] clips   …     what people do forget is that I was different from the other judges  —   I was British and said what I’d always said. I thought it was funny, [that I was] not being mean. I think people also forget that what I did mainly in those early days was I found stars, whether it was Kelly Clarkson or Carrie Underwood. And I think people think more about the ‘mean’ things I said when I was really being positive and trying to help people and spot talent. That’s what I’m most proud of. No. I remember once [in 2007]   …     when I was in trouble for   I thought it was funny but, my God, did I get it in the neck.

    "Obama used a presidential proclamation to expand the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument off the coast of Hawaii by over 400, 000 square miles. The preserve now stretches 582, 578 square miles, the world’s largest marine protected area.  ”The expansion provides critical protections for more than 7, 000 marine species . .. [and] will allow scientists to monitor and explore the impacts of climate change on these fragile ecosystems,” the White House said in a statement, citing the support of Sen. Brian Schatz and ”prominent Native Hawaiian leaders.”  But the decision drew sharp criticism from the fishing industry and even fellow Democrats, as it will drastically expand the area where commercial fishing and drilling is banned.  Former Democratic Gov. George Ariyoshi said at a rally last month that it came down to the question of who actually owned the ocean. “The ocean belongs to us,” Ariyoshi reportedly said. “We ought to be the ones who decide what kind of use to make of the ocean. ” Representatives from the fishing industry warn the move will increase prices and imports, The Honolulu Star Advertiser reported. All commercial extraction activities will be prohibited within the area, though   fishing is allowed by permit.  The regional council that manages U. S. waters in the Pacific Islands said the decision ”serves a political legacy” rather than a conservation benefit. ”Closing 60 percent of Hawaii’s waters to commercial fishing, when science is telling us that it will not lead to more productive local fisheries, makes no sense,” said Edwin Ebiusi Jr. chairman of the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council. ”Today is a sad day in the history of Hawaii’s fisheries and a negative blow to our local food security.” The Pew Charitable Trusts, which supported the expansion, gave an idea of how big the area truly is, saying more than three Californias could be squeezed into it:   How big is Hawaii’s new expanded marine monument? THIS BIG.  https:  .  #MahaloObama pic. twitter.  According to the Star Advertiser, the idea was proposed to Obama by Native Hawaiian leaders, who argued the waters in the area contained sharks and large predatory fish that have been overfished in other areas and were in need of protection. The move has also been backed by environmentalists and some scientists.  Other Democrats praised Obama’s action, with Sen. Brian Schatz,   calling it “one of the most important actions an American president has ever taken for the health of the oceans. ” With the announcement, Obama will have created or expanded 26 national monuments. The administration said Obama has protected more acreage through national monument designations than any other president. Obama will travel to Midway Atoll, within the monument, on Thursday as part of a visit to Hawaii next week. His visit will come after he addresses leaders from the Pacific Island Conference of Leaders and the IUCN World Conservation Congress. The monument was first designated by President George W. Bush in 2006. The announcement came after Obama used his executive authority to create the National Park Service’s newest national monument at Katahdin Woods and Waters in Maine. The new monument was created as part of the 100th anniversary of the creation of the National Park Service. The White House said the monument will protect 87, 500 acres and will bolster the forest’s resilience against the impact of climate change.  The monument’s creation, though, was opposed by state lawmakers and critics who warn it will hinder efforts to rebuild a   economy in the region.  “President Obama is once again taking unilateral action against the will of the people, this time the citizens of rural Maine,” Republican Gov. Paul LePage said. “The Legislature passed a resolution opposing a National Monument in the North Woods, members of Maine’s Congressional delegation opposed it and local citizens voted against it repeatedly.” The move also was opposed by Sen. Susan Collins and Rep. Bruce Poliquin, both Republicans.  “Our local job creators —  not Washington bureaucrats —  know best how to use our working forests and provide proper access for industries to create more jobs including those in the outdoor recreation businesses, like snowmobiling, hunting, rafting, camping and so on,” Poliquin said in a statement.

    "Samsung, working with consumer safety agencies in South Korea, the US, and China, has temporarily halted sales and production of the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone after reports that replacement devices have caught fire, Yonhap News reported. The company has also asked all owners of both original and replacement Galaxy Note7s to power the phones down and return them. A Samsung spokesperson told BuzzFeed News, “We are temporarily adjusting the Galaxy Note7 production schedule in order to take further steps to ensure quality and safety matters. ” US phone carriers ATT and   stopped selling the phone and declined to issue replacement Note7s for previously sold phones, the Wall Street Journal reported. Both carriers are instead offering refunds or different devices in exchange for returned Note7s. On October 10, Samsung asked “all carriers and retail partners globally to stop sales and exchanges of the Galaxy Note7 while the investigation is taking place. ” Responding to ATT and  ’s decisions, a Samsung spokesperson said, “We are working diligently with authorities and third party experts and will share findings when we have completed the investigation. ” The spokesperson continued, “Even though there are a limited number of reports, we want to reassure customers that we are taking every report seriously. If we determine a product safety issue exists, Samsung will take immediate steps approved by the CPSC to resolve the situation. ” Air carriers have been advising passengers to power down their Note7s during flights for weeks now, but in response to Samsung’s October 10 decision, the Federal Aviation Administration made official recommendations for aircraft passengers “to power down, and not use, charge, or stow in checked baggage, any Samsung Galaxy Note7 devices. ” Last month, Samsung issued a global recall of 2. 5 million Note7s, including 1 million in the US, after a number of reports that the phones’ batteries were overheating and causing them to explode. The electronics manufacturer offered replacement phones to buyers with defective ones, but some users reported that even these burst into flames as well. The Note7 hit the market on Aug. 19, but faced a recall in the US less than a month later on Sept. 15 after nearly 100 reports of the devices catching fire or exploding, some with dramatic results. Replacement phones arrived in the US on Sept. 21 but were met with resistance after a Southwest Airlines flight was grounded because of a smoking Note7. Samsung lost $25 billion in market value due to the multiple failures of the Note7, but shares have recently rebounded to an   high. The Wall Street Journal reported that Samsung’s operating profit will rise to roughly $7 billion in Q3 2016, which includes recall costs of $1 billion. Note7 owners looking to return their phone can start the process here. UPDATE: This story has been updated to reflect Samsung’s request that carriers and sellers cease sales of the Note7 and to include the FAA’s recommendations.": "111735",
    "The most heated fight at the Rio Olympics lasted just a minute and four seconds. It was a battle between good and evil, the fair and unfair, the clean and the cheaters, with a hint of a Cold War twist.    The conflict: a   breaststroke battle between two swimmers, American Lilly King and Russian Yulia Efimova. In Sunday’s qualifying race, King and Efimova came in first and second place, respectively, with times   of a second apart. But as they entered the aquatic center on Monday to swim in the final, there was a lot more riding on their matchup than an Olympic medal. Efimova’s reputation was tainted by controversy, as she had previously failed two drug tests and served a   suspension. In the end, King defeated Efimova and clinched the gold medal. But her victory was so much more than a personal win.    Who is Yulia Efimova? Efimova’s story of athletic success is marred by cheating  —   namely, positive drug tests. Efimova is one of the top swimmers in the world in breaststroke, winning world championships in the   and   events since she made her debut at the Beijing Olympics in 2008. At the London games in 2012, she won bronze in the   breaststroke.    In 2013, Efimova tested positive for DHEA, a banned steroid hormone considered an anabolic agent by the World   Agency. She served a   ban for the substance. Then, earlier this year, Efimova tested positive for meldonium, the substance that Maria Sharapova tested positive for. A month ago, Efimova wasn’t even supposed to be swimming at the Olympics.    ”She was one of seven Russian swimmers barred from the games who had either failed doping tests or were named in the World   Agency’s investigation into   doping,” the Los Angeles Times reported, explaining the International Swimming Federation’s second ban on Efimova But this past week, Efimova was reinstated, much to the dismay of both swimming fans and fellow athletes. Why do people hate Efimova? On Sunday, August 7, Efimova swam in the   breaststroke preliminary heat. After qualifying for the final with the   time, Efimova was booed. She raised her finger in a ”number one” sign after the race. It was a surreal scene, the type that just doesn’t happen at the Olympics.    Essentially, lots of people  —   her competitors, NBC’s commentators, fans  —   believe Efimova doesn’t deserve to be at the Olympics. In their eyes, she got away with cheating. She can’t shake the lingering specter that her qualifying time might be due to doping. And what about the women who don’t dope that she’s already beaten in races? ”You know, you’re shaking your finger number one and you’ve been caught for drug cheating,” King said in an interview with NBC after taking the top spot in the   qualifier. While waiting for her heat to begin, she watched Efimova’s semifinal and wagged her finger at the swimmer. ”I’m just not a fan,” King added. As SB Nation explains, Efimova could have been facing a lifetime ban for her second doping violation. But she was given a sliver of grace. ”Because she tested positive soon after the drug was added to the list of prohibited drugs in January, Efimova was cleared to participate in the Olympics in July,” the site reported. ”The International Swimming Federation allowed her and many others back in the pool on the basis that it was unclear just how long meldonium stays in the body.” Efimova’s history of cheating put an ugly tint on Monday’s final  —   making it so much more than just a competition about who can swim the fastest. It became about the integrity of the sport. Efimova became the embodiment of the systemic doping in the Russian athletic system. And Lilly King became the only person who could conceivably beat her. The   breaststroke final was amazing and lived up to the hype  Even with all the stakes and beef present in the women’s   breaststroke final, it lived up to expectations. Thanks to their very close qualifying times, King and Efimova were placed in lanes right next to each other. King stared Efimova down as the two waited to begin the race. When Efimova’s name was announced, the crowd let loose a flurry of boos.    King was slightly ahead of Efimova for about 75 percent of the race. But Efimova has great closing speed and pushed King at the very end  —   King really had to work to hold onto her scrap of a lead and ended up finishing with a time of 1 minute 4. 93 seconds  —   good enough for gold and a half a second faster than Efimova. Efimova had been silent leading up to the race, and didn’t outright address the doping allegations until after she won silver. In a   interview she intimated that the first doping violation was her fault, but this second was out of her control. ”I have once made mistakes and been banned,” Efimova said. ”The second time it was not my mistake.” After the race, NBC’s Michele Tafoya asked King if she was trying to send a message with her win. ”I hoped I did, that we can compete clean and still win at the Olympic Games,” King said. When King beat Efimova, she slapped the water in between them in triumph. She shot over a stare. And Efimova didn’t raise her finger.    ”There is a way to become the best and do it the right way,” King said at press conference after her race. Efimova races again in the   breaststroke on Wednesday.": "201570",
    "Americans who voted for Donald J. Trump continue to approve of him as president, even though he supported a health care bill that would disproportionately hurt them. Highly educated professionals tend to lean Democratic, even though Republican tax policies would probably leave more money in their pockets. Why do people vote against their economic interests? The answer, experts say, is partisanship. Party affiliation has become an   identity that outweighs the details of specific policies. “Partisan identification is bigger than anything the party does,” said Frances Lee, a professor at the University of Maryland who wrote a book on partisan polarization. Rather, it stems from something much more fundamental: people’s idea of who they are. For American voters, party affiliation is a way to express a bundle of identities. “It more or less boils down to how you see the conflicts in American society, and which groups you see as representing you,” Ms. Lee said. “That often means race, and religion, and ethnicity  —   those are the social groups that underlie party identification. ” That process is not necessarily conscious. “There’s sort of an embarrassment about being a partisan,” Ms. Lee said. “It’s seen as admitting to a bias. ” That often leads people to say that they are independent, she said, but in fact most voters consistently lean toward one of the parties. As partisanship grows, switching parties has become rare for voters. So has   in which voters support different parties in presidential and   races. But when people do switch, it is often because they feel that the other party has become a better representative of the groups that they identify with. Preliminary data suggests that is what happened with the Democratic voters who voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, said Lilliana Mason, a professor at the University of Maryland who studies partisanship. “Older voters who scored high on racial resentment were much more likely to switch from Obama to Trump,” Ms. Mason said. She believes that he successfully made a pitch to what she calls “white male identity politics,” convincing older,   white voters that he would represent their interests. Economic status, it turns out, is not so important in partisanship. “Class in American politics, rich vs. poor, is just not a very good predictor of party identification,” Ms. Lee said. For both rich and poor Americans, other identities take precedence. “There are plenty of rich Democrats,” Ms. Lee pointed out. “There are plenty of Republican politicians who represent poor districts. ” That’s not to say that the parties don’t have major differences on economic matters. But, experts say, those differences matter more to elites than to    voters. That is why, for instance, Mr. Trump was able to win the G. O. P. nomination even though he broke with Republican ideology on economic matters like trade protectionism. His arguments played to white   voter identity, and that turned out to be a successful strategy even though it alienated many of the party’s leaders. But how voters choose their party is only one element of the story. The overlapping identities that underlie partisanship are also driving a form of polarization so strong that it is now essentially impossible for politicians, or the public, to avoid its influence. In 2009, when Ms. Mason was still a graduate student, she had a “eureka” moment about American politics. “I stumbled across this social psychology article from 2002 that talked about what happens when multiple identities line up together,” she said in an interview. “There was all this social psychology literature about how it increases bias. ” The same, she realized, was true of partisan identity. Everyone has multiple identities: racial, religious, professional, ideological and more. But while those multiple identities might once have pushed people in different partisan directions  —   think of the conservative Democrats of old in the South or all the liberal Republicans in the Northeast  —   today it’s more common to line up behind one party. A white conservative who lives in a rural area and is an evangelical Christian is likely to feel that the Republican Party is the best representative of all of those separate identities, for instance. An   liberal who lives in a city and works in a professional job is likely to feel the same way about the Democratic Party. Can this explain why American politics have become so polarized over the last several decades? Starting in 1980, the National Election Study, a   survey that tracks Americans’ political preferences, showed that Republicans and Democrats were growing apart: Each reported increasingly negative opinions of the opposing party. And other data showed that polarization was seeping into nonpolitical arenas, making Republicans and Democrats less likely to marry or be friends. Ms. Mason decided to make that the focus of her doctoral thesis, and found much to support her hypothesis: Americans’ overlapping political identities were driving extreme polarization. When multiple identities line up together, all pushing people toward the same party, partisan identity becomes a kind of umbrella for many different characteristics that people feel are important to them. That magnifies people’s attachment to their team. And that, in turn, raises the stakes of conflict with the opposing “team,” Ms. Mason found. In every electoral contest or partisan disagreement, she explained, people now feel that they are fighting for many elements of who they are: their racial identity, professional identity, religious identity, even geographical identity. “The way I think of it is, imagine that the World Series also affected the N. C. A. A. and the Super Bowl and every other team you care about,” she said. “So as our identities line up with party identity, politics becomes more and more consequential. ” That may have been the key to Mr. Trump’s success in the 2016 election, she believes. “With Trump, if you can point to one brilliant thing he did, it’s that he as a politician, kind of for the first time, said ‘we’re losers.’ ” Social psychology research has shown that the best way to get people to defend their identity is to threaten it. By saying “we don’t win anymore  —   we’re losers  —   and I’m going to make us win again,” Ms. Mason said, Mr. Trump’s pitch to voters both created the sense of threat and promised a defense: a winning political strategy for the age of identity politics. The result of those overlapping, powerful identities is that Americans have become more willing to defend their party against any perceived threat, and to demand that their politicians take uncompromisingly partisan stands. But while those demands can affect policy, they are rooted in emotional attachments, not policy goals. “When we talk about being a sports fan, there’s no policy content related to that,” Ms. Mason said. “It’s just this sense of connection. And that’s powerful! It makes people cry. It makes people riot. There doesn’t really have to be any policy content for people to get riled up, and to be extremely committed. ” Ms. Mason, along with Leonie Huddy, a professor at Stony Brook University, and Lene Aaroe of Aarhus University in Denmark, conducted an experiment to test the importance of policy. They found that people responded much more strongly to threats or support to their party than to particular issues. They became angry at perceived threats to their party, and enthusiastic about its perceived successes. Their responses to policy gains and losses, by contrast, were much more muted. That helps explain why Mr. Trump’s support among Republican voters remains quite high, even though the first few months of his presidency have been plagued by scandals and political setbacks, and even though his overall national approval ratings are now very low. He has been careful to recast every potential scandal and policy struggle as a battle against the Democrats and other outside groups. Mr. Trump has insisted, for instance, that the F. B. I. investigation into his campaign staffers’ contacts with Russia is meaningless “fake news,” and that the real issue is whether President Obama wiretapped him before the election. (There is no evidence thus far that any such wiretapping took place.) And when the Republican health care bill failed despite Mr. Trump’s support, he at first blamed Democrats. Republican voters may not be happy with everything the president does  —   many, for instance, have told reporters that they would prefer him to tweet less often, and others worry about how his health care plans will affect their families  —   but he is still the captain of their “team. ” Abandoning him would mean betraying tribal allegiance, and all of the identities that underlie it.": "20094",
    "On what the International Olympic Committee president referred to as a “historic day,” the IOC announced that for the first time ever a team of refugees will participate in the Olympics in 2016. [President Thomas Bach stated that because the refugee athletes “have no home, no team, no flag, no national anthem,” the establishment of a refugee team will “give them a home in the Olympic village together with all the athletes around the world. ”  Bach went on to state in an official IOC press release directed to the “international community” that the refugee team “will be a symbol of hope for all the refugees in our world, and will make the world better aware of the magnitude of the crisis  …     Refugees are our fellow human beings and are an enrichment to Society. ” The refugee team will consist of ten athletes —  six men and four women —  and will compete in swimming, judo, and athletics, reported Reuters. Like all the other national teams, the refugees will stay in the athletes’ village. They will march into the Olympic stadium in Rio de Janeiro in the penultimate position just before the host team of Brazil at the opening ceremony. “The Olympic anthem will be played in their honor, the Olympic flag will lead them into the stadium,” Bach stated. “They will show to the world that despite the unimaginable tragedies they have faced, anyone can contribute to society through talent, skills and the strength of human spirit. ” Also, a group of five refugee coaches and five other   refugee officials will participate in the Rio games, which, according to the IOC, will aid in shining a “spotlight on the world refugee crisis. ”": "35076",
    "DC Protestor ”Rape Melania” Less than a week after the 2016 presidential election, a Trump supporter named Alan Beck tweeted two photographs of an   protest in Washington, DC, in which a hooded figure held aloft a sign reading “Rape Melania. ” The images went viral, and the sign  —   as well as Twitter  —   drew swift condemnation from news outlets both right and left. Some Trump supporters took the sign as confirmation that the passionate national opposition to the   was ultimately anarchic and violent. (Many of these supporters had drawn a similar conclusion about the Black Lives Matter movement.) “The current surge in the left’s propensity toward violence and mayhem should surprise no one,” wrote one InfoWars commenter. And to some Clinton supporters, the sign was a gutting refutation of Michelle Obama’s “when they go low, we go high” speech and a reminder that Trump rallies didn’t hold a monopoly on menace. But, BuzzFeed News has learned, the “Rape Melania” sign was not the work of an   protester at all. Instead, according to sources, it was the brainchild of a group of Trump supporters led by Jack Posobiec, one of the organizers of the controversial DeploraBall inauguration party and a prominent figure in the   internet. Furthermore, as shown by a series of Posobiec’s text messages obtained by BuzzFeed News and confirmed by a source who collaborated with Posobiec, the sign was the culmination of a disinformation campaign by Posobiec and others intended to paint the   rallies as violent and out of control. In a phone call with BuzzFeed News, Posobiec denied that the texts were sent by him and said that it was likely they had been photoshopped. He also denied having any involvement in the campaign. BuzzFeed News reviewed the texts on a source’s iPhone in Signal, the secure texting app, and the Signal messages allegedly from Posobiec came from the same phone number on which BuzzFeed News talked to Posobiec. At 9:59 p. m. on Nov. 10, Posobiec posted a video to Twitter of an   protester yelling “Assassinate that nigga. ” In a 10:30 p. m. text message that same night, Posobiec claimed that he’d started an “assassinate Trump” chant to goad protesters into copying him, with the intention of filming them: Though the video didn’t go viral, it was picked up by Russia Today and some conservative blogs. In the same text message conversation, Posobiec and his collaborator brainstormed other incendiary things to chant, including “Rape Melania. ” Two days later, in another text obtained by BuzzFeed News, Posobiec discussed with another collaborator his plan to “discredit” an   protest by infiltrating it “with the bad signs. ” According to a source, it is Posobiec himself holding the “Rape Melania” sign in the photographs published by Beck  —   a charge Posobiec also denies. After posting the photographs, Beck uploaded a   YouTube video of himself and Posobiec sitting in a car near the protest, titled “  Protester Created’R4PE MELANIA!’ Sign and The Rest of the Protesters Do Nothing. ” The following day, a collaborator texted Posobiec a screenshot of Twitter’s trending topics, of which “Rape Melania” was number three. Posobiec responded, “Woah!” Today, the former DeploraBall organizer Tim Gionet  —   who goes by Baked Alaska on Twitter  —   accused Posobiec of making the sign. . @MAGA3X I have a question. Your organizer @JackPosobiec was the one who made the ”Rape Melania” sign, do you support this behavior? Posobiec, who is the special projects director of a grassroots organization called Citizens for Trump, has been at the center of several flareups of the new right media in recent weeks. In November, Posobiec was thrown out of Comet Ping Pong, the Washington, DC, pizza parlor made infamous by #pizzagate, for filming a children’s birthday party. And in December, Posobiec started the viral #DumpStarWars hashtag after claiming that Rogue One contained   scenes.": "100036",
    "The globalists in world politics and international finance are celebrating a somber occasion in Davos, media reports indicate, as their influence on the global stage is waning rapidly in the wake of the U. K. referendum to leave the European Union and the U. S. election of Donald Trump to the presidency. [“The global economy is in better shape than it’s been in years. Stock markets are booming, oil prices are on the rise again and the risks of a rapid economic slowdown in China, a major source of concern a year ago, have eased,” Reuters’ Noah Barkin writes from Davos, Switzerland, at the annual summit of the world’s elite. “And yet, as political leaders, CEOs and top bankers make their annual trek up the Swiss Alps to the World Economic Forum in Davos, the mood is anything but celebratory. Beneath the veneer of optimism over the economic outlook lurks acute anxiety about an increasingly toxic political climate and a deep sense of uncertainty surrounding the U. S. presidency of Donald Trump, who will be inaugurated on the final day of the forum. ”  The Sydney Morning Herald’s Clancy Yeates has a piece detailing how this year’s World Economic Forum at Davos —  at which Chinese president Xi Jinping will speak, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel will not —  there is a focus on the “backlash” voters worldwide have delivered against globalization. “Chief executive pay has become a powerful symbol of the widening gap between the winners and losers created by globalisation, and boards must put more focus on justifying the bonuses they pay executives amid a backlash against   policies,” Yeates writes. “That is the view of the chairman of the Australian Institute of Company Directors, Elizabeth Proust, one of the Australian business leaders attending the powerful summit in Switzerland this week. The annual meeting of the global economic and political elite, in a town in the Swiss Alps, takes place against a backdrop of growing inequality in many countries, seen as a key driver for   political shocks including Brexit and Donald Trump’s win. ” The globalists at Davos still don’t seem to fully understand what is happening, as the World Economic Forum’s website published a column from Robert Muggah of the Igarape Institute with a headline stating boldly: “Populism is poison. ” He and   Misha Glenny, a writer and broadcaster, advocate for “plural cities” to defeat populism. Populism is poison. Plural cities are the antidote, says Robert Muggah https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   World Economic Forum (@wef) January 15, 2017,  “If cities are to defeat populism, they need to know what it is,” Muggah and Glenny write. “According to Princeton’s   Muller, at the core of populism is a profound rejection of pluralism. It is animated by two basic ideas  —   an opposition to diversity and a rejection of the   establishment. Populists contend that outsiders threaten the national way of life and that ‘the people’ need to exclude outsiders. The antithesis of the people is, oddly, migrants. ” Populists aren’t likely to slow their winning streak any time soon. Globalization is on the decline everywhere in the world, from Guatemala —  which elected a television comedian, Jimmy Morales, as its president back in late 2015 —  to Italy, whose recent referendum led to the resignation of prime minister Matteo Renzi. Obviously, America just elected Donald Trump and the British voted to leave the European Union. French and German presidential elections in 2017 threaten to see the potential rise of   Marine Le Pen and the possible demise of   Angela Merkel all in one fell swoop.  It’s unclear if Merkel will go down, or if Le Pen will win in France. But that we’re even at this point where it’s possible is remarkable in and of itself. Le Pen spent the past few days in New York City, making a surprise appearance at Trump Tower hoping for a meeting which she didn’t get with the  . Merkel, meanwhile, is clearly scared enough of a potential electoral loss in 2017 that she’s skipping her regular appearance in Davos at the World Economic Forum so as to avoid providing populist opponents of her globalism with any ammunition heading into this year. It comes on the heels of her pledge to ban burkhas in her speech announcing she intends to stand for   a complete reversal from a leading open borders advocate who’s perhaps singlehandedly overseen the importation of millions of Muslims into mainland Europe including Germany. The New York Times’ Michael J. de la Merced and Russell Goldman detail how the World Economic Forum has, for decades, been the exclusive annual   for the world’s political, financial and cultural elites —  a place where they gather together, and celebrate themselves. “The annual meeting runs on a tiered system of colored badges denoting just how important one is, or is not,” Merced and Goldman write. “White badges are for attendees able to attend any official event and make full use of the forum’s facilities. Orange badges are reserved for the 500 journalists who cover the forum, but are not allowed at some parties. Other badges, like purple ones, denote technical or support staff and limit their holders to a few areas. If that system were not complicated enough, local hotels like the Belvedere and the InterContinental often sell their own badges to the bankers and consultants who descend upon Davos  —   but not the forum itself  —   to strike deals and chat up clients. These souls camp out at the hotels, renting rooms for business meetings by day and soiree hopping at night. ” While most of the official events are things like lectures, speeches, panels and discussions, the Times writers highlight some of the “more esoteric attractions” like “a simulation of a refugee’s experience, where Davos attendees crawl on their hands and knees and pretend to flee from advancing armies. ” There are also lots of parties and schmoozing behind the scenes, where the elites bond together. “There are several official cocktail receptions, but the action really lies in a galaxy of events hosted by corporations. Some are small, intimate dinners that feature the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio and Bono,” Merced and Goldman write. “Others are dazzling affairs: JPMorgan Chase, for example, has previously taken over the Kirchner Museum Davos for drinks with its chief executive, Jamie Dimon, and Tony Blair, the former British prime minister. Google’s annual party at the InterContinental Hotel has become the hottest ticket in town. The investor Anthony Scaramucci, now an adviser to Donald J. Trump, for years has hosted a reception at the famed Hotel Europe featuring a sometimes   list of   Champagne and Bordeaux red wine. A more recent    is hosted by Salesforce. com, a business software maker, whose chief, Marc Benioff, is one of the forum’s most ardent boosters. Last year’s Salesforce party included Mr. Benioff flying in scores of fresh flower leis and a band from Hawaii, as Eric Schmidt of Google and other tech notables danced in a corner. Several years ago, Sean Parker of Napster and Facebook fame, hosted an    gathering that featured stuffed animal heads shooting laser beams out of their eyes. And the Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska has thrown opulent gatherings at a nearby villa where the Champagne flowed freely For a nightcap, the Davos crowd traditionally retires to the Tonic Bar at Hotel Europe, sipping cocktails while the forum fixture Barry Colson leads the crowd in Billy Joel singalongs. ” At last year’s Davos, the elites were certain the people of the world would never vote for things like Brexit or Trump or the Italian referendum. In other words, all was well. “Last year, the consensus here was that Trump had no chance of being elected. His victory, less than half a year after Britain voted to leave the European Union, was a slap at the principles that elites in Davos have long held dear, from globalization and free trade to multilateralism,” Barkin wrote in Reuters. This year, though, it’s a much gloomier affair in Davos. These world elites have found out, thanks to voters worldwide, they’re no longer the center of the universe. Financial elites are losing control on the world markets while political elites are losing control of international governments and cultural elites are seeing their star power fade. “Trump is the poster child for a new strain of populism that is spreading across the developed world and threatening the   liberal democratic order,” Barkin adds. “With elections looming in the Netherlands, France, Germany, and possibly Italy, this year, the nervousness among Davos attendees is palpable. ” And now, the gloomy affair in the Swiss Alps is getting even more depressing. According to Bloomberg’s Matthew Campbell and Simon Kennedy, those at Davos are even beginning to wonder if they’re “part of the problem. ” “Did the global elite’s devotion to borderless capitalism sow the seeds of a populist backlash?” reads the subhead of a recent Bloomberg piece from Campbell and Kennedy. The piece quotes Harvard professor and former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Kenneth Rogoff as admitting that Davos is never correct. “A joke I’ve told 1, 000 people in the months since leaving Davos is that the conventional wisdom of Davos is always wrong,” Rogoff said. “No matter how improbable, the event most likely to happen is the opposite of whatever the Davos consensus is. ” The elites at Davos are worried as the working class folks worldwide have stormed their castles and disrupted their lovely lives, the Bloomberg writers say, and they don’t find it very funny. “The repeated failure of business and political elites to predict what’s coming —  last year, that included the U. K.’s vote to leave the European Union —  doesn’t strike those returning this month to the Swiss Alps as very funny,” Campbell and Kennedy wrote. “After a year in which political upsets roiled financial markets and killed off the careers of     politicians, the concern for delegates attending this year’s meeting isn’t that their forecasts are often wrong, but that their worldview is. ” Populists shouldn’t take this as proof the war is over: The globalists will always try to fight back. There’s even rumblings that Party of Davos regular former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a disgraced   leader who lost his own primary election back in 2014 to now Rep. Dave Brat ( ) may try for a political comeback down the road. But if past is prologue, it’s unlikely these world elites will regain power and authority over the people who took their power away in the first place.": "27535",
    "On January 1, the Seattle City Council’s tax on guns and ammunition takes effect, thereby raising the prices on guns and ammunition for   citizens throughout the city. [Sponsored by City Council President Tim Burgess, the tax places another $25 on the price of a gun and “2 or 5 cents [on every] round of ammunition,” depending on the type of ammunition purchased.  According to The Seattle Times, the NRA filed a lawsuit in August to block the implementation of the tax, but King County Superior Court Judge Palmer Robinson “dismissed” the suit. The NRA cited the fact that Washington state has a preemption statute, which “forbids municipalities from passing regulations that impact ‘registration, licensing, possession, purchase, sale, acquisition, transfer, discharge, and transportation   …     or any other element’ of firearm ownership or commerce. ” But Judge Robinson viewed the tax as something other than regulatory in nature, and thereby upheld Seattle’s right to tax firearms and ammunition. Robinson opined that the tax on guns and ammunition is covered by “the City’s constitutional and legislative authority to impose taxes, which is separate from its regulatory authority under its police power,” and is therefore not hindered by the state preemption statute. The NRA disagreed and promised to appeal the decision. Until then,   residents of Seattle will pay more for every gun and bullet they buy for   within city limits. Breitbart News previously reported that Chicago enacted this same tax in 2013. Homicides rose in 2014, and they rose even higher in 2015. In fact, numbers from the Chicago Tribune indicated that by November 23, Chicago homicides for 2015 had already exceeded homicides for all of 2014. Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.

    "WASHINGTON (AFP)  —   A coalition air strike accidentally killed 18 members of a     alliance fighting the Islamic State group near a key town in northern Syria, the   coalition said Thursday. [Tuesday’s strike occurred south of Tabqa, a strategically important town on the Euphrates River next to a dam and military airport, and close to the IS stronghold of Raqa.  “The strike was requested by the partnered forces, who had identified the target location as an ISIS fighting position,” a coalition statement read. “The target location was actually a forward Syrian Democratic Forces fighting position. ” SDF troops backed by coalition air power and other military assistance have been fighting for control of Tabqa since last month. The town is considered an important waypoint ahead of the main offensive for Raqa, the IS group’s last bastion in Syria. In its own statement, the SDF described the incident as a “painful accident” resulting from a “mistake. ” “The accident caused a number of deaths and injuries. The general command of the Syrian Democratic Forces is coordinating with international coalition forces to investigate the incident and uncover the reasons and conditions that led to this accident. ” The coalition offered its “deepest condolences” to the members of the SDF and their families. “The coalition is in close contact with our SDF partners who have expressed a strong desire to remain focused on the fight against ISIS despite this tragic incident,” the coalition statement said. Officials were assessing the cause and would “implement appropriate safeguards to prevent similar incidents in the future,” the statement added. The SDF is a local   force that the   coalition is supporting with arms, air strikes, training and advice as they fight IS.": "28006",
    "The era of big cable sports is over. [It ended on Wednesday, April 25, 2017, when ESPN began laying off 100 writers and   radio and television talent.  The era began after 2011, ESPN’s high water mark, with the network viewed in over 100 million households. Then, resulting from a combination of   and wanton leftist propaganda disguised as sports coverage, the cable dinosaur saw its once flourishing empire reduced to a relative fiefdom. ESPN lost over twelve million subscribers since 2012, and according to some reports, 10, 000 subscribers a day. The subscriber losses led to layoffs in 2013, and again in 2015. For much of America, and certainly most on the right, the message of ESPN’s historic setback seems clear: stop bringing leftist activism into our sports escapism. Cease using sports as a Trojan horse to masquerade a social justice agenda, and maybe people will want to watch your network. But, what lesson did ESPN take from their setback? For the purposes of this discussion, it’s more important to take a look at who ESPN didn’t layoff, as opposed to who they did. According to the sports media site Awful Announcing, which kept a tracker of the ESPN layoffs throughout Wednesday, of the 60   talent and writers who publicly acknowledged being laid off before midnight central time on Wednesday, none of them, not a single one, were among the usual suspects when it comes to purveying leftist activism at ESPN. Tony Kornheiser, who once likened Tea Party Republicans to ISIS remains at ESPN. So does his     partner Michael Wilbon. Bomani Jones, who once appeared on Mike  Mike in a “Caucasians” tee shirt remains at ESPN as does Kevin Blackistone, who once ripped Michael Jordan for donating one million dollars to the police. Granted, only 60 of the reported 100 have been laid off, and some of the more liberal personalities at ESPN could very well find themselves without a job on Thursday. However, as of the time of this writing, one thing is clear: If America’s   and ratings killing of ESPN was an attempt to send the message that we wanted less politics in their sports coverage, that message fell on deaf ears. Not that anyone should shed a tear about what happened on Wednesday. ESPN losing influence and power is a great thing. Anytime the people who gave Caitlyn Jenner the Arthur Ashe Courage Award lose the ability to influence young minds, that’s a win for America. However, the fact that ESPN laid off none of their worst political offenders, clearly shows that the leftists are still very much in control in Bristol, and if that didn’t change after losing twelve million subscribers, it won’t change anytime soon. Why does that matter? ESPN may have laid off nearly half their total talent on Wednesday, but they didn’t hang the “going out of business” sign on the door either. The era of big, cable sports died Wednesday, but the era of big liberal sports will go on. ESPN is currently investing massively in their digital properties, sensing that digital and online offerings will become the wave of the future as more and more people move away from cable and traditional television. But, if the same people who turned the ESPYs into an   Amendment infomercial are still calling the shots, then ESPN’s future digital properties will represent just as big a threat to our culture as they did when they appeared on Channel 206 of your DirecTV package. In fact, if anything, ESPN will likely become more political in the future, especially after their social justice agenda was so roundly rejected by so many. Sports fans who want to watch games and debate free of political persuasion won a battle yesterday. But, the war will go on. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn": "28748",
    "Robert Costa writes in the Washington Post that the “first   target” of the populist and nationalist movement that propelled GOP nominee Donald Trump’s campaign will likely be the Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. [From the Washington Post:  The first   target for the grievance movement is likely to be House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) who has drawn Trump’s wrath for not supporting him more fully. Trump’s backers, both inside the House Republican caucus and out, are already talking about a takedown. Fox News host and Trump ally Sean Hannity said in an interview after the debate that Ryan was a “saboteur” and “needed to be called out and replaced. ” Hannity said he would actively urge   conservatives to launch bids against Ryan.   …     “The revolt that has been going on in the Republican Party, that brought Trump to where he is, is not going away. If anything, it’s going to intensify,” said Patrick J. Caddell, a veteran Democratic strategist who advises Breitbart, the   website, on polling. “Republicans are living in a dream world if they think their voters are going to stop fighting the political class,” Caddell said. “What has happened will metamorphosize. The American people will not go gently into the good night of obscurity. ” At the fore of this conglomeration is Stephen K. Bannon, the former head of Breitbart who has become Trump’s most influential confidant. Bannon encouraged the candidate’s claims of voter fraud and references to a deeply corrupt global conspiracy of international banks and   politicians.   …     “What the media misses is the amount of anger that’s out there. Trump didn’t create that,” Bannon told CNN late Tuesday in a rare interview. Read the rest here.": "36570",
    "With the debacle of health care reform in the rearview window, conservatives in Congress and the White House are turning their sights on President Barack Obama’s financial regulations. All indications are that the GOP is more unified in how they want to go about “repealing and replacing” these regulations  —   most of which were passed as part of the   Act in 2010.    For the past six years, these reforms have provided key protections to consumers and stability to the banking system by protecting consumers. They’ve made banks more resilient and created stability in the capital markets.  Expect Republicans, as in the case of the health care bill, to attack the regulations by way of the budget: specifically, through the “budget reconciliation” process that eliminates the threat of a Democratic filibuster. Contrary to many headlines, the executive orders President Donald Trump has released so far related to banking regulations do little more than call for reviews. Reviews are the sort of thing a   administration would normally have quietly done during the transition. True, Trump can do damage to financial reform when he appoints regulators hostile to enforcing the law. But undoing the regulations won’t be as simple as flipping a switch, or swapping out one set of political appointees for another. There would have been no point in passing something like   if a Republican president could overturn it by fiat.    It is unlikely, also, that Congress will overturn   with a big bill. The Senate is the crucial threshold, and the legislation Republicans have floated is so aggressive it’s unlikely it can get 60 votes. The CHOICE Act that has been proposed by Republicans in the House would repeal or dismantle virtually every part of   from the Volcker Rule (which prevents commercial banks from making certain kinds of speculative trades) to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to the ability to prevent a collapsing financial firm from bringing down the broader economy.     But the CHOICE Act goes still further, splitting the Federal Reserve in half and preventing it from coordinating financial regulations and monetary policy, something that will make bubbles more likely  —   and more dangerous to the economy. It would reduce the deference given to regulatory agencies, making regulations harder to pass, and harder to interpret. Republicans did not seek any Democrat input on the bill, and as such it’s unlikely to gain the support it needs to overcome a filibuster. Bloomberg’s Matt Levine called the bill “a kitchen sink of grievances. ” Yet there’s a way around the filibuster  —   one that will be familiar to those who have closely followed the health care debate. For years, conservatives in Congress have been eyeing the pieces of   that can be repealed through budget reconciliation, a process that only requires a simple majority vote in the Senate (if the changes follow a complicated set of rules related to spending). This poses the biggest danger to financial reform in the next year.    Where financial regulations are concerned, Republicans’ top targets may surprise you. Many knowledgeable observers, such as Ben Bernanke, point to the ability of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to take over and   a financial firm on the eve of collapse  —   an ability created by    —   as a signal achievement of financial reform. Such powers would have prevented Lehman Brothers from going into bankruptcy in an uncontrolled manner, as it did in 2008, and would have thereby taken significant stress off the financial system. Yet these powers are in the crosshairs.  Many also argue that the risks of lending and borrowing among investment banks in the capital markets  —     “shadow banking”  —   carry the potential to produce panics, runs, and other crises. Regulators have made progress in limiting such risks. Yet Republicans want to bring this kind of oversight to a halt.  Republicans love to hate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau The biggest target of all, however, is likely to be the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was created to ensure that consumers have a dedicated financial regulator on their side. In its short life, the CFPB has been a remarkable success. It was essential in extracting a $100 million settlement from Wells Fargo for creating fake accounts for its customers that they did not want, then charging them fees for those accounts. It has provided billions of dollars in relief through legal actions against companies that used deceptive practices to sell financial products.     Perhaps most importantly, the bureau has brought transparency and accountability to previously opaque markets like consumer credit reporting, making clear just how much putting that new computer on your credit card will cost you in the long run. It has clarified for consumers the fine print aggressively wielded by nonbank debt collectors, mortgage and student debt servicers, and   colleges. These are markets where consumers are often not in a position to rectify injustices themselves. Conservatives have argued, however, that the CFPB is unaccountable and     —   that it lacks any of the administrative checks that accompany other regulatory agencies. Rep. Jeb Hensarling ( ) chair of the House Financial Services Committee, has called it the “most powerful and least accountable” agency in American history. That’s the same exact wording used by Mitt Romney while running for President in in 2012. But this supposed unaccountability is a canard. The CFPB is structured exactly like the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) another banking regulator  —   one that the CFPB is designed to complement and counterbalance. Like the Comptroller of the Currency, the CFPB has a single director, a dedicated funding stream, and a clear mission.  The similarity between the two regulatory agencies is no accident. (Indeed, the Senate Report on the   Act says the CFPB’s policies and “provisions are modeled on similar statutes governing the Office of the Comptroller. ”) In the   to the financial crisis, the OCC and other federal regulators put bank profitability over safeguards for consumers. The CFPB wields a similar level of powers but has a mandate to fight for consumers. It was unclear whether President Trump would fire CFPB Director Richard Cordray upon taking office. The legal case to do so was nonexistent, though many prominent Republicans encouraged him to. For now, Cordray has his job, which is set to naturally end in July of 2018, though the CFPB is still a target. We can expect Republicans to use reconciliation to dramatically reduce the budget, and by extension the effectiveness, of the CFPB. A move to keep “shadow banking” in the shadows The next target for Republicans will be the mechanism we have for dealing with risks posed by the overall financial sector. One of the lessons of the financial crisis is that it’s possible for the risks associated with traditional banking  —   panics, bank runs, and cascading failures of institutions  —   to be present in activities and institutions that aren’t traditional banks.     In the aftermath of Lehman Brothers’ collapse, investors in money market mutual funds, for instance, began rapidly pulling their funds. Soon, money market funds with no known Lehman exposure were having panics; in one week, investors in such funds withdrew $349 billion. This was the beginning of an It’s a Wonderful Life style banking run, but one that was in the capital markets of Wall Street instead of your neighborhood bank. Rapid deregulation had led to a situation in which large commercial banks like Citigroup had investment banking subsidiaries within them that were poorly regulated relative to traditional banking.   has fought for a consistent and clear regulatory regime for this type of credit creation. Republicans, however, don’t share this goal: The American Enterprise Institute recently ran a headline flatly stating “Shadow banks are not a source of systemic risk. ” Republicans plan on instituting    regulation reflecting that assumption.  The way Republicans plan on achieving this dubious goal is by reducing the funding for the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) a council of regulators whose job is to monitor the financial system, while also slashing the budget of the newly created Office for Financial Research (OFR). The Financial Stability Oversight Council requires financial firms that pose an unusually high risk of collapse, panic, and uncertainty to the economy to follow tougher regulations  —   including straightforward regulations followed by regular commercial banks. Republicans will also weaken the FSOC by appointing people to the council who share the ideology that there are no special risks in this sector. This upcoming attack is unfortunate because, as Amias Gerety, former Treasury assistant secretary for Financial Institutions under President Obama, describes in a recent paper, there’s been significant progress in reducing systemic banking risks. Bets that were hidden off the balance sheet of major financial firms have been put back on the books, making them clearer to investors and forcing banks to fund themselves with enough capital to handle the attendant risks.  New capital requirements require firms to have enough liquid funds to survive a crisis and make required payments to other firms. The riskier money market funds have been reorganized so they now have a value that fluctuates, which reduces the incentives for investors to be the first out the door like they did after Lehman failed. (Before, investors tended to bolt when money market funds “broke the buck”  —   when the share of a fund purchased per dollar dipped below $1. The new system makes it clearer that such funds, which tend to have low risk and low returns, aren’t guarantees.) However, by going after the funding of the regulators designed to handle future risks in capital markets, progress could be stopped dead.    Some institutions are indeed “too big to fail. ” But that doesn’t fit GOP ideology. Republicans will also try to use budget reconciliation to kill the funding and emergency powers given to the FDIC to deal with a failing financial institution, should the Lehman Brothers scenario recur. One reason is that many influential Republicans think, once again, that there’s simply no systemic problem that needs fixing. When Financial Services Committee Chair Jeb Hensarling introduced his CHOICE Act to roll back   he answered a question about the “too big to fail” issue by saying that letting big banks fail, as the government did in the case of Lehman, posed no problems: “Although it was painful, and somewhat chaotic, in many respects, those in the bankruptcy arena would tell you, the Lehman bankruptcy, to some extent, worked as it should have worked. ” But there are good reasons why we shouldn’t simply let financial institutions like Lehman Brothers go bankrupt, especially during a crisis. Bankruptcy is slow while a financial crisis is quick. Bankruptcy isn’t designed to stop financial runs or keep operations running, and it is certainly not designed to quickly coordinate across the vast complexity of financial firms that exist in dozens of countries.  Access to a secure line of funding is necessary to keep crucial banking functions running  —   and that can be difficult to secure during a bankruptcy, especially if the financial markets are chaotic. A random bankruptcy judge won’t have any experience with the financial firm in advance. What’s more, both the bankruptcy judge and Congress will face huge political pressure to resort to bailouts to prevent a crisis. To handle this,   provides the FDIC with a special power to take over and gradually shutter financial firms in case of emergencies.  It’s called Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) which oversees what Barney Frank calls “death panels for banks. ” Such liquidations are designed to function in some ways like bankruptcies, but they’re executed by regulators, who will have great familiarity with the industry and the firm. They can be done on the eve of a failure, which prevents managers from gambling to try to fix themselves  —   creating new problems that put the financial system at risk.  The FDIC can adjudicate claims quickly under this receivership, including putting a hold on derivatives and other complicated financial instruments. It can create a bridge company that allows for the transfer important entities to a new company. By targeting the parent company of a financial firm’s structure and forcing it to prepare for failure in advance, it can handle international scale and complex scope of financial institutions in a way bankruptcy cannot.     The liquidation authority has a dedicated funding stream that allows the FDIC to borrow against the failing firm’s assets in a time of crisis. Though taxpayer money is always recovered first by statute, the CBO scored this power as having a budgetary cost. This score is controversial because CBO assumed money would be lent within the   period but not recovered until afterward. Thus, under the complex reconciliation rules, Republicans can change and perhaps remove this power.   can be weakened through neglect, and the regulators President Trump puts into place are certainly likely to try that strategy. But the main danger is funding. Paul Ryan’s goal in the next two years is to recreate the federal government using a narrow majority and Senate budget rules to dodge the filibuster. This approach is dangerous when it comes to financial reform, because instead of creating a system that works for the overall economy, the proposals may well amount to a    of whatever fits this procedural trick.  Rapid change is the strength of this approach, but it would be rapid change in a direction that hurts consumers  —   and it makes a repeat of the 2007 to 2008 financial meltdown more likely.

    "In the days after the election of Donald Trump,    Ursula Garza began to think about planning her funeral. Garza, who lives in San Antonio, Texas, is an   diabetic. For years, she’d gone without health insurance, forced to beg for insulin  —   which could cost her as much as $600  —   from friends who worked in doctors’ offices and and from donation centers, picking up supplies vial by vial. Last April, she’d finally gotten coverage under the Affordable Care Act  —   a literal lifesaver, she said, that allowed her to get an insulin pump. But the effect of years without insurance had taken its toll: she lives with chronic pain, nerve damage, and vision problems. Like millions of Americans, Garza is now contemplating the possibility that she could lose her health insurance if Donald Trump follows through on his campaign promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act. If Obamacare goes, Garza, a single mother to an    daughter, doesn’t know how she would survive. “It’s very scary to me  —   the thought of him taking it away is just a nightmare,” she said. “There’s only so much a body can handle. If I find myself uninsured again, I don’t know what will happen. It sounds morbid, but I’ve been looking at funeral plans. ” The question of what   Trump will do with the Affordable Care Act is, like much of his presidential policy, up in the air. It has left many preparing for the worst: transgender people who say they are rushing to stock up on hormones or schedule reassignment surgeries, women who say they plan to get implanted birth control devices for fear the costs of monthly pills will become unaffordable again. “We have no idea yet” what will happen to the 20 million people who are currently insured on the exchanges, said Gary Claxton, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health care nonprofit. Under a Trump presidency, “whatever comes next will be pretty different, and how you get there has the potential for disruption. ” Late last week, after spending months on the campaign trail promising to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, he signaled that he was open to keeping some key parts of the law, like a ban on denying coverage because of   conditions. But despite some support on both sides of the aisle, retaining coverage for those with   conditions is far from simple, Claxton said. “In the ACA, all policies are available to anyone who wants them” regardless of   conditions, he said. “But that’s dependent on a lot of other things that allow it to work, like the individual requirement to have insurance and subsidies to bring healthy people into the market. Those things aren’t particularly popular. ” If the individual mandate is repealed, experts say, there will not be enough healthy people paying into the system  —   or paying penalties for lack of insurance  —   to cover the steep costs of insuring people who are already sick. Insurers would have to deny those sick people coverage, or, at the very least, force them into costlier insurance plans or those that don’t pay for conditions they already had. That deep uncertainty has weighed heavily on the minds of people like Garza, who have only recently adjusted to life with health insurance. “Right now I just don’t know,” Garza said. “Will there really be insurers that will offer plans for people like me, with   conditions, that I can afford?” Joel Walker, 30, of Dayton, Ohio, began to fix his rotting teeth after he got health care coverage for the first time in ten years under a Medicaid expansion. He’s waiting now to be fitted for dentures. “It should be the first time in  —   wow  —   a decade that I’ll be able to smile with a mouthful of teeth,” Walker said. Walker, who is also taking medication for a heart condition, said he has felt as though he was “inside a steel cage of depression” since the election, worrying what will happen if he loses access to his dentist, cardiologist, or the medicine he’s dependent on if the ACA is repealed. He voted for Hillary Clinton, but for the first time in 28 years, his county, Montgomery, flipped Republican. “To put it bluntly, I felt a little betrayed,” Walker said. For some, however, the looming end of the Affordable Care Act offers a shred of hope. Laura Mansour, a retired nurse in Bradford, Pennsylvania, got insurance through a state exchange but found she could no longer cope with the price of her insurance, which had a $638 monthly premium, a $7, 000 deductible and   that had climbed to almost $100 for a doctor’s visit. With no choice, she said, Mansour dropped her insurance this year, planning to go uninsured until her Medicare coverage kicks in. Mansour, like “everyone” in the   town where she lives, supported Donald Trump, partly out of a hope that he will bring jobs back to coal country and partly, she said, because she is counting on him to lower health insurance costs. “They need a whole new revamp,” Mansour said. “Everybody should be able to get health care, but I don’t think you should be penalized for not having it. ” In Belleville, Illinois, Rebecca Gabriel says her entire family has been touched by the Affordable Care Act. It’s allowed her to insure herself and her two children for just $35 a month, covering the costs of a monthly medication that has “changed” her son’s life. Without insurance, they would pay $236 for the medication alone. In the next town over, Gabriel’s niece, who has severe brain damage from a car accident, is reliant on ACA coverage. “That’s what we’re really freaking out about,” Gabriel said. “Because of Obamacare, they can’t put a lifetime cap on her insurance, they can’t boot her off because of a   condition. She was in a coma for more than a month  —   her hospital bills were well over $1 million. Obamacare has been a lifesaver for us. ”": "112722",
    "In “My President Was Black,” The Atlantic’s   Coates examined Barack Obama’s tenure in office, and his legacy. The story was built, in part, around a series of conversations he had with the president. This is a transcript of the first of those three encounters, which took place on September 27, 2016. Valerie Jarrett, the senior adviser to the president, was also present. You can find responses to the story, and to these conversations, here. Barack Obama: All right, where do you want to start.   Coates: You know, I was thinking about something today that I heard, and I wanted to see if you could confirm it, and if you could, whether you could talk about it. I was told that the night of the inauguration it was a huge, huge party here. Is that correct? Obama: [Chuckles] That would be correct. Valerie Jarrett: The second inauguration   …     Obama: You’re talking about the second inauguration? Coates: Was it the second? Celebrities, maybe Stevie Wonder and Usher? Obama: First inauguration we had —  you know, this is a good example of when you first arrive, you don’t know what you’re supposed to do. So there are all these state balls that take place, and we sort of assumed —  we were told —  well, you should go to all the balls. So   …     Coates: Did you try that? Did you try to go to all of them? Obama: We went to all of them. And you do a dance at each one. Coates: Fifty? Obama: No, no, not every state has one, but we went to 10 or 12. And by the time we were done, it was like 1 o’clock, so we had Wynton Marsalis here playing, and people had been hanging out, but by the time we got back Michelle’s feet were all hurting and swollen up, and I was exhausted, and we hung out here probably for half an hour, and went to bed. Now, the second inauguration, we had it a little more figured out. So we did, like, three balls and then got back here and had a DJ and, yeah, Usher and Stevie. Coates: How late did you go? Obama:  ? Four o’clock? Coates: Was the second one more joyous for you —   Obama: Yes. Coates: It’s one thing you’re the first black president, but it’s like “Wow, this really —  ” Obama: Yeah. I think the way to think about it is the first inauguration is like your wedding in the sense that it is a joyous moment and occasion, but you’re so busy and kind of stressed making sure that Aunt    and Uncle    and cousins are getting tickets that it ends up going by without you even really knowing what’s happening. The second one you could savor. But partly, as you indicated, for political reasons as well. Because we had gone through four of the toughest years this country has gone through since the ’30s. And to be able to win a majority of the vote the second time indicated that we had worked with a broad cross section of the country and they trusted what we were trying to do. And it wasn’t just a singular   moment it was an affirmation that people thought we had done a good job. Coates: I think for those of us —  and I certainly threw myself in this camp —  I was telling Valerie the other day, the idea of a black president was a joke, in every black   comic routine everywhere —   Obama: Right. A friend of mine gave me Head of State —  remember [Chris Rock] and Bernie Mac? —  when we were still running. Said, “Man, you got to see Head of State. ” [Laughter] Coates: Yeah, this was like a  . But I think one of the things that did distinguish you was the ability to see it and to have the vision that, yes, this could happen, and then to have it again. I’m speaking specifically in terms of race   …     There were those of us who said, “It’s no way. ” And to see it the first and second time must have really reaffirmed a lot of what you thought. Obama: As I said, the second time, people had seen me work. They had seen me have victories, they had seen me have defeats, they had seen me make mistakes, they had seen me at some high moments but also some low moments. So they knew me, at that point, in the round. I wasn’t just a projection of whatever they hoped for. You know, we always cautioned each other, in the ’08 race, that people were projecting so much onto my campaign —  you know, that this would solve every racial problem, or that this indicated that we were beyond race, or that we were going to magically usher in a new era of progressive politics, and that we had vanquished all the   politics of the past. And for us to then be able to grind it out, to figure out how do we get out of this Great Recession, and what’s the process where we can finally get health care done even if it’s not pretty, and how do we deal with winding down two wars, and how do we clean up after an administration to reinvigorate things like the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department. People had seen all that, and then had to make a judgment: Do we want to continue on this course, and do we continue to have faith in this person? And so it is true that, for me at least, in some ways the first race was lightning in a bottle. I saw it, I envisioned the possibility of it, but everything converged in a way that you couldn’t duplicate. The second race as a consequence felt more solid, because it was harder. And you know we didn’t have tailwinds, we had a lot more headwinds. Coates: Yeah, I have my own theories about this, and I wonder what yours are. Why were you able to see it? Obama: The first time? Coates: Yeah. You said you were able to envision the possibility. Why? I mean, when you think about yourself —  because obviously, as you know, a lot of African Americans could not —  what’s the difference? Obama: Yeah. I’d say a couple things. The first was that I had been elected as the senator of Illinois, and Illinois is the most demographically representative state in the country. If you took all the percentages of black, white, Latino, rural, urban, agricultural, manufacturing —  [if] you took that cross section across the country, and you shrank it, it would be Illinois. So when I ran for the Senate I had to go into southern Illinois, downstate Illinois, farming communities —  some with very tough racial histories, some areas where there just were no African Americans of any number, and I had seen my ability to connect with those communities and those people against some pretty formidable opponents. When I ran for the Senate, I was one of seven candidates. One of them, Dan Hynes, was already the state comptroller, was the son of the former Senate president and chair of the Democratic Party, a   Irish family in the state, who got the endorsement, I think, of 100 out of 103 county chairs as well as the   endorsement. And you had a multimillionaire   manager who was spending huge amounts of money. And when we won that race, not just an African American from Chicago, but an African American with an exotic history and a name Barack Hussein Obama, could connect with and appeal to a much broader audience. And then, keep in mind, that the response of the 2004 convention speech was admittedly over the top, and so I had for two years seen the response I would get when we traveled all around the country. I had campaigned on behalf of other Democrats. Ben Nelson, one of the most conservative Democrats in the Senate, from Nebraska, would only bring in one national Democrat to campaign for him, because typically he tried to distance himself from Democrats —  and it was me. And so part of the reason I was willing to run and saw the possibility was that I had had two years in which we were generating enormous crowds all across the country —  and the majority of those crowds were not African American and they were in pretty remote places, or unlikely places. They weren’t just big cities or they weren’t just liberal enclaves. So what that told me was, it was possible. Coates: Did you have doubts? Obama: Yes. Coates: You did have doubts? Obama: Look, I think Valerie remembers us sitting around our kitchen table —  a group of friends of mine, some political advisers, Michelle —  and I think our basic assessment was maybe we had a 20, 25 percent chance of winning. Coates: The presidency? Obama: The presidency, yeah. Because I did think given the problems President Bush had had, that whoever won the Democratic nomination would win the presidency. And so the issue really was, could I get the nomination, particularly with a formidable candidate like Hillary Clinton already preparing to run? And my view was not that this was a sure thing, but what I never doubted was my ability to get white support. Coates: You never doubted that? Obama: No. And I think that in addition to the proof of my Senate race, if you want to go a little deeper, there is no doubt that as a mixed child, as the child of an African and a white woman, who was very close to white grandparents who came from Kansas, that I think the working assumption of discrimination, the working assumption that white people would not treat me right or give me an opportunity, or judge me on the basis of merit —  that kind of working assumption is less embedded in my psyche than it is, say, with Michelle. There is a little bit of a biographical element to this. I had as a child seen at least a small cross section of white people, but the people who were closest to me loved me more than anything. And so even as an adult, even by the time I’m 40, 45, 50, that set of memories meant that if I walked into a room and it’s a bunch of white farmers, trade unionists, middle age —  I’m not walking in thinking, Man, I’ve got to show them that I’m normal. I walk in there, I think, with a set of assumptions: like, these people look just like my grandparents. And I see the same the same   mold that my grandmother served, and they’ve got the same, you know, little stuff on their mantelpieces. And so I am maybe disarming them by just assuming that we’re okay. And if anything, my concern had more to do with I’m really young. I mean, when I look back at the pictures of me running in ’08, I look like a kid. And so my insecurities going into the race had more to do with the fact I had only been in the Senate two years. Three, four years earlier I had been a state legislator, and I was now running for the highest office in the land. Coates: I want to stay with this for a second. You know, to prepare for this piece I’ve been going back and reading some of your writings. And one of the things I noticed going through Dreams From My Father, which I read a long time ago —  it’s very different reading it. Obama: The second time? Coates: Yeah, and then after eight years. Yeah, and then —   Obama: After seeing how things played out. Coates: Right. And one of the things I saw in there: Your grandfather has this black dude come over who’s interested in his daughter, and he’s accepting. Obama: Yeah, listen, I’m always kind of surprised by that. Like I said, it wasn’t Harry Belafonte. This was like an African African. And he was like a   brother. Nilotic. [Laughter] And so, yeah, I will always give my grandparents credit for that. I’m not saying they were happy about it. I’m not saying that they were not, after the guy leaves, looking at each other like, ‘What the heck?’ But whatever misgivings they had, they never expressed to me, never spilled over into how they interacted with me. Now, part of it, as I say in my book, was we were in this unique environment in Hawaii where I think it was much easier. I don’t know if it would have been as easy for them if they were living in Chicago at the time, because the lines just weren’t as sharply drawn in Hawaii as they were on the mainland. But I do think that at the end of the day, some of my confidence that people are people and that the very specific historical experience and sociological reality of racism in this country has made for significant differences between black and white populations, but that people’s basic human impulses are the same. I mean, that just grows out of who I am. It’s a biological necessity for me to believe that, right? And so my politics ultimately would reflect that. There’s one last point about this, though, that then bears on my presidency that I think I should point out in terms of both my confidence that I could win in ’08 but also the fact that I was lucky and maybe a little bit naive: In 2008 I was never subjected to the kind of concentrated vilification of Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, the whole   ecosystem, and so as a consequence, even for my first two years as a senator I was polling at 70 percent. And it was because people basically saw me unfiltered. I was at a   meeting, or I was talking to people directly, or they had met me, or I would speak at a university or go to a VFW hall. But they weren’t seeing some image of me as trying to take away their stuff and give it to black people, and coddle criminals, and all the stereotypes of not just African American politicians but liberal politicians. You started to see that kind of prism being established towards the end of the 2008 race, particularly once Sarah Palin was the nominee. And obviously almost immediately after I was elected, it was deployed in full force. And it had an impact in terms of how a large portion of white voters would see me. And what that speaks to —  and this is something I still strongly believe —  is that the suspicion between races, the way it can manifest itself in politics, in part comes out of people’s daily interactions and the fact that we’re segregated by communities, and by schools, and our churches, and people’s memories passed down through generations. But some of it is constructed on a constant basis it’s being created all the time. And I think what I did not fully appreciate when I first came into this office was the degree to which that reality would be the only thing that a large chunk of the electorate, particularly the white electorate, would see. You know, Bill Clinton told me an interesting story. He went back to Arkansas with a former aide of his when he was governor and when he was running, who ended up running for Congress and was about to retire from Congress. This was one of the last blue dogs. And as they were traveling aroundthis former member of Congress said to Bill, “You know, I don’t think you could win Arkansas today. ” And he said, “Well, why not?” He says, “You know, when we used to run, you and I would drive around to these small towns and communities out there, and you’d meet with the publisher and editor of the little   paper, and you’d have a conversation with them. And they were fairly knowledgeable about some of the issues, and they had their quirks and blind spots, but basically you as a Democrat could talk about civil rights and the need to invest in communities and they understood that. Except now those papers are all gone and if you go into any bar, you go into any barbershop, the only thing that’s on is Fox News. ” And it has shaped an entire generation of voters and tapped into their deepest anxieties   …     Coates: Just as a counterpoint to that, I wonder about another argument one might make —  that you were more likable to these folks before you had power. In other words, once you literally became a black president, that was a real thing. And that activated their fears —   Obama: Yeah, yeah. Look, I think that the —   [long pause] Coates: Like, that they needed Fox News. Obama: Yeah, but what I would argue would be that the folks for whom that is true —  they hadn’t voted for me in the first place. I mean, what I’m arguing is not that the concerns or suspicions or fears around changing demographics and increased diversity aren’t right there on the surface for a lot of voters. They are. But what I’m saying is that they are shaped and influenced depending on what they see day to day. And they are more malleable, and they can go in a better direction or a worse direction. And if what they are seeing and what they are taking as truth is that this black president is trying to hurt you or take something from you and looking out for “his own,” then they will respond differently than if they hear that this president is trying to help you. But it’s hard. And here are the issues involved and here are the choices that he’s having to make. There’s no better example of that than the whole debate around Obamacare, where the whole way in which it got framed as ‘He’s trying to take something from you to give free stuff’ —  in this case free health care but it could also be free phones, or free cheese, or whatever —  ended up dominating the debate even in those communities that stood to benefit most from this program. But part of that was the story, the narrative that they were receiving. And people don’t have the ability to   and, you know, sort through what’s true and what’s not, especially on a complicated social program like this. Coates: Do you think that holds true even in an era right now when we have so much access to information? Obama: Yeah. You know, in some ways the access to all this information has made it easier to set up narratives that are entirely separate from fact. I mean witness the current election and what Trump is doing. There is no grounding in fact. But because, with all the proliferation of websites, and blogs, and digital content, you can just create your own hermetically sealed world where people are never going outside of their existing assumptions, I think it’s a bigger problem, not a worse problem. I guess the point being that: Was there always a certain quotient of people who, even if it was hard for them to admit, would not vote for me because I was African American? Absolutely. That was true when I was running for the U. S. Senate and that would be true if I was trying to catch a cab. Do I believe that’s the majority of white Americans? Absolutely not. And I think my elections proved that. Do I think that good people who are not instinctively afraid or concerned about an African American in authority can be made afraid, and suspicious, and fearful, because of what they are seeing, hearing, and reading if it’s not attached to the facts, and evidence, and reality? I think that can have a big impact. Coates: One of the things that I think also is here is not just your ability to envision the presidency, just the optimism for the country you have in general. I think, at this kind of young age you really saw —  if I may say so —  the best of white America in a very sort of direct way —   Obama: Right. Coates: Which I think is very different than most African Americans. I didn’t really grow up around white people, but even the abstract construction was as a malignant force in my life, which I had to make my way out of much, much later in life, in my 20s, when I had intimate contact. And I wonder how much of that general optimism you think emanates from your biography. The exposure too, the cosmopolitan nature of all you’ve seen. Obama: Yeah. I mean, look, I think all of the above. I think I was deeply loved by my mom and my grandparents. I felt that, and I carried that with me. I spent time outside of the United States, which gives you a perspective on how people of all kinds of different races, and ethnicities, and religions, and backgrounds can figure out ways to divide themselves and try to be superior to others. So that I ended up looking at race in America as one example of a broader human problem, rather than something that was unique and I was trapped in. Right? But I also, I think, benefited from the very particular era that I was growing up in, because in some ways, the last 55 years —  the years I’ve been on this Earth —  have a very particular trajectory of progress that is incomplete, is partial, that   African Americans enjoy in ways that really impoverished African Americans do not yet feel. But that trend would feed my optimism as well. Now, you know, what’s interesting is the work that I did as an organizer in Chicago would help to temper that optimism and ground it so that it wasn’t just a bunch of happy talk. And it’s one of the reasons why, for the generation just ahead of me, I would learn of the anger, frustration, bitterness of my elders and respect it and understand it even if I ultimately did not agree with it. Coates: Did you right off the bat, when you first encountered it? Obama: Yeah. And part of it was just because, you know, I had sort of steeped myself in it, although as still an intellectual exercise. I remember reading The Autobiography of Malcolm X, and I remember reading it, even as a young person, and saying to myself, Now, if this had happened to me, I’d have a very different attitude. Right? And that’s part of what I tried to explain in my race speech in Philadelphia when the Reverend Wright controversies came out. He’s of a different generation. He had different experiences. And that sense of being trapped and caged and witnessing brilliant people broken by an unjust system —  family members beaten or jailed, or just harassed, or unable to realize their potential —  could drive you crazy. And so I think I not only was mindful enough of it by the time I had moved to Chicago, but even in my relatively sheltered and unique circumstances, I had the experiences that every African American has. Which is somebody in front of a restaurant will hand you the keys, thinking you’re there to park their car. Or —  I write about this in Dreams From My Father —  being in a tennis tournament and the tennis coach, who is supposed to look out for all the kids, telling me, ‘Don’t put your finger on the draw that’s been posted about who’s playing who, because you might make it dirty.’ And when you’re 12 years old and look up at some guy, you think: What? Or walking into an elevator and having some woman who you know lives on your floor or above you walk out of the elevator because she’s worried about riding with you even though you’re a kid. So, you know, you have enough there to have a sense of how anger could pool and well up and, in some cases, consume you. But I also, I think, by that point would have benefited from enough circumstances in which assuming the best in people had paid off —  where there had been a teacher who had really been helpful and looked out for me even when I didn’t completely deserve it. Or, you know, just witnessing the example of a Dr. King, or an Arthur Ashe. And so I’m coming of age at a time where you’ve got the strength and defiance of a Malcolm or an Ali, and you’ve also got the soulfulness and the moral strength of a King. And those things are speaking to each other. They’re in a conversation. And you’re saying to yourself, I can draw from both of those traditions. And there may be times where it is right to be angry and defiant. And there may be times where you’ve got to give the country and white people the benefit of the doubt. And if you’re so eager to give them the benefit of the doubt that they slap you down and you don’t know it, that’s a problem. But if you’re so invested in the anger that you don’t seen when somebody is putting out their hand in a sincere gesture of friendship, then you’ve now become your own jailer. It’s not just someone else jailing you. Coates: Right. It occurs to me, obviously, to have our first black president a product of the times, a product of certain things going around, a product in some part of the administration before —  but have you ever thought you needed to be a certain person who had not had this sort of trauma at a young age? Who was capable of giving that sort of optimism —  that it couldn’t just be, okay now the country’s ready, Joe Blow Black Dude steps up, and wins, with political gifts, obviously —  but I think that optimism sticks out. Obama: Yeah. Look, I have no doubt that the first African American president had to be somebody who could speak the way I did in the 2004 convention speech about the ideal of what America is. As opposed to —   Coates: What it isn’t. What it hadn’t done. Obama: Right. But that’s true of just running for president generally. Very rarely has somebody won the presidency based on a dark, grim vision of what America is. Coates: Well, we’re getting close. Obama: Right. Well, we’ll see my proposition tested in this election cycle. Maybe the closest is Nixon, who employed the southern strategy and surfed the backlash coming out of both the antiwar movement and the   movement. But as a general proposition, it’s hard to run for president by telling people how terrible things are. Because at some level what the people want to feel is that the person leading them sees the best in them. And so, did the innate optimism that I carried with me both because of my upbringing and maybe just temperament help? Absolutely. But I’m not sure it had to be me. I’ve said before that Deval Patrick could have been the person who broke that particular barrier back in 2008. And it so happened that he had just run for governor and felt committed to finishing up his term. But he has the gifts and I think the persona that would have appealed at that time to the American public. And there are probably some other figures as well who might have pulled it off. Coates: How did you feel when that optimism was directly challenged? I was telling Valerie this the other day: We’re at home watching the State of the Union and some guy stands up and yells, “You lie. ” Obama: [Laughing] Yeah, that was something. Coates: And this is a guy from South Carolina —  we know about South Carolina, he’s confirming everything we feel —   Obama: Yeah, that was something. I still remember looking at him like, Really? what are you doing? Sit down. Coates: Were you angry? Obama: You know, I’ve got to say, I wasn’t angry so much as I was just stunned. It was just so unexpected and raw that I didn’t —  and to me just kind of ridiculous —  that I couldn’t really generate anger. Coates: And you didn’t feel insulted or   …     ? Obama: Well   …     look. There is no doubt that there have been occasions during my presidency when I’ve said, ‘Y’all just would not do this with anybody else.’ Now, obviously the whole   thing is the most salient example. I mean, there’ve been 43 other presidents. I don’t remember the issue of where somebody was born ever coming up before. And so there have been other instances like that. There was one time where I was making a statement out here. And in the middle of my statement, somebody just started yelling. It was a reporter —   Coates: It was a reporter from The Daily Caller. I remember this. Obama: From The Daily Caller. And I was probably more mad on that one. Because —  whereas Joe Wilson, you got a sense of just this weird impulsive action on his part —  this felt orchestrated and showed a lack of respect for the office that I think was unprecedented in a Rose Garden statement. Part of what’s been difficult, though, during my presidency, is untangling the degree to which some of these issues are because of race and some of these issues being reflective of just a coarsening of the political culture and a sharpening of the political divides. Because I do remember watching Bill Clinton get impeached and Hillary Clinton being accused of killing Vince Foster. And if you ask them, I’m sure they would say, ‘No, actually, what you’re experiencing is not because you’re black, it’s because you’re a Democrat.’ And right around the beginning of Bill Clinton’s presidency and what corresponds with the rise of   media, a lot of the old boundaries and rules of civility just broke down. Now, one way to think about this is that issues of race and issues of political philosophy have always been entangled, and it’s hard to draw them out. Right? So when I think about the Tea Party or conservatives who’ve opposed my agenda, I have no doubt that there are those who oppose my agenda because they have a coherent and sincere view about the role of the federal government relative to the state governments they believe that an overreaching federal power that is taxing, regulating, redistributing is contrary to the vision of freedom that the Founders intended —  and they can believe those things independent of race. Having said that, a rudimentary knowledge of American history tells you that the relationship between the federal government and the states was very much mixed up with attitudes towards slavery, attitudes towards Jim Crow, attitudes towards antipoverty programs and who benefited and who didn’t. And so I’m careful not to attribute any particular resistance or slight or opposition to race. But what I do believe is that if somebody didn’t have a problem with their daddy being employed by the federal government, and didn’t have a problem with the Tennessee Valley Authority electrifying certain communities, and didn’t have a problem with the interstate highway system being built, and didn’t have a problem with the GI Bill, and didn’t have a problem with the [Federal Housing Administration] subsidizing the suburbanization of America, and that all helped you build wealth and create a middle class —  and then suddenly as soon as African Americans or Latinos are interested in availing themselves of those same mechanisms as ladders into the middle class, you now have a violent opposition to them, then I think you at least have to ask yourself the question of how consistent you are and what’s different, what’s changed. You know, I always talk about when I was doing   law and people would talk about the dearth of African Americans in police departments and fire departments around the country. And they would say, ‘Well, this should be a meritocracy, and everybody needs to take a test, and that’s objective, and anything else is affirmative action and unfair.’ And I’m thinking, Well, when Officer O’Malley or Officer Krupke was walking the beat, nobody said it was a meritocracy then. What happened? We’re suddenly now of the notion that somebody who’s a police officer or firefighter having some affinity and familiarity with the community they are serving is completely out of bounds. What changed? So I think that one of the things I’m always trying to do is to just promote a consistent philosophy and ethic about how government can help everybody and try to show that what worked for the majority community in previous generations would be likely to work now, too. And the burden is on those who oppose investments in these things to explain what’s changed. Coates: I was caught because you said that you were the only person that Ben Nelson brought in to campaign for him. And maybe my memory is wrong, but I believe he was one of the harder folks to negotiate with in terms of getting the [Affordable Care Act] passed. You can correct me if I’m wrong, but as I recall, I heard in 2008 from your campaign that there was room to work across party lines, there was room for people who disagree to come together. If we just put forth intelligent proposals, folks would be able to come together. When did you realize it wasn’t quite going to go that way? Obama: In the first two weeks. Mitch McConnell’s statement about how our No. 1 goal was to make sure Obama was a   president. That hadn’t surfaced publicly yet, but —   Coates: Did that surprise you when that got to you? Obama: No, because by that time we had seen the behavior. But, and I’ve told this story before, the economy was in a free fall. And the one thing I anticipated was that we could get some bipartisan cooperation early on, at least to stop the bleeding, before normal politics kicked in. I mean, we were losing hundreds of thousands of jobs, folks were losing their homes everywhere, the financial system was locked up, the auto industry was melting down. And the risks of us going into 15 percent unemployment and a real catastrophic situation were reasonably high. And so speed was of the essence. And we put together this package, called the Recovery Act, which was basically a big stimulus package, and we designed it in such a way that we thought it would have some appeal to Republicans. Because we had infrastructure spending, and we had spending going directly to states to make sure they weren’t laying off teachers and police and firefighters, and we had a big tax cut for ordinary families, as well as spending for clean energy and education and a whole host of other things. And I still remember the day that I’m scheduled to meet with the House Republican caucus, and I get into the car and we’re driving up, and I forget who it was, but one of my staff tells me that John Boehner has just announced that they are opposed to the Recovery Act. Before they had even seen it, before I had made a presentation, before I had had a conversation with them. This was going to be sort of the opening round of negotiations where I’m explaining to them the dire situation and asking for a bipartisan effort to help the American people. And they had shut it down. And that, I think, gave me an inkling of a different political environment than the one that we had seen in the past. Now, again, I think it’s really important to understand that had there been a white president —  had Hillary Clinton been president, or Joe Biden been president —  it is entirely possible that they would have pursued the same strategy. Because the way politics had been structured at that point, where there was so much political gerrymandering, and the media has increasingly become so balkanized, there was an understandable political incentive for them not to cooperate. You know, the genius of Mitch McConnell —  and to some degree John Boehner —  was a recognition that if we were about to go into a bad recession and the president had come in on this wave of good feeling, Democrats control the House, they control the Senate —  if he’s completely successful in yanking us out of this and cleaning up a mess a Republican president had left behind, that we might lock in Democratic majorities for a very long time. But on the other hand, if Republicans didn’t cooperate, and there was not a portrait of bipartisan cooperation and a functional federal government, then the party in power would pay the price and that they could win back the Senate   the House. That wasn’t an inaccurate political calculation. And they executed well, and we got clobbered in 2010. So the lesson I drew there was a political lesson. It was not a racial lesson. Coates: I just want to push this a little bit more. What about the idea that it’s not so much you as a black man as president, but the fact that we’re at a point in history where the Democratic Party, especially locally —  the states —  has become very racialized? Obama: Well, I think what is true is that when the southern Democrats all flipped, and over the course of successive elections, dating back to ’68, you have a process whereby 90 percent African Americans are voting in the Democratic Party, and southern and many rural and western whites are increasingly voting Republican, and cultural issues become more prominent, that it helped to accelerate what has been called this great sorting. And when you combine that with political gerrymandering, when you combine that with the impact of the media, it makes it easier for Republicans not to cooperate, because there’s nobody in their districts that will punish them for not cooperating with a Democratic president. There is no doubt that that’s true. Now, I leave it at this, and maybe we can pick it up in our next conversation: I think what was more of an early lesson around race was the Skip Gates incident. And the reason that was interesting to me was because I didn’t think it was that big of a deal, and I didn’t think my statement was particularly controversial. I don’t know if you know Skip, but Skip is a little guy who uses a cane and has a limp and is late 60s. And if he’s on his porch and he ends up being handcuffed, then my working assumption was, everybody would kind of think that was kind of an overreaction. Now, Skip can be, you know, salty, so I have no doubt that —  I wasn’t there, but I would not be surprised if Skip used some inappropriate language with the officer when the officer came up to question him. And, you know, this wasn’t some great   injustice. But it was interesting to see how what I thought was sort of an offhanded and fairly innocuous statement, which was, look, you know, this probably wasn’t —  I think I said this: The Cambridge police probably handled this a little stupidly. And the fact of the matter is that part of the reason this becomes news is because there’s this underlying feeling on the part of a lot of African Americans that interaction with police is not always evenhanded. To see the cultural reaction, and in retrospect to see how my poll numbers with white voters dropped really significantly off this one tempest in a teapot, that was instructive. Now, there are some who say that’s when Obama started trimming his sails on racial issues. That’s not accurate. That’s not accurate. The truth is that I wanted to make sure that we did not have a bunch of distractions at a time where I’m just putting out fires everywhere. I mean, I’ve got two wars, I’ve got an economic crisis of a proportion we haven’t seen since the Great Depression, and that was not the time, from my perspective, to just open up a big floodgate of conversation around race, which I did not think was going to be productive. What I did learn from that, though, were two things. One was —  that was one lesson among many, in those first six months —  about the magnification of my words. So if I look at the statement that I made at the time that I thought was pretty innocuous, using the word stupid would be a word I’d never use now, just because I’m president and everything gets magnified. So I could have made the same point in a way that would not have, I think, felt as visceral. Coates: You think you could have got that across about it? Obama: I think I could have got it across better. So that’s point No. 1. Point No. 2, though, is: What it also showed me was the degree to which the filter that I discussed earlier can completely shape a narrative in a way that will just run until you get some sort of circuit breaker going. And part of what I had to start teaching my staff was: not to overreact to that. Because what is absolutely true is that, you know, my press office freaked out around that in a way that I was not that freaked out about. There was a part of me that was like, ‘Okay, so the Cambridge police isn’t happy with me, but this really isn’t a big deal, we’ve got other stuff we’ve got to worry about.’ They were channeling what they were seeing coming at them suddenly in the press room and through news reports. And what that meant then was that, on issues of race, certainly on issues of race as it relates to law enforcement, what I wanted to make sure of is that when we said something that was precise, that we were choosing those moments where we had the best chance of driving home the point and extracting real progress. And that we needed to think about how the narrative would be shaped in a way that was constructive rather than us just being on the defense all the time. You know, so it’s interesting for me to think about that moment and then all the subsequent issues that have come up. Coates: Yeah, it got a lot worse than that, than being arrested on your porch. Obama: Well, exactly. Right. But the dynamic around which everybody went to their respective corners on what was such a small incident, it foreshadowed the response that I would get later. And to this day, it does not matter how many times I will say, “You know what? Our police have a tough job and 99 percent of them are doing a great job,” etc. and I will get letters afterwards: “Why are you always throwing cops under the bus? Why do you hate police?” [Laughing] And I literally made my press office sort of put together a packet of something like 30 statements that I’ve made, highlighted in yellow, that I will send to constituents —  because oftentimes, you know, these are the wives of police officers who are scared for their husbands, and I don’t want to ignore them. But it tells me what they’re seeing. It tells me what they’re hearing. The filter through which they are receiving information is powerful. And that was an early lesson about how powerful that filter was.": "82403",

    "Material from Edward Snowden’s files that has heretofore been withheld from the public reportedly includes news that the NSA listens to   mobile calls placed “above 10, 000 feet. ”[According to TechCrunch, a new report from Le Monde and The Intercept touch on this previously unreported information to show that “NSA and its British counterpart GCHQ have an entire program dedicated to tracking targets in the skies. ”  The report explains that the surveillance measures are being used as airlines expand allowable usage of cell phones during flight. The only thing required to eavesdrop is that the plane reach an altitude above 10, 000 feet. The report explained GCHQ’s process: To spy on a telephone, all that was required was that the aircraft be cruising at an altitude above 10, 000 feet. Secret aerial stations on the ground could intercept the signal as it transited through a satellite. The simple fact that the telephone was switched on was enough to give away its position the interception could then be   with the list of known passengers on the flight, the flight number, and the airline code to determine the name of the smartphone user. TechCrunch explains that “Air France appears to be the favorite surveillance target for this particular flavor of spying, but as of 2012, British Airways, Lufthansa, Emirates and more than 20 other commercial airlines were of interest due to easing restrictions around   GSM phone use. ” An NSA document that The Intercept obtained shows “entire flights by carriers Air France and Air Mexico have been designated ‘possible terrorist targets’ for more than a decade. ” Slides that illustrate the steps of such surveillance also explain how targeted suspects are apprehended. One slide explains, “We can confirm that targets selectors are on board specific flights in near real time, enabling surveillance or arrest teams to be put in place in advance. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of “Bullets with AWR Hawkins,” a Breitbart News podcast.

    "For Daniel Patrick Moynihan, it was the racism charges that broke the camel’s back. His famous 1965 report on the pathologies of black culture landed him in a hornet’s nest. “I was not a bigot,” he wrote later, “but the good guys were calling me a racist, while here was this fellow Buckley saying these thoughtful things. Glazer and I began to notice that we were getting treated in National Review with a much higher level of intellectual honesty. ” Moynihan was just one of many   who was startled to find a rare bastion of sanity in National Review. That trickle of refugees from liberalism would prove critical to getting William Buckley’s fledgling conservative movement off the ground. Having once regarded themselves as liberals, many neoconservatives had managed to attain influential mainstream positions that traditionalists of Russell Kirk’s persuasion would likely have found difficult. They were invaluable for raising the movement’s profile. At the same time, their experience and background made them savvy to policy. They would lay the groundwork for conservative policy developments over the next several decades. The time is ripe for recruiting a new crop of  . Who’s ready to get mugged by reality? As liberalism declines, conservatives need to make sure that our doors are open to refugees from the other team. It might also be helpful to extend a few feelers to people who show some sympathy to conservative ideas. Where   ideology is the only game in town, one or two persuasive arguments might sometimes be enough to instill deep doubts. The Left may be especially vulnerable to this kind of offensive precisely because they are so dominant in the academy, the mainstream media, and many of the professions. First and foremost, our nation is drowning in debt even as our entitlement and pension commitments are becoming dramatically more onerous. The 2016 election has driven this issue out of sight and mind, as both major candidates lure voters with promises of still more goodies. Regrettably, fiscal problems on this scale never consent to stay in hiding for very long. Owing to irresponsible and dishonest promises made by mostly retired politicians, many aging Americans have dramatically   for their retirement years. They’re betting that taxpayers will somehow find a way to bail them out. This will be possible only up to a point. What we’re facing, over the medium term, is a significant   of the social contract. As longtime advocates of localism and fiscal discipline, conservatives are in a much better position to generate helpful insights and reasonable compromises. Those could serve as recruiting calls for liberals who are broadly sympathetic to the stated aims of union negotiations and Great Society reforms but who ultimately are honest enough to acknowledge the mess that those initiatives have created. As in Moynihan’s time, race is becoming a defining cultural fault line, and once again, the Left has committed itself to unstable movements with questionable agendas. Black Lives Matter has at least some sympathetic concerns, and many conservatives are already at work on them, looking for ways to improve police transparency and prudently reduce our reliance on incarceration. Those goals are not advanced when protesters seize on any excuse to start torching police cars and smashing shop windows. Given that violent uprisings like the one in Charlotte almost certainly help Donald Trump more than they do Hillary Clinton, it seems clear that the Left, in whose   it would be to control the activities of Black Lives Matter, is unable to do so. Just as Moynihan was repelled by the Left’s obtuseness in denying glaring pathologies in black culture, so today’s progressives may eventually be attracted to a political movement that offers more than racial pieties. What we offer must be more than just a redux of the    narrative. In the 1970s, conservatives could plausibly argue that laxness in the justice system was facilitating cultural collapse. That’s a much harder sell today, and it’s certainly not a promising starting point for recruiting disaffected liberals. The good news is that we can offer compelling solutions to crime and racial tensions we do not have to resurrect anachronistic memes. We should point out repeatedly that crime and social collapse are especially egregious in longtime Democratic strongholds such as Chicago. Blue states including California have reformed their penal codes in haphazard ways that precipitated crime spikes. Meanwhile, red states including Texas and Georgia have had much greater success on the reform front, launching new initiatives that address   without sacrificing public safety. In short, conservatives are well equipped to reform our justice system reasonably, to everyone’s benefit. The Left is not, because Democrats are hopelessly beholden to surging social movements and hysterical interest groups. This argument might prove compelling for many disaffected liberals as they arrive at the (classically neoconservative) conclusion that reality is more complicated than they once believed. This leads us to a further consideration, which might prove compelling particularly for younger progressives who have been inundated with leftist memes from childhood onwards. For many Millennials, conservatism is like a foreign language. They lack even the foundational concepts that would enable them to grapple with the arguments. What is “free trade”? Are there really people who still believe that men and women are fundamentally different? What do we mean by “limited government”? As young liberals sour on what is to them the old world of the political and cultural Left, conservative ideas might have a real allure. For younger generations, tradition often has the benefit of feeling simultaneously   and novel. We might generate considerable momentum by daring young radicals to embrace conservatism, a truly countercultural move that promises to drive their teachers (and parents?) crazy. This list of suggestions is by no means exhaustive. The past eight years have treated us to a veritable parade of   failures. Barack Obama’s   foreign policy has left us with a host of burgeoning geopolitical threats. The president’s signature policy initiative is rapidly failing. Corruption and graft have increased, and civil liberties are eroding, even as two Caesari candidates vie for the Oval Office. If we’re looking for arguments to prove that the Left has failed America, we are truly spoiled for choice. No argument, of course, will convince everyone. That’s not necessary. An infusion of   could make the difference between a fading political movement and one that blossoms into new life. Let’s open some recruiting posts.,": "121080",
    "Thursday night’s   from which the barbaric Assad regime’s   attack against its own people was launched was both   and modest. It was modest because it was focused, targeted and limited. Its specific purpose was to degrade the regime’s ability to work its evil again. In his brief statement, President Trump did not make broad claims or suggest further action was in the offing. He expressed appropriate outrage at the murder of children with gruesome banned weapons, but based his action in   terms  —   as punishment for Bashir   violating the terms of the Chemical Weapons Convention of which Syria is a signatory. The use of sarin, he said, is a threat to the “US and its allies. ” The president is right. Chemical weapons need not, after all, be delivered by plane. They can be carried by individuals and released in confined spaces like the Toyko subway system, where a 1995 sarin attack by terrorists resulted in death and horrible injury to dozens and incidental injuries to more than 5, 000 people. Over the past four years, Assad has been making commonplace what was once all but unthinkable  —   the deployment of a weapon of mass destruction against a civilian population. And he has been able to make it commonplace because the United States under Barack Obama repeatedly refused to respond to these acts of savage barbarity. And this is why I say the military strike was   as well as modest. In the first major test of Trump’s mettle as president, he has just put the world on notice: He is charting his own course in response to   events. This response seems to contradict many things he has said over the past four years about what the United States should do in Syria, and to overrun the words his own secretary of state spoke about Syria last week. That makes this militarily modest action even more geopolitically meaningful. Trump is signaling that his   tweets and his campaign’s naked appeals to isolationism may now be past their   date. Indeed, he sounded less like a cynical realist than a  —   dare I say it?  —   neoconservative. The rhetoric of his brief statement was striking for its moralism: “We ask for God’s wisdom as we face the challenge of our very troubled world,” he said. “We hope that as long as America stands for justice, then peace and harmony will in the end prevail. ” Contrast this with two months ago, when he responded to Bill O’Reilly asking him about Vladimir Putin’s record of killing people with shocking insouciance: “What,” Trump said, “do you think our country’s so innocent?” What a difference a sarin gas attack makes. And North Korean missile tests. Trump approved the strike with the prime minister of China in his company. Xi Jinping and Trump are meeting this weekend with the key subject now being the increasingly belligerent and provocative regime in North Korea. For more than a decade, we have been looking to China to act to end the nuclear ambitions of North Korea by threatening to cut off that regime’s economic lifeline. China has basically refused to act. Trump’s action last night sends a message to Xi and to the rest of the world: Take me seriously.": "128720",
    "Jane Mayer of The New Yorker has a new book out: “Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right. ” It’s mostly about those old devils the Koch brothers. Charles and David Koch are billionaires. They own a very big company. They also are very prominent philanthropists, giving hundreds of millions to cancer research, concert halls and other worthy causes. But what makes them hated and feared by progressives such as Mayer is their political work. They help fund some organizations and foundations, some purely educational, some partisan. To listen to the left, they are the closest thing we have to   James Bond villains. So what is their agenda? Is it to retreat to their orbiting harems, populated with fertile females, as they wipe out humanity below so that they can return to repopulate the planet? Or is to dupe the Russians and Americans into a nuclear squabble so that the Kochs can rule the ashes? Well, here’s Mayer’s explanation of their dark and sinister ambitions: “What people need to understand is the Kochs have been playing a very long game,” she told NPR’s Steve Inskeep. “And it’s not just about elections. It started four decades ago with a plan to change how America thinks and votes. So while some elections they win and some elections they lose, what they’re aiming at is changing the conversation in the country. ” Dear God, it’s worse than I thought! They want to change the conversation! They want to persuade Americans to vote differently! The horror, the horror. You might be forgiven for thinking that this is pretty much exactly what democracy is about. But no. For you see, only Hollywood, college professors and administrators, the ACLU, People for the American Way, the Human Rights Campaign, NARAL, Black Lives Matter, Occupy Wall Street, MoveOn. org, the NAACP, the Union of Concerned Scientists, Greenpeace, Tom Steyer, Michael Bloomberg, George Soros, Steven Spielberg and, of course, publications such as The New York Times, The New Republic, The Nation and Mayer’s own New Yorker are allowed to try to change conversations and argue for people to vote differently. Ah, but those voices are open and honest  —   and progressive!  —   about it, while the Kochs are secretive, sinister denizens of the stygian underworld of “dark money” and the “radical right. ” Except for the fact that the Kochs have been out in the open for nearly a  . David Koch ran for vice president on the Libertarian ticket in 1980, which you might argue is a brilliant way to hide in plain sight, given how little attention the Libertarian Party gets. Which brings me to that term “the radical right. ” When racist idiots do idiotically racist things, we’re told that’s the radical right in action. When Christian conservatives say Christian things, we’re told that’s the radical right in action. When Donald Trump says he wants to ban Muslims from entering the country or build a giant wall, that earns him the   label. When Ted Cruz says he wants to   the Islamic State, he . . . well, you get the point. I have myriad problems with those usages of “radical right,” but let’s stipulate for the sake of argument this is the correct term in such circumstances. How, then, are the Kochs members of the radical right? They are   marriage. They favor liberal immigration policies. They are passionate   when it comes to foreign policy. They are against the drug war and are spending a bundle on dismantling   “mass incarceration” policies. They’ve never seized a national park at gunpoint. They are members of the radical right for the simple reason that they don’t like big government and spend money to make that case. Full disclosure: I’ve given paid speeches to some   groups, despite the fact that I have my disagreements with the Kochs. They haven’t changed my mind, and I haven’t changed theirs. But the conversation continues. And that’s their great sin. Liberals are constantly talking about how we need an “honest conversation” about race or guns or this or that. But what they invariably mean is, they want everyone who disagrees to shut up. The best working definition of “right wing” today has almost nothing to do with the ideological content of what   say or do. A   is someone who disagrees with the liberal narrative, has the temerity to say so and dares to actually try to change the conversation.": "140249",
    "WASHINGTON  —   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley Thursday said it was unsurprising that a gun lost by U. S. federal agents had wound up in the hands of Mexican drug lord El Chapo, and warned guns from the failed “Fast and Furious” program could be in circulation for another 100 years. “It doesn’t surprise me one bit. There were about 2, 000 guns that were under Fast and Furious, and we think that there’s only been 500 of them recovered. So these guns will be around for maybe a century killing people, you know?” Grassley told BuzzFeed News Wednesday afternoon. On Wednesday the AP reported that the Justice Department had confirmed that one of the rifles seized earlier this year at El Chapo’s hideout in Los Mochis, Mexico, was one of more than 1, 400 guns that agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms lost between 2009 and 2010. Fast and Furious was a program designed to identify and arrest illegal gun runners: federal agents allowed suspects to purchase the guns in the hopes of tracing them to buyers. Instead, an estimated 2, 000 guns went missing, and most  —   but not all  —   ended up in the hands of Mexican drug cartels. In 2010, Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was killed with a Fast and Furious gun. Grassley, who had not yet been briefed on the El Chapo case, couldn’t say whether he will open new hearings into the program. But he slammed the administration’s unwillingness to cooperate with congressional investigators, who have been looking into the program. “On hearings, you know what? They haven’t even cooperated with us on the investigations we’re doing, and we’d probably have answers to a lot of these questions that we’ve asked for,” Grassley said.": "106103",
    "(CNN) The use of a robot to kill the man who authorities say fatally shot five Dallas police officers has drawn attention in part because it’s the first time police have used robots in such a manner. Below is a series of questions that I have been asked frequently and preliminary answers. The facts remain incomplete, so these are preliminary thoughts.  What happened? In the wake of the shooting of the Dallas police officers Thursday night during a peaceful protest, police cornered the shooter     Micah Xavier Johnson    in a parking garage. After an   standoff that included exchanges of gunfire, they used a robot to deliver an explosive that killed the gunman.    Why did they use it? ”We saw no other option but to use our bomb robot and place a device on its extension for it to detonate where the subject was,” Dallas Police Chief David Brown said at a news conference Friday morning. ”Other options would have exposed our officers to grave danger.” What robot was used? The system has been reported as a Northrop Grumman Remotec Andros, which is a   bomb disposal robot commonly used by police, military and other first responders around the world. It is wheeled, weighs around 220 kg (485 pounds) and mounts various sensors and a robotic arm with grippers.  Why is this being reported as a big deal? This is the first use of a robotic system by the police in a deliberately lethal manner.  Are there parallels or past precedents by the police? Robots are used all the time by police bomb squads forces around the world in bomb disposals. They are also frequently used in surveillance roles by SWAT teams and the like. They have been used in standoffs with armed gunmen in a variety of examples, from helping to figure out where the gunman is hiding to delivering pizza to the gunman and hostages during negotiations when a person wasn’t allowed in. But none of these involved delivering lethal force.  The closest parallel I am aware of was a case in 2011, when police in Tennessee strapped tear gas grenades to a robot that then accidentally started a fire in a mobile home. This doesn’t seem a great parallel, as it does not reflect a decision deliberately to use the robot to kill. Another parallel would be the 1985 standoff in Philadelphia between law enforcement and the MOVE group. Manned police helicopters dropped two small explosive devices on the roof to try to open a breach into the building below where the group was bunkered in. Instead, the building caught fire, killing 11 in the blaze, and burning down many neighboring buildings. Again here, the parallel isn’t a perfect one. While it did involve a bomb, there was no robot, nor was it a deliberate use in the way authorities used the robot in Dallas.  What about in war? The best parallel that I am aware of is a case that I wrote about in my 2009 book ”Wired for War.” A U. S. Army soldier discussed how his unit in Iraq in the mid 2000s was equipped with a surveillance robot known as a MARCBOT. This is a remotely operated surveillance robot, equipped with a mast holding a small camera, not the kind used in Dallas. It costs about $8, 000. Their unit used the robotic system for roles like checkpoint duty if there was a car that was suspected of being a car bomb, they would send the robot for a close look, rather than a risk one of their people.  When they faced off with an armed insurgent holed up in an alley, the soldier told of how they came up with an ad hoc answer. They   the robot with an explosive device (literally   a claymore mine on it) and drove it down the alley to kill the insurgent, rather than risking a soldier. Why would the police have a bomb with them? It has not been reported which type of explosive was used, but it is important to note that it was clearly not the common image of a ”bomb” like the type dropped by an  . Police SWAT teams have small explosive charges that they use for breaches (to blow open a locked door or a hole in the wall to get around a gunman behind a door) while bomb squads sometimes will place  small explosive charges beside a known or suspected bomb to detonate it in a safe manner.  Update: Dallas PD has confirmed that the explosive device on the robot was a   C4 plastic explosive plus ”Det” cord, fitting with the analysis above. How does this link to the ”killer robots” debate?  While there are links to the discussion on the future of killer robots, known as LAWS (lethal autonomous weapons systems) there are also three important differences to keep in mind. First, this was not an autonomous robot both the robot and the explosive were remotely operated. Second, this was not a designed weapons system. There are many ground robots under development that are armed with weapons like machine guns and missile launchers, from the prototypes of the US MAARS to the Chinese Sharp Claw. But this was the case of using an older robot designed for something else. And, third, the concerns driving the ”killer robots” debate center on whether we can prevent the unleashing of   robots on the battlefield, for which militaries around the world are beginning to establish plans and doctrines. The debate is driven by a concern that such a future might cause both greater civilian harm and a lack of accountability.  By contrast, this was an ad hoc use, just like the case in Iraq. There is no doctrine that planned this out, no training manuals that police were following, nor development programs for this use. It also doesn’t appear to have risked civilian harm or raised accountability concerns of the kind that motivate the killer robots debate. There are links to that debate but they are more about the many different directions robot use might go to next. But doesn’t it portend a future of lethal police robots? It is too early to draw that conclusion. An important first use of robots in a lethal way by police was established. But you can counter whether that important first will open the floodgates with two opposite points. First, police forces around the world are already equipped with this type of robotic system. So it can’t cause mass spread of the technology since that spread was already under way. And, second, important precedents of use aren’t always followed. They can either prove to be exceptional circumstances or the public   police decide against them in the aftermath. Take the case of the 1985 MOVE standoff police helicopters dropped bombs, but that didn’t become a common practice in the years since.  What we can confidently conclude is that we will see greater and greater use of robotics in all sorts of roles, whether it be by the military, law enforcement, or just the rest of us in civilian life. Indeed, some 80 plus countries already have robotics in their militaries, while companies that range from Google to Tesla to Uber to Ford are planning on a future of ”  cars.” In policing, the robotics trend has been moving towards greater use of drones in surveillance roles, from smaller ones that might be used by individual units to large ones that could monitor an entire neighborhood or city. The key here is to distinguish the decision of unmanning a system from arming it. Just as manned police planes or helicopters are not armed (police don’t fly Apache attack helicopters or  ) the trend towards their unmanning doesn’t somehow mean they have to be armed. So, too, manned police ground vehicles, whether they be patrol cars or even military surplus MRAPS don’t mount cannons or machine guns like their military equivalent neither do the unmanned versions have to be armed by definition.  Before this incident, when it came to arming robotic systems in a law enforcement role, most of the discussion has been of ones using ”less than lethal” weapons. At a number of trade shows, robotic systems have been displayed that mount tasers and tear gas to China’s controversial Anbot, which is a police bot designed to operate autonomously and equipped with an electroshock device similar to a cattle prod. These, of course, prompt great debate that brings together elements of the robotics argument with the question over whether ”less than lethal” weapons actually lead to abuse (think about the debate over Tasers  they arguably save lives, yet might be used more often). Did the Dallas Police do the right thing? I’m not going to second guess them. The information isn’t all in, emotions are high, and the best judges of that are going to be experts on SWAT team tactics and lawyers that specialize in police use of force issues. In no way, shape, or form is any of this a condemnation. Indeed, it is the opposite. My reaction is similar to the one I had to the case mentioned above in Iraq I wasn’t there, but can certainly understand and, even more, empathize with what the people on the scene decided to do. At the same time, my analytic side can recognize that this is a big issue that has provoked debate.  Is this another sign of the ”militarization” of police in the U. S.? I have a hard time making that connection now. The debate over the militarization of the police seems to turn on 1) the use of equipment designed for war, often provided in surplus from the U. S. military, and 2) in a manner that is intimidating or threatening to the public.  In this incident, the technology is not one that is only used in war and it was not used in a way that was targeting the broader public indeed it was the opposite. Remember, the police in Dallas who were shot and killed were there protecting peaceful protesters, not intimidating them. Images from the scene beforehand showed police and protesters smiling together. In turn, when violence struck, the police on the scene bravely moved protesters to safety, while the media reported that protesters helped police find the shooter. The police and protesters were in it together so we, in turn, should not let people try to exploit the tragedy as a means to divide.  What are the overall issues at hand? Obviously, this use of robotic technology in a lethal manner was a big first and one can imagine pathways that take you into those concerns. Yet, even though I am someone who has written widely on robotics, the events of this last week leave me more concerned over other trends. The issue of robotics may be new, but the ease of mass violence in our society, the worsening of   relations, and all the challenges of race in America are problems that were there well before the tragic events in Minnesota, Louisiana, and now Texas. These are what we must face, and, most importantly, face together.": "55884",
    "It takes a few episodes of Better Things, the new FX comedy about an actor raising her three daughters in LA, to realize that there aren’t really any men in the series. Something similar dawns on you watching Atlanta, another new FX comedy about two cousins trying to make it in the southern entertainment Mecca’s   scene  —   except instead of men being absent it is white characters. Once you notice that these mainstays of traditional TV sitcoms aren’t here  —   as extinct as the dodo or Ryan Lochte’s endorsement deals  —   you also realize that you don’t much miss them. There are some men in Better Things, of course, but they are relegated to the minor roles usually reserved for women in comedy’s boys’ club: romantic interests and   shopkeepers and other such functionaries. To make the contrast even starker, the main character, Sam (Pamela Adlon) and her three daughters, Max (Mikey Madison) Frankie (Hannah Alligood) and Duke (Olivia Edward) all have dudes’ names.  The white people in Atlanta  —   and there are even fewer of them than there are men in Better Things  —   serve the same purpose that black actors do on other comedies. That is, they serve to make a point about race in America, before disappearing. For instance, a white colleague is seen to use the   around the main character, Earnest (Donald Glover) but not around his much more physically imposing cousin Paper Boi (Brian Tyree Henry) or their gonzo friend Darius (Keith Stanfield). The lack of such characters allows these new, fresh voices to be heard  —   and in both shows, they’re vibrant and engrossing. Better Things is a product of the partnership between Adlon and Louis CK  —   Adlon served as both a writer and   on Louie for several seasons and as CK’s wife on the   HBO comedy Lucky Louie. They created this show together (both serve as either writer or director of many of the episodes) and it shares lots in its DNA with CK’s signature creation. Not only is Better Things about an entertainer trying to raise a group of daughters it’s also an occasionally meandering, philosophical series of vignettes. Adlon’s character, Sam, is much more sympathetic and    than the Pamela we met on Louie. Just as CK is famous for his riff about how his kids are assholes, Sam has the same sort of antagonistic relationship with her children, scoffing at her oldest daughter when she asks her to score pot but then stealing the condom she finds under her daughter’s nightstand for an assignation with a married man.  While there are some   moments of feminism, like Sam’s speech at a women and girls’ empowerment seminar at her daughter’s school, Better Things is searching for a deeper meaning in how to navigate the world as a woman at all stages of life, both the good and the bad. Imagine Inside Amy Schumer were it half as didactic and twice as melancholy. While it sometimes can veer into familiar territories of sitcom schmaltz, Better Things offers essential fresh takes on motherhood, Hollywood and the vagaries of teenage life. Atlanta is as concerned with race as Better Things is about gender. In the show’s second episode, when Earnest finds himself in jail (not to be confused with Ernest Goes to Jail) he sees an inmate who is clearly mentally ill. When the cops say the inmate is imprisoned every week, Earnest wonders why they keep locking him up instead of getting him help. The cops treat him gently until he drinks toilet water and spits it at them then they viciously beat him. It’s comical, harrowing, audacious and sobering all at the same time.  That is what makes Atlanta an even better show than Better Things  —   in fact, one of the best new shows on television in quite some time. Glover is the star and creator of what feels a little bit like a   Girls. Earnest is barely employed, broke, and “technically homeless” as he pursues his dreams of being a rap manager while trying to raise his daughter. Like Lena Dunham, Glover is obviously playing a much less successful and ambitious version of himself.  While Atlanta’s observations are as keen as those in Better Things, the show is much more consistent in its laughs and tone. Atlanta also tackles a variety of subjects almost effortlessly, whether it’s homophobia and transphobia, the cycle of poverty, or the fraught relationship between law enforcement and the black community. Just as in real life, these issues can creep up anywhere and at any time, and Atlanta always has smart things to say about them.  Everything about this program seems new and vital, stylishly shot in hues that make the projects of Atlanta look like they were washed over with honeycomb and steeped in sunlight. The same is true of Better Things. This is a great step for FX, whose recent comedy duds, such as Baskets and SexDrugsRockRoll, deliver the same angsty   schtick that is pervasive in the world of     comedy. Though these new shows share little more than a network, they are also united in their desire to lend a voice to stories that are often ignored or marginalized. They’re both so darn good, audiences might start demanding fewer white guys in just about everything.": "151879",
    "I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. If you read articles about how to help someone with depression, you encounter a few common themes. Don’t tell people to “snap out of it. ” Don’t say you know what they feel like. Don’t act as though they have a choice in the matter. Where Is the Heir to Rage Against the Machine? The view of depression as a clinical, chemical phenomenon —  an illness —  is, theoretically, commonly accepted. Still, many people with depression say that it’s often talked about in unhelpful ways. Music, perhaps, can help. Deep, enduring sadness has been a muse for rock artists for most of the genre’s lifespan, but this year has provided a fascinating crop of young talents finding fresh ways to make art about the topic. The most vibrant examples are Mitski, a      and Car Seat Headrest, a Seattle band. “Catharsis” doesn’t seem like the right word for what they’re doing they’re dissecting feelings, trying to convey how they work and what effect they have on a person’s life. The joy of the music is partly in recognition —  both of truth and of a sharp writer’s talents. Mitski’s Puberty 2 opens with a dull jackhammering pulse, maybe meant to represent a kind of looming dread. The song is called “Happy,” and she sings about the title emotion as a   stand who disappears from her apartment while she’s in the bathroom, leaving her to clean up candy wrappers and other detritus from his visit. Incongruously loud saxophones blare to horrifying effect, but Mitski’s chorus, like many on the album, is surprisingly  . It’s a very smart take on the idea of emotional absence, and in her press materials Mitski explained what exactly she’s going for: “Happiness is up, sadness is down, but one’s almost more destructive than the other. When you realize you can’t have one without the other, it’s possible to spend periods of happiness just waiting for that other wave. ” The theme holds across highlights like “Fireworks,” where an acoustic guitar briskly strums out a chord progression that creates a feeling of melting while Mitski calmly fantasizes sadness fossilizing into “a slight grey in my eye. ” For the   reverie of “Thursday Girl,” she sings, “I’m not happy or sad, just up or down and always bad,” and on the short closer “A Burning Hill,” she describes how lack of control can coexist with perfect  : “I am the fire and I am the forest   I am a witness watching it. ” To cope, she’ll do nothing dramatic, just wear a white   so that she can, at least, “be neat. ” If Puberty 2 masterfully demonstrates how a certain kind of melancholy feels, Teens of Denial, the recent album from Car Seat Headrest, is a powerful companion piece for talking about its causes —  or its lack thereof. While Mitski’s songs manage to gut the listener while remaining small and sculptural, frontman Will Toledo works in the style of anthemic but   rock reminiscent of Modest Mouse or the Get Up Kids. It is surging,   music, but its lyrical concerns are precise, introspective, and often   in criticizing how society treats the congenitally sad. The opener “Fill in the Blank” uses the conceit of its title to suggest the interchangeability of emotional drains, while the chorus is from the point of view of   critics: “You have no right to be depressed   you haven’t tried hard enough to like it. ” The trope of the gloriously tortured artist gets sneered at on the jittery “Vincent”: Vincent van Gogh, Toledo informs us, has his picture on the Wikipedia page about clinical depression. On another standout, “Drunk   Whales,” Toledo sings about feelings as topography, and the metaphor is mirrored in the music’s veering from valleys of strumming to distorted, noisy peaks. The song’s title refers to two very different feelings —  leaving a party, and watching the   documentary Blackfish —  that lead to the same feeling of malaise. It’s a great insight, the notion that a small trigger can upend someone’s entire state. When I saw Mitski perform Wednesday night in Boston, she issued a warning from the stage: “I was reading Hamlet right until I came up here, which was a bad idea. It’s made me very morose. ” The news came with a laugh and an acknowledgment that it sounded like a cliché. As the audience then sang back the words she’d recorded on her most recent three albums, it made those words seem all the more extraordinarily specific. That was especially the case for “Last Words of a Shooting Star,” on which she tells of how sudden airplane turbulence makes her imagine what people will think of her bedroom after she’s dead —  all of which, conceivably, could be another metaphor for sadness that comes and goes without warning. But after just 45 minutes of intense performance, with a number of great Puberty 2 songs yet unplayed, the lights went up and Mitski left the stage. “She didn’t want to be up there tonight,” someone near me said. That, of course, was pure presumption —  “You actually don’t know me,” Mitski had earlier told an overeager crowd member. You can understand, though, why her songs might make people feel otherwise.": "78639",

    "As Republicans eye a rapid repeal of the Affordable Care Act, insurers and the interest groups that represent them are begging Congress to take it slow and come up with a replacement. Sen. John McCain ( ) says he doesn’t care what insurers think at all.  ”Insurance companies are the people who signed up to Obamacare. They have no relevance to me. I don’t want to hear from ’em,” McCain told reporters. ”We’ll devise our own replacement. We don’t need the insurance companies to sign on or AMA.” McCain said if Congress passes a law, insurers ”have to obey it,” but ”they are not at the table in negotiating.” McCain said that because insurers supported ”what has been a miserable failure, I am not interested in hearing their recipes for fixing it.” In December, America’s Health Insurance Plans, the industry trade group, took an unusual step of releasing their needs for a health insurance overhaul. Among their stipulations: keep paying out subsidies for insurers to keep them in the marketplaces and create a long transition period before changes to Obamacare take effect. They also want any major changes to be made in the beginning of a year, not the middle, to avoid uncertainty in the marketplace. Then, in an open letter Tuesday, the American Medical Association released a letter warning Republicans not to repeal Obamacare until they had a clear replacement.  “Patients and other stakeholders should be able to clearly compare current policy to new proposals so they can make informed decisions about whether it represents a step forward in the ongoing process of health reform,” the letter said. Other health groups have also warned against repeal.": "87702",
    "Mets officials will take two aspirins and call on Matt Harvey for Friday. A day after the Mets   was scratched from his scheduled start and   after failing to show up at Citi Field on Saturday, manager Terry Collins provided an outline Monday for Harvey’s return to the team. Included is what Collins expects will be an apology to teammates upon his arrival Tuesday before getting the ball three days later in Milwaukee. According to club sources, Harvey claimed he was experiencing migraine headaches on Saturday after playing a round of golf and never showed up for the Mets’ game against the Marlins. After the Mets’   victory, team brass convened, and the following morning Harvey was informed by general manager Sandy Alderson he had been suspended without pay for three games, beginning Saturday. Harvey’s return to the active roster is slated for Tuesday, at which time he will meet with club officials and be asked to address his teammates. “One thing he has to do  —   and he’s done it in the past  —   he needs to address some guys,” Collins said. “He wants to do it in a group, which is the easiest, I always think. Or if he wants to do it individually, he can do that. I’m just going to leave it where he’s most comfortable because we’ve got to get this behind us, so however he wants to go about it to do that, I’ll sign on for that. ” A club source indicated the drama Saturday began during batting practice  —   shortly after 4:30 p. m.  —   when Harvey was noticed missing. Mets pitching coach Dan Warthen was twice dispatched to call Harvey and both times received no answer. But by the end of batting practice Warthen had received a text message from Harvey saying he had a migraine and wouldn’t be coming to the ballpark. Harvey was then instructed in a text message to report to the ballpark and receive treatment. Later, after team trainer Ray Ramirez was unsuccessful in reaching Harvey to check on his condition, the Mets dispatched two team security officials to the pitcher’s Greenwich Village apartment to ensure he didn’t need emergency medical assistance. A club source indicated Harvey answered the door and repeated that he had a migraine headache. According to a club source, Harvey had never previously skipped a game, but had been late arriving on a few occasions and fined $500 at least once. But Harvey missed a team workout  —      —   before the start of the NL Division Series in 2015 and later apologized to teammates. The source downplayed the idea Harvey’s suspension stemmed from a “compilation” of events, saying any player who skipped a game without being excused would have received the punishment.  Harvey was expected to file a grievance against the Mets, but as of Monday afternoon the team had received no indication such an action was imminent. Harvey has 45 days to file a grievance. But Mets officials are more concerned with getting Harvey on track than a possible legal battle. Harvey is   with a 5. 14 ERA this season in six starts since returning from July surgery for thoracic outlet syndrome. “He’s got to realize we’re here to help,” a team official said. “We’re not the enemy. ” Team brass had considered slotting in Harvey to start on Wednesday against the Giants, but decided waiting until Friday in Milwaukee would benefit the   on two counts: He would receive extra time to throw a side session and he would be shielded from the immediate wrath of the Citi Field fans. “I think we’ll get by, we’ll get through it,” Collins said. “He’s just a big guy, a big figure on our club. He’s a big figure in New York and that’s a big city to be a big figure in. All together with the help of his teammates and the help of his coaching staff we’ll move on and hopefully in two months we’re back to where we were with him pitching well. ”": "130654",
    "During China’s recent “Two sessions,” in which some 5, 000 governing elites gathered in Beijing to   the agenda of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Wang Hongguang, a retired Chinese general, publicly dared the United States to deploy a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system (THAAD) in Taiwan. He boasted that the deployment would provide the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) with an excuse to use force to “liberate” the island. Wang had earlier dared the U. S. to deploy Marines to guard the site of the American Institute in Taiwan, the de facto American embassy on the island. He has threatened to use harsh countermeasures to retaliate against the government of Tsai   even though she had nothing to do with the decision to deploy the Marines in Taipei. Trump’s   on the One China policy has caused unnecessary confusion in Asia. It has weakened the administration’s moral position and credibility and has arguably given Beijing the upper hand in the   relationship. In my view, the One China policy is a trap that has been plied by Beijing to legitimize and strengthen the CCP dictatorship, squeeze Taiwan’s international space, and force Taiwan to kneel at Beijing’s feet. President Trump should take a fresh look at the One China policy, and honor the “right” China. In the late 1960s and early ’70s, President Nixon was anxious to get out of Vietnam and counter the Soviets’ global expansion during the Cold War. Henry Kissinger persuaded Nixon to betray and abandon the ROC  —   America’s   ally in Asia  —   by recognizing the PRC government as the sole legitimate government of China. Thus America willingly accepted the One China policy. In 1979, the U. S. Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act to maintain unofficial relations with the ROC. Later, President Reagan gave the “Six Assurances” for the ROC’s security, all of which were designed to keep the   status quo. Most American experts on China argue that this policy has worked well because it has helped maintain the regional peace. But I believe that the One China policy is seriously flawed and should be reviewed and modified. This policy has helped Beijing fundamentally shift the power balance in its favor, resulting in the creation of an authoritarian behemoth that impinges on the right of the Taiwanese people to   and that poses a severe threat to both regional and global peace. Beijing has demanded the recognition of One China as a prerequisite for entering into diplomatic relations and joining international organizations, and it has successfully excluded Taiwan from the current international system. This is unfair to the people of Taiwan. The ROC has always been an outstanding member of the international community. It made enormous sacrifices during World War II and great contributions to the Asian economic  . Even in the wake of America’s abandonment of Taiwan and Beijing’s relentless pressure, the ROC has peacefully transformed itself into a democratic country and become a beacon of freedom in Asia. By contrast, since the Communist regime in Beijing first entered the international community under the One China policy, it has taken advantage of American markets, capital, and technology to rise to its position as an evil empire. Instead of respecting international law and order, as Kissinger assured us it would, Beijing has sought to reshape the international order in ways that ensure the PRC’s dominance. The CCP brutally cracks down on any dissent by its citizens and also undermines international peace and stability by bullying countries in the region, including Taiwan. Worse, the regime even boasts about its capability to nuke America. Standing up for democracy has long been a core element of American foreign policy, not only because the U. S. has a moral obligation to support democratic countries that share the same values but also because such support will make America and the world more secure. The One China policy forced on Washington by Beijing has not been adjusted to take into account the ROC’s democratic governance. At the same time, an underlying assumption of the policy, namely, political reform and peaceful transition, has not materialized. In short, the policy is out of date and not in the   best interest of the U. S. and it should be updated accordingly. America’s difficulty in refining the ambiguous One China policy has over time allowed Beijing to hijack and distort the term. For example, the U. S. only acknowledged Beijing’s One China position in the 1972 first joint communiqué of the PRC and the U. S. without expressly accepting it. But in the 1979 joint communiqué of the PRC and the U. S. the U. S. recognized Beijing as the sole legitimate government of China, and further, in these nations’ third joint communiqué, in 1982, the U. S. was pushed to admit that it had no intention of pursuing a policy of “two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan. ” President Clinton went to so far as to state that the U. S. would not support Taiwan’s independence. Presidents Bush and Obama also took a similar position. Today, the PRC and America have, in practice, recognized of the One China policy as legitimate. Step by step, Beijing has fully cast its One China spell on the U. S. The grave danger caused by the United States’ ambiguous, often   statements and practice regarding One China is that they fail to draw a red line to guarantee Taiwan’s security in a legally binding agreement this could offer an opportunity for Beijing to invade the island in the future. The U. S. did not secure Beijing’s commitment to abandon the use of force against Taiwan. In 2005, the Communist regime passed the     law, explicitly stipulating that it will use force against Taiwan’s “independence provocation. ” But that term’s meaning remains totally subject to the regime’s interpretation. Today, more than a thousand missiles are pointing at the island across the Taiwan Strait, but Beijing considers it a serious “provocation” if the ROC even mentions THAAD as a possible means of defending itself from a potential attack, Even if the One China policy was justified 40 years ago, the geopolitical conditions calling for it no longer exist: The Soviet Union collapsed long ago, and the new Moscow has formed a strategic alliance with Beijing Vietnam now sides with the U. S. in opposing China’s aggressive behavior in the South China Sea, and the PRC has become a formidable power challenging America’s global leadership. I believe the best way to break the One China spell is for the U. S. to refuse to accept Beijing’s sovereignty over Taiwan and to formally recognize the ROC as a legitimate government by signing an agreement with it. The agreement should incorporate the updated and expanded components in the Taiwan Relations Act and President Reagan’s “Six Assurances” to reflect Taiwan’s democracy and America’s commitment to its defense. Such strategic and moral clarity will deter Beijing’s aggression and achieve peace through strength in the region. To conclude, I want to quote a fellow citizen of China: “As a mainland shitzen (sh** + citizen) I do not give a sh** who is in power, but I am happy to see Taiwan not be swallowed by the CCP, because it is far better to let some people live free than have us all suffer under slavery. ” I hope President Trump has this Chinese shitzen’s political wisdom to break the One China spell, which would help him make America greater.,": "115964",
    "Wracked by arthritis, bitten by ticks, and murdered atop an icy mountain 5, 300 years ago, Otzi the “Iceman” also carried   bacteria, scientists reported on Thursday. The Heliobacter pylori bacteria was retrieved from the mummified stomach of the ancient    man killed by an arrow wound and frozen in the Alps, who was uncovered by hikers in 1991. H. pylori is now the oldest microbe to be genetically mapped. Otzi has been studied for two decades for insight into early Europeans  —   he died wearing elaborate fur clothing, armed with a copper axe, and covered with 61 tattoos (making him the oldest known tattooed man). Now researchers are examining his gut microbes, or microbiome, for more clues to the life and death of the Iceman. “He had a very rough life,” study lead author Frank Maixner of the European Academy of   in Italy told reporters at a telephone briefing. “We cannot be 100% certain he suffered gastric distress but we can say his immune system was reacting to the bacteria. ” Today, roughly half of all people worldwide are infected by H. pylori, which lives in the acidic human stomach and about 10% of the time causes ulcers. Varied strains of the bacteria are tied to populations across the world, with   Europeans afflicted by a unique one that appears to be a mixture of older African and Asian ones. But not Otzi, according to the new study, published in the journal Science. The complete genetic map, or genome, of the H. pylori bacteria found in his frozen stomach shows it belongs to an Asian strain of bacteria now largely confined to the guts of people living in northern India. That suggests the north Indian strain once belonged to most prehistoric Europeans, prior to an influx of farmers from the Middle East into the continent more than 4, 000 years ago. Those new arrivals likely carried the African H. pylori strain that mixed with the older Asian one to produce today’s signature European H. pylori bugs. “To actually sequence the genome of a pathogen this old is a dream come true,” ancient microbe expert Gary   of the University of Puerto Rico, who was not involved in the new study, told BuzzFeed News. “The beautiful thing is the paper sheds light on one hypothesis about ancient human migration, which is wonderful. ” While studies of human gut microbes, the microbiome, have run rampant in the last decade, the field of paleomicrobiology is only blooming now with the Otzi study,   added. “The microbiome is absolutely essential to what makes us human, we couldn’t survive without these microbes,” he said. “So to glimpse what they looked like a long time ago is really important. ” To sequence the genes of the ancient gut bugs, the researchers first retrieved samples of Otzi’s stomach lining and the   contents of his stomach, which previous researchers had shown contained last meals of goat, deer, and bread. Mixed in were DNA segments from H. pylori bacteria, which the team painstakingly knitted into a complete genetic map of the bugs. Poor preservation of Otzi’s stomach lining means the researchers couldn’t tell whether he suffered from ulcers. However, the scientists did find proteins expressed by the human immune system in reaction to an H. pylori infection. “He probably had some stomach issues,” Maixner said. H. pylori is probably as old as our species, Homo sapiens, perhaps dating back to 116, 000 years ago. (And around 50, 000 years ago, lions appear to have captured their own strain of the   bacteria by eating people.) Carried out of Africa by human migrations around 60, 000 years ago, today’s Northern Indian strain of H. pylori may reflect an ancient lineage of stomach bugs. In Northeast Africa a newer strain evolved within the last 52, 000 years, to later mix with the bugs today giving ulcers to people across Europe. “A real, but unintended, message here is that Europe has been the destination of many a migrant,” study author Yoshan Moodley of South Africa’s University of Venda told BuzzFeed News by email. “And that migration into and away from any place in the world is as old as mankind. ”": "103494",
    "Argentina’s social security agency, responsible for 43 percent of the federal government’s budget, expects the program’s deficit this year to exceed the 0. 4 percent of GDP in 2016, the executive director said in an interview on Tuesday. A higher deficit from the agency could complicate President Mauricio Macri’s plans to cut Argentina’s overall budget deficit without getting rid of social benefits in a congressional election year. ”The deficit will be bigger because we are reaching the limit of pension coverage. We have coverage of about 98 percent (of the population),” said Emilio Basavilbaso, director of the agency known as Anses. ”It is a clear sign that we did not come here to reduce social benefits.” Macri, who took office in December 2015 promising to end   populism, is trying to lower the fiscal deficit from 4. 6 percent of gross domestic product in 2016 to 4. 2 percent this year and 3. 2 percent in 2018. He seeks a better credit rating and more investment to fuel economic growth.  Basavilbaso said Congress could start to discuss a pension reform by the end of the year. He offered few details but said privatizing the pension system was not an option. ”There are other countries that have a manageable deficit, such as we have now, but if we do nothing, it would be irresponsible for the future,” Basavilbaso said. According to calculations from consulting firm Ecolatina, Anses’s pension fund increased its expenditures by 44 percent while its revenues grew by only 32 percent in 2016, when Argentina’s economy was emerging from recession. Anses received some 135 billion pesos ($8. 66 billion) from a tax amnesty that ended in March but by law can only use the funds to pay retirees and settle court cases with pensioners who claimed they were underpaid.  Anses’s investment fund totaled $55. 23 billion in 2016, growing 13. 5 percent from the previous year. Some opposition politicians have criticized the fund for buying government bonds. ”We are investing every peso in the fund, not spending,” Basavilbaso said. ”That is why we had a profit five times greater than in the previous government.”  (Writing by Caroline Stauffer; Editing by Cynthia Osterman) TOKYO Japan’s central bank will cut its inflation forecasts but hold off expanding stimulus this month, people familiar with the matter say, in another sign the bank is retreating from Governor Haruhiko Kuroda’s initial pledge to do whatever it takes to achieve his ambitious inflation target.

    "GOP vice presidential nominee Mike Pence called out the mainstream media on Saturday for focusing most of their time trying to parse Donald Trump’s words than investigating the scandals that have followed the Clintons throughout their political careers.  “The media is so busy parsing what Donald Trump said in the last 30 minutes that they keep ignoring what the Clintons have been doing for the last 30 years,” Pence said Saturday at Patrick Henry College in Virginia. The Indiana Governor called the mainstream press “the party in power” and said they, along with Democrats, “all keep telling each other that the usual methods are going to work” to take down Trump and “then they wake up the next morning  …     and Donald Trump is still standing fighting for the American people and fighting to make this country great and strong again. ” Pence said Trump has to battle Clinton and the media on the campaign trail as the mainstream press ignore the “cascade of controversies and questionable conduct that flows out of the Clinton years. ” Pence slammed Clinton for using a private server and deleting her emails with BleachBit. He mentioned that the FBI tried to open up a criminal investigation into the Clinton Foundation but the Obama administration blocked it. He also reminded voters that the FBI found 15, 000 more Clinton emails that were not turned over while others proved that Clinton’s State Department gave expedited access to foundation donors. He also blasted the Obama administration for deciding not to provide Clinton’s    schedule at the State Department until after the election after an Associated Press report found that half of her meetings were with foundation donors while reviewing half of her State Department schedule. “Now let me get this straight,” Pence said. “So it would be a conflict of interest to accept foreign and corporate donations to your foundation if you were president, but it wasn’t a conflict of interest to accept foreign donations while you were Secretary of State?” He said the Clinton Foundation should be shut down and the Justice Department should appoint a special prosector. Pence said Americans are “sick and tired of pay to play politics in Washington, D. C. ” and “it’s the kind of politics that will come to a crashing end” when Trump is elected. Pence added that “the days of the rigged system of the favored few will come to an end and Donald Trump’s only special interest will be you, the American people. ”": "39098",
    "INDIANAPOLIS  —   Now that the losing streak is over, Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek had a new dilemma: how to divvy up minutes at point guard after undrafted rookie Ron Baker led an unlikely   comeback in Milwaukee that ended the Knicks’   slide Friday. Derrick Rose, whom Hornacek had critiqued earlier Friday, sat out the entire fourth quarter in the   stunner in Milwaukee  . “I believe in my teammates,” said Rose, who shot    against the Bucks. “He made a decision to go with Ron. As a teammate, I can’t get mad at that. Ron works his [butt] off, so I understand. ” Asked if it was weird to sit the fourth, Rose said, “A little. We were in desperate mode. We just needed a win. Hopefully that will   something. ’’         Baker is here for the duration. The Knicks needed to waive Baker by Saturday night to have him clear waivers before the Jan. 10 deadline, otherwise his contract is guaranteed for the year. If there was any doubt, Baker’s performance Friday sealed it. “At the beginning of the year, I had a meeting with Jeff and he had mentioned something about January,’’ Baker said. “If I stayed on the right path as I did in preseason, I’ll be fine. I wasn’t concerned after that meeting, but I’m trying to keep improving obviously. ’’ The easiest thing to do is put Baker, an undrafted rookie out of Wichita State, back into his   role he has had essentially all season  —   except one night in Phoenix, where he also led a   rally before being yanked for Brandon Jennings late. Jennings, after a solid first month and a half, has seen his play drop of late. Baker notched six points, four assists, no turnovers and made big free throws in his   gem, coming in with the club down 13 points. Baker also drew an important late charge. “Obviously he’s really proud of my effort in the fourth quarter,’’ Baker said. Baker has been a favorite of Hornacek’s since the Knicks signed him after he went undraft. Baker told The Post   as both were lightly regarded shooting guards who spent four years in college. Asked the similarities, Hornacek said Saturday night: “I had bad hair, too. We’re both guys coming in the league  —   nothing flashy, getting guys in the right spots, realizing your role is getting guys the ball who need it. When I came to the league, I had Walter Davis, Alvin Adams, I knew I’m going to get it to one of these guys. When Ron gets in there, he gets it to Carmelo and KP and makes the right play. He’s a smart, heady guy. I don’t have to call plays when he has the ball. He’s smart enough to just do that. ’’ Told about the bad hair comment, the   Baker said, “I’m not going to agree with that quote. ’’ Hornacek likes how Baker orchestrates the offense and that the club can run more triangle sets with him at point, as opposed to Rose, whose major attribute is penetrating for buckets. However, Rose’s recent low shooting percentage  —   without the benefit of drawing fouls  —   has concerned Hornacek. When Rose drives and misses, he’s out of the play, and teams usually score in transition. Hornacek went as far as saying “95 percent’’ of Rose’s misses turn into baskets the other way. “Obviously, whenever my name is called, that’s the opportunity,’’ Baker said. “I can’t check myself into the game. It’s up to the coaching staff. I’m a team guy. There’s different matchups each and I just have to prepare the best I can. ’’": "122798",
    "The Trump administration has begun the detail work of stiffening the country’s immigration infrastructure, according to an internal memo from the Department of Homeland Security, moving to speed the hiring of border agents, to find space to detain thousands more immigrants and to hasten deportation cases. Even as the federal courts trip up President Trump’s ban on travelers from several predominantly Muslim countries and Congress signals it is in no rush to pay for a border wall, the administration is pushing the vast border enforcement network to begin choking off illegal immigration. Homeland Security’s plan to greatly expand its Border Patrol has been known for some time and includes adding about 5, 000 agents, in part by allowing some applicants to skip the polygraph test that is required for all prospective hires. That proposal has been praised by Border Patrol agents, who say the polygraph is excessively difficult, and questioned by some experts, who say the test is needed to screen out drug cartel members and other problematic hires. The memo, which was first reported by The Washington Post, outlined several other ways in which the administration is considering relaxing hiring standards and stepping up recruitment. Beyond removing the polygraph hurdle, the memo discusses eliminating a part of the entrance exam that tests the Spanish language skills of prospective hires, explaining that “few applicants fail the entrance exam solely because of these tests. ” New agents will still have to obtain “the appropriate level of proficiency in Spanish” to graduate from the academy, the memo says. All applicants must now pass two physical fitness tests, but the memo suggests that only one of the tests will count toward deciding whether to hire a Customs and Border Protection officer or a Border Patrol agent. Those who do not meet physical fitness standards at the academy, the document says, will “receive additional training. ” The memo is only a “draft that hasn’t made it to the front office yet,” said David Lapan, a spokesman for the department. “Anything in it is subject to change. ” James Tomsheck, a former assistant commissioner for internal affairs at Customs and Border Protection, said any attempt to speed hiring by lowering standards leaves the agency vulnerable to corrupt or compromised agents. “I can’t see how this makes the border any more secure,” he said, calling the polygraph change “preposterous. ” Even if more applicants qualify, the agency lacks the capacity or the money to process them quickly. By March, it took an average of about 300 days to hire a border agent, according to the memo, though that was an improvement over the   average in January 2016. The administration has already asked Congress to appropriate more than $60 million to help speed hiring, including money to encourage agents to move to less desirable regions along the border and expand recruiting efforts. Some of the money will help extend Customs and Border Protection’s outreach efforts at high schools and colleges and amplify its social media presence in order “to reach the millennial generation,” the memo says. Though the number of people apprehended at the border has fallen sharply in recent months and some detention beds are now empty, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has found 27 private and government facilities with 21, 000 more potential beds for detention, according to the document. But it notes that the agency does not have the money to pay for them. The administration also wants Mexico to agree to hold   immigrants while their cases go through American immigration courts. To speed those hearings, the administration is considering holding them by videoconference or sending more immigration judges to the border. The memo also says that more than 50 police departments are interested in partnering with the federal agency to help enforce immigration laws, a program known as 287( g) that the Obama administration dropped amid concerns that it encouraged racial profiling and other abuses. The agency is already in the process of signing on 26 other jurisdictions.": "20080",
    "Los Angeles (CNN) Amber Heard has made good on her promise to give the millions she received from her divorce settlement with Johnny Depp to charity.  Heard distributed her $7 million settlement between two organizations    Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles and the ACLU, which will put its portion of the funds toward efforts to stop violence against women.  ”As described in the restraining order and divorce settlement, money played no role for me personally and never has, except to the extent that I could donate it to charity and, in doing so, hopefully help those less able to defend themselves,” Heard said in a statement via her publicist. ”This is over and above any funds that I have given away in the past and will continue to give away in the future.” Heard and Depp came to the settlement on Tuesday, one day before they were scheduled to appear in court.   Heard had previously accused Depp of domestic abuse and got a restraining order against the actor in May.   Heard said she has been a volunteer for Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles for over 10 years and seen ”firsthand how more funding for staffing, better equipment and better medication can make the difference between life or death for a child.”  ”I know these organizations will put the funds to good use and look forward to continuing to support them in the future,” she said. ”Hopefully, this experience results in a positive change in the lives of people who need it the most.”  Anthony D.

    "Former Penn State president Graham Spanier was convicted Friday of child endangerment for his role in the sexual abuse scandal involving former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky. In a split verdict, the Pennsylvania jury found that Spanier’s handling of a 2001 complaint alleging abuse by Sandusky, warranted conviction on one of three charges against him. The jury did, however, acquit Spanier of conspiracy and a second count of child endangerment, the Associated Press reports. Pennlive reports the case against Spanier as such: ”Prosecutors had argued that Spanier broke the law when, after receiving a 2001 report that graduate assistant Mike McQueary had seen Sandusky naked with a young boy in the showers at Penn State’s Lasch Building, he did not demand that it be reported immediately to child protection authorities. ”The result, prosecutor Patrick Schulte said in opening statements Monday, was that ”evil in the form of Jerry Sandusky was allowed to run wild” for another decade. Prosecutors maintained that Sandusky sexually assaulted at least three more boys before he was charged with a crime in 2011.” As we’ve previously reported, several Penn State officials, including the school’s   football coach Joe Paterno, were fired or resigned in the wake of the scandal. Sandusky was arrested and eventually convicted of 45 counts of sexual abuse for molesting 10 boys over a   period. He is currently serving a term of   years in prison. Earlier this year, two of Spanier’s former administrators pleaded guilty to misdemeanors and were expected to testify against their former boss.

    "Donald Trump and Paul Ryan had their   meeting on this morning, and while Ryan did not endorse Trump (yet) they issued a joint statement talking about their “many areas of common ground. ” Speaking afterward to reporters, Ryan said, “It was important that we discussed our differences that we have, but it was also important that we discuss the core principles that tie us together,” and that “Going forward we’re going to go a little deeper in the policy weeds to make sure we have a better understanding of one another. ” This is a fool’s errand, not just for Ryan but for us in the media as well. And it poses a profound challenge to democracy itself. Just in the last couple of days, something has changed. Perhaps it should have been evident to us before, but for whatever reason it was only partially clear. The pieces were there, but they didn’t fit together to show us how comprehensive Trump’s assault on the fundamentals of American politics truly is. And that has left the media  —   whose job it is to report what’s happening and describe it to the citizenry in a coherent way that enables them to make a reasonable decision  —   at loose ends. We simply don’t know how to cover a candidate like this. We need to figure it out, and quickly.    Donald Trump and Speaker Paul Ryan met on May 12. The result? A lot of cameras, and not much else. (Peter   Washington Post)   The foundation of democratic debate is policy, issues, the choices we make about what we as a nation should do. That’s what the government we create does on our behalf: it confronts problems, decides between alternatives, and pursues them. That’s also the foundation of how we in the press report on politics. Yes, we spend a lot of time talking about the personalities involved, but underneath that are competing ideas about what should be done. Should we raise taxes or lower them? Spend more or spend less? Make abortions easier or harder to get? Give more people health coverage or fewer? How do we combat ISIS? How should we address climate change? How can we improve the economy? How can we reduce crime? What sort of transportation system do we want? Which areas should government involve itself in, and which should it stay out of? We all presume that these questions (and a thousand more) are important, and that the people who run for office should take them seriously. We assume they’ll tell us where they stand, we’ll decide what we think of what they’ve said, and eventually we’ll be able to make an informed choice about who should be the leader of our country. Donald Trump has taken these presumptions and torn them to pieces, then spat on them and laughed. And so far we seem to have no idea what to do about it. Let me briefly give an illustration. On the question of the minimum wage, Trump has previously said he would not raise it. Then Sunday he said he did want to raise it. Then in a separate interview on the very same day he said there should be no federal minimum wage at all, that instead we should “Let the states decide. ” Then yesterday he said he does want to increase the federal minimum wage. So when you ask the question, “Where does Donald Trump stand on the minimum wage?” the answer is: everywhere and nowhere. He has nothing resembling a position, because what he said today has no relationship to what he said yesterday or what he’ll say tomorrow. And we’re seeing it again and again. Will he release his tax returns? Yes, but then no, but then yes and no. Does he want to cut taxes for the wealthy? His plan says yes, his mouth sort of says no, but who knows? What about his promise for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States” that so thrilled his supporters? Now he says it’s “only a suggestion. ” We assume that with an appropriately tough and smart interview, one or more of us in the media will eventually pin Trump down on any particular issue, and then we’ll have our answer and he can be judged accordingly. But that won’t happen. So because we don’t know what else to do, we’re trying to hold him to the standards we use for every other candidate: what does he propose, and how reasonable are those proposals? For instance, Politico attempted to take a serious look at Trump’s policy statements, and concluded that “Trump bounces across the political spectrum,” but “Many of his proposals are either unrealistic in terms of executive power or would run into a brick wall with Congress, making a Trump administration borderline impotent on the very issues that are driving his supporters to the polls. ” We should give them credit for trying, but the problem is that if you want to evaluate Trump’s positions, you can only do so based on what they’ve been up until the moment you’re making the judgment. But if he gets asked about the same issues tomorrow, the odds that he’ll take the same position are essentially random, like a coin flip. The problem isn’t that Trump’s positions don’t add up to a coherent ideology along the   spectrum, it’s that you can’t even call them “positions,” because you can never be sure which of them he’ll hold next week, much less if he eventually becomes president. And remember, that’s really the point of the campaign: to figure out what kind of president each of the contenders would be. There’s always some measure of uncertainty, since we don’t know exactly what crises the next president will confront or what kind of manager he or she would be. But with every other person who ran this year, an informed observer could tell you 90 percent of what they would do if they eventually became president. You might love or hate Hillary Clinton, but we can all come to at least a basic agreement about the policies she’ll pursue. At this point, can anybody say what Trump would do as president? About anything? It’s important to be clear that Trump isn’t just a “ . ” When that charge has been leveled in the past, whether against a Democrat or Republican, it was because they had one position (or set of positions) and then changed them. Even if the critique was animated by the concern that they might change again in the future, at any given moment you knew where they stood. You might judge them too opportunistic, or like their previous position more than their current one. But there was a progression and a logic to where they stood, and the assumption was that whatever their position was, they’d act on it. This is the way we’ve tried to explain Trump, assuming that there’s some kind of linear progression to what he says about issues: he was in one place appealing to primary voters, and there are things he might change to appeal to general election voters. But it’s clear now that that was a mistake, because that’s now how this works with him. That leaves us unable to talk about Trump and issues in the way we normally would. And this is a serious problem. The basic issue divides between the parties comprise one of the key foundations on which we build our explanations of politics. They structure the arguments and the contest for power, they give meaning to the whole game. They’re the reason all of this silliness matters, because at the end of it we’ll be choosing a new government, led by one individual who will make choices that affect all of us in profound ways. It’s clear now that Donald Trump may be unique in American history  —   not just in his inexperience, not just in his ignorance, not just in his bombast, and not just in his   appeal. He’s unique in that he doesn’t care in the least about the the things that politics and government are all about, and he won’t even bother to pretend he does. I’ll confess that I don’t know where this leaves us in the media, and how we should approach his candidacy from this point forward in order to help the public understand it. But that may be the most important question we need to answer right now.": "211905",
    "’Read Melania Trump’s lawsuit here’] Melania Trump filed a lawsuit Thursday against the Daily Mail and a Maryland political blogger for defamation for publishing what she said are false stories about her past. Trump is suing the outlets  —   which include Webster Griffin Tarpley, who runs Tarpley. net, a political website  —   over stories that claimed she worked as a “  escort” and that she suffered from a “  nervous breakdown” due to the stress of the campaigning, according to her complaint. The suit said Trump is suing each outlet for “in excess” of $75, 000  —   her lawyer said she will seek $150 million. Trump states in her lawsuit that those accusations are blatantly false. “[Trump] did legitimate and legal modeling work for legitimate business entities,” the complaint states. “[Trump] was not an escort or prostitute. [Trump] did not have an apoplectic fit, apoplectic tantrum, nervous breakdown or mental breakdown, nor is she terrified or obsessed by fear about revelations from her past. ” Trump’s lawyer, Charles Harder, who recently represented Hulk Hogan in his battle with Gawker, released this statement on behalf of his client: “These defendants made several statements about Mrs. Trump that are 100% false and tremendously damaging to her personal and professional reputation. Defendants broadcast their lies to millions of people throughout the U. S. and the world —  without any justification,” he said. “Their many lies include, among others, that Mrs. Trump supposedly was an “escort” in the 1990s before she met her husband. Defendants’ actions are so egregious, malicious and harmful to Mrs. Trump that her damages are estimated at $150 million dollars. ” The Daily Mail responded Thursday to the lawsuit publishing a lengthy retraction. In the retraction, the newspaper states their article merely discussed allegations that were made about Trump in a book on Amazon and in an article by a Slovenian magazine. But the newspaper said it did not intend to state that the allegations that Trump worked as an escort or in the sex business were true. “To the extent that anything in the Daily Mail’s article was interpreted as stating or suggesting that Mrs. Trump worked as an ‘escort’ or in the ‘sex business,’ that she had a ‘composite or presentation card for the sex business,’ or that either of the modeling agencies referenced in the article were engaged in these businesses, it is hereby retracted, and the Daily Mail newspaper regrets any such misinterpretation. ” Tarpley also responded saying Trump’s lawsuit against him is “without merit. ” Tarpley said he is confident that Trump will not be able to prove the statements about her on his website were defamatory. He added, “her lawsuit is a blatant attempt to intimidate not only me but journalists of all stripes into remaining silent with regard to public figures. This lawsuit is a direct affront to First Amendment principles and free speech in our democratic society. ”": "110186",
    "(CNN) Amy’s Kitchen Inc. says it’s recalling nearly 74, 000 cases of its products that could contain listeria. In a statement released through the Food and Drug Administration on Sunday, Amy’s Kitchen said that it was voluntarily recalling the products after learning from one of its suppliers that it may have received organic spinach that was possibly contaminated with listeria monocytogenes.  The   organic and natural food company said it wasn’t aware of any reports of illness connected with its products, but was recalling them ”out of an abundance of caution.” The recalled products, which are listed on the FDA’s website and were distributed throughout the United States and Canada, include multiple types of vegetable lasagna, tofu scrambles, spinach pizza, enchiladas, brown rice and vegetable bowls and stuffed pasta shells.

    "In an impassioned speech on Monday, Mayor Bill de Blasio sought to reassure New Yorkers fearful of Donald Trump’s incoming administration, by vowing to reject some of the  ’s most controversial policies and to address the multiple incidents of hate which have plagued the city since election night. Speaking to a packed auditorium in New York where people spilled into the hallway, New York’s mayor outlined how the city would resist some of the  ’s campaign promises. “We will use all the tools at our disposal to stand up for our people,” he vowed. “If all Muslims are required to register, we will take legal action to block it. If the federal government wants our police officers to tear immigrant families apart, we will refuse to do it. ” “If the justice department orders local police to resume    we will not comply. We won’t trade in neighborhood policing for racial profiling,” he continued to applause. “If there are threats to federal funding for Planned Parenthood of New York City, we will ensure women receive the healthcare they need. If Jews, or Muslims, or members of the LGBT community, or any community, are victimized and attacked, we will find their attackers, we will arrest them, we will prosecute them. ” De Blasio had an extended meeting with the   at Trump Tower last week. In his address, he recounted his visit, during which, he said, he had implored Trump to remember where he came from.  “I thought it was important to go to the   and let him hear what so many New Yorkers were feeling,” he said. “And my essential message to him was to remember where you come from. ” “There was a time when the values of New York City were under attack on the debate stage.   Trump at the time stood up for New York,” he continued, recalling Ted Cruz’s comments that Trump had New York values and was not a true conservative. “I hope he remembers every day what he saw, over all those years in the city, and doesn’t lose track of the very things that allowed him and countless others an opportunity. ” Following Trump’s electoral victory, there have been multiple reports of incidents of hate against a number of groups across the country. The Southern Poverty Law center has counted 701 incidents between 9 and 16 November. Despite its opposition to Trump, New York City has not been immune to the rising number of hate incidents since Trump’s victory. According to the SPLC, New York state had the third highest number of reported hateful incidents. Swastikas have been found   across the city since the election, including in university student dorms, the sidewalk in a predominantly Jewish neighborhood and the door of an elected official.  A rally was held in a park in a Brooklyn after a swastika with the words “Go Trump” was found   on to playground equipment. Hundreds attended the rally, where Beastie Boys member Adam “ ” Horovitz spoke as the park was named after his deceased bandmate, Adam Yauch, who was Jewish. Reports of Islamophobia have also been on the rise. On a bus in Queens, a couple allegedly told a    Muslim woman to remove her hijab. Also in Queens, an Arab Uber driver was reportedly told by another motorist he was a terrorist who would be deported now that Trump was president.  New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, said he had established a special unit of the state police to address rising hate crimes, as well as a number of other civil rights initiatives. New York City’s police commissioner, James O’Neill, said on Sunday that there had been a 31% uptick in hate crimes compared with the same time last year, increasing from 250 incidents to 328. Speaking to a talk radio show, he suggested that the rise was related to the campaign. “I have no scientific evidence as to why, but if you’ve been paying attention to what’s been going on in the country over the last year or so, that the rhetoric has increased, I think that might have something to do with it,” he said. Cuomo and De Blasio, both Democrats, were outspoken in their opposition to Trump during the presidential campaign. Trump called De Blasio “one of the most incompetent men” and the “single worst mayor in the history of New York City” while De Blasio said of Trump last month: “It’s impossible he could be a good president”. New York City faces the prospect of losing billions of dollars in federal funding due to Trump’s presidency as the   has vowed to cut funding for   sanctuary cities  —   cities that limit how much they cooperate with federal law enforcement officials in detaining undocumented immigrants. However, De Blasio is in a unique position as Trump owns properties in New York City, and the mayor still holds influence over decisions that could affect them. Despite the prospect of losing federal funding, the mayor struck a defiant tone on Monday, and vowed to protect undocumented immigrants. “This is New York. Nothing about who we are changed on election day. ”": "151347",

    "Former House speaker Newt Gingrich, a stalwart supporter of President Trump, used a   appearance on “Fox and Friends” to spread the conspiracy theory that former Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was killed last year to cover up the true story of how WikiLeaks obtained tens of thousands of hacked Democratic Party emails. “We have this very strange story now of this young man who worked for the Democratic National Committee, who apparently was assassinated at 4 in the morning, having given WikiLeaks something like 53, 000 emails and 17, 000 attachments,” Gingrich said. “Nobody’s investigating that, and what does that tell you about what’s going on?

There is no evidence that he was “disgusted by the corruption of the Democratic National Committee,” though last week, amateur sleuths falsely claimed that Rich had posted online as “pandas4bernie. ” (He may have tweeted as “panda4progress. ”) There’s also no evidence that Rich contacted WikiLeaks. Until this week, conspiracy theorists had suggested that the hacker Guccifer 2. 0 used Rich to get into DNC servers, based on possibly altered direct messages between Guccifer 2. 0 and a model named Robbin Young. The new theories, which were covered on Fox News even as the source recanted, rely not on criminal evidence but on the fact that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange offered a reward for information about Rich’s killing and gave a meandering   when asked whether Rich was his source. But as the investigation into Russia’s role has picked up steam, Hannity and others have latched on to any suggestion that a source might emerge and link Rich to the DNC hack, though the FBI had spotted   hacks as long ago as September 2015.

    "(CNN) Days after a raid on an al Qaeda compound in Yemen led to the first US military combat death under Donald Trump, the leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula released an audio message taunting the new American President. In an   recording, AQAP leader Qassim   condemned the January 29 raid, saying, ”The new fool of the White House received a painful slap across his face.”  The message was released online Saturday and translated by the SITE Intelligence Group. In the recording, Rimi also claimed ”dozens of Americans were killed and wounded,” a number starkly at odds with the US account, which reported the death of one Navy SEAL, Chief Petty Officer William ”Ryan” Owens. Three additional SEALs also were wounded. Rimi acknowledged the deaths of 14 men and 11 women and children in the raid, a joint counterterrorism effort between the United States and United Arab Emirates. A senior US military official told CNN on Monday that Rimi was a target of the operation. The recording was released after last week’s raid. Trump is using Obama as a security blanket, Civilian deaths, Reportedly among the dead was the    the daughter of Anwar   the late   cleric who directed attacks against the United States. Awlaki was killed in 2011. Reprieve, a   nongovernmental organization, and a   human rights worker told CNN that at least 23 civilians were killed in the attack. ”When the Americans escaped, they dragged their killed and wounded, and they found no other alternative but to destroy their own planes so that it would not be proof of their scandal,” Rimi said. The senior US military official told CNN on Monday that intelligence collection wasn’t the only objective of the Yemen raid but that it had also targeted Rimi.  In the event Rimi wasn’t there, the US military believed it would find intelligence that would help lead to him, the official said.    the mission was not dependent on   being there, however, a senior US military official emphasized.  US Central Command, which oversees forces in the region, and the Pentagon are strongly denying   was an objective of the raid. On Tuesday, Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis said, ”There was never any intention, hope, anticipation or plan that he would be part of this operation.” ”It wasn’t a   target mission,” Col. John Thomas told CNN, referring to operations aimed at killing or capturing terrorist leaders. Thomas added no hard intelligence indicated a ”high possibility” Rimi was at the compound on the night of the raid, saying that Navy SEALs would have captured any leaders of the al Qaeda affiliate, including Rimi, as part of an   operation.  ”Anyone found on site would have been taken,” Thomas said. NBC first reported that Rimi was a target of the raid.  The chance to take out such a pivotal member of al Qaeda may explain the large allocation of resources used in the mission. Military botches release of video seized in Yemen raid, Raid missteps, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula fighters detected the SEAL team before it reached its objective, leading to an intense firefight. Following news of the raid, the military had said the goal of the mission was to gather intelligence on the al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen.

[Previous story, published at 11:25 a. m.] A school bus slammed into a tree and split apart Monday, killing at least six children in Chattanooga, Tennessee, officials said. Frantic parents arrived at the scene, screaming and crying. A spokeswoman for the Hamilton County District Attorney’s Office confirmed the death toll. But Chattanooga Police Chief Fred Fletcher would only say ”multiple children” were killed, declining to specify how many died because the scene was still active. Fletcher said the bus, which was carrying 35 students in kindergarten through   from Woodmore Elementary School, turned over on its side and struck the tree. Authorities received a call about the crash just before 3:30 p. m. and emergency officials worked for ”many hours” to remove all the children from the bus, he said.  Fletcher said 23 victims were transported to Erlanger Hospital in Chattanooga.  Speed is a possible factor, ”Certainly, speed is being investigated very, very strongly as a factor in this crash,” Fletcher said, adding that the investigation was still at an early stage.  He added that driving conditions were clear and dry.  Fletcher said ”a warrant has been issued to remove the informational box on the school bus and review the video.” Police said the bus driver is cooperative and talking to investigators.  Fletcher said the families of the victims were still being notified Monday night.  ”Taking care of the children that are injured is our No. 1 priority. Taking care of the families who are looking for, caring for and grieving for children is our second priority,” Fletcher said. He added: ”Our thoughts, our prayers and all of our efforts are with the families of these children and others impacted by this tragedy.” The National Transportation Safety Board said it would send a team to Chattanooga early Tuesday, according to a tweet from the federal agency’s account.  ’That’s my baby’ At the scene, parents were heard crying and screaming ”that’s my baby” as they arrived,   WTVC reported. A woman who lives near the crash told CNN affiliate WDEF the impact was so powerful it knocked her power out. ”I just heard a big boom,” the woman said.  Fletcher, in a press conference, called the crash scene ”a complicated crime scene” that covered a large area.  ”What has happened today is every public safety official’s absolute worst nightmare, but that is nothing in comparison to the nightmare that families and friends and our community is going through with this tragic loss to children in our community,” Fletcher said.  Melydia Clewell, the spokeswoman from the district attorney’s office, said at least five children died on the scene, and one died at a hospital.  Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker called the crash ”heartbreaking” in a tweet.  A tweet from the Chattanooga Fire Department showed the bus on its side and up against a tree as emergency officials extricated the last patient through the back door. ’Hundreds and hundreds’ of donors giving blood, Blood Assurance, a blood bank in the Chattanooga area, extended its hours at three locations, as ”hundreds and hundreds” of donors flocked to give blood to treat crash victims, said Mindy Quinn of Blood Assurance.  ”We have had people who were refusing to leave until they give blood,” Quinn said.

    "These arguments exist within a tradition of using the specter of fraud to legally suppress votes on a racial basis. But for decades that tradition has relied on a wink and a nod —  openly stating the discriminatory intent of laws that had the clear effect of disenfranchisement could be legally troublesome. The dog whistle is the key. The Toxic Health Effects of Deportation Threat, Just days into his term, President Donald Trump opened a new chapter in this long history, using the White House pulpit to make claims of massive voter fraud, and calling for changes in voting law. But in relaying an anecdote to congressional leaders intended to support his wholly unsubstantiated claims of millions of fraudulent votes from undocumented immigrants, Trump directly referred to the perceived ethnicity and nationality of suspect voters, instead of actual suspicions of fraudulent acts. In doing so, Trump broke the longstanding taboo of relying on racial insinuation to carry the implied threat of suppression. The story, as reported in the New York Times, is bizarre. According to multiple sources, at a reception for House and Senate leaders Trump relayed a story meant to back his wild claims of fraud. That story involved German golfer Bernhard Langer. Three sources claim that Langer —  a German citizen ineligible to vote in the United States —  saw voter fraud by people he presumably believed to be undocumented immigrants, while trying to vote unsuccessfully himself. Another source contradicts this account, saying the story was relayed to Langer by a friend who was eligible to vote. But both accounts agree that Trump’s take from Langer was that a group of voters presumably of Latin American origin “did not look as if they should be allowed to vote,” as paraphrased by the newspaper. This was a bullhorn where we’d usually expect a more savvy  . As recently as the latest election cycle, the dog whistle was king. Republicans sounded the alarm early and often about reports of mass   voter fraud, despite no evidence that it exists. Republicans also rallied around the suspicion of undocumented immigrants registering to vote —  again, a claim that remains unsubstantiated. Both of these claims that themselves invoke a certain threat of people of color and immigrants voting were used to justify voter suppression. Although the courts struck down some of the most egregious voting laws like North Carolina’s with its racial “surgical precision,” on the whole there were more voting restrictions in place in 2016 than in previous elections. Further, those laws were likely just a prelude to a slow dance of legal challenges that could seriously weaken the Voting Rights Act under a Trump administration. Trump himself played along with the   game on the campaign trail. Without evidence, he repeatedly claimed that there were millions of cases of voter fraud in favor of Democrats. He also implied that he might not accept the results of the election as legitimate based on that falsehood, though he later reversed that position after he won the election. But Trump did play by the rules of the   game in using the cover of voter fraud to advocate for policies with histories and implications steeped in racism, such as   and intimidation in Democratic strongholds in neighborhoods of color. Despite the apparent contradiction of claiming a legitimate victory and also maintaining a claim that millions of people cast votes illegally, Trump carried these claims into office, becoming the first president to demand an investigation into an election he won. The genesis of these claims seems largely rooted in ego and perhaps a touch of distraction —  Trump has been clearly rankled by losing the popular vote, and a focus on vilifying an   of minorities for tainting an election could serve as a   pressure valve amid swirling allegations of Russian interference on his behalf. But Trump has also tied these claims of voter fraud to the larger Republican aim of “strengthen[ing] up voting procedures. ” In clarifying statements, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer outlined that the investigation would focus on states and places that did not vote for Trump. How much distance is there between such an investigation and an imposition of draconian voter rules on communities of color? Historically, not much. The game that Spicer is playing here relies on the things unsaid as much as the things said. In the wake of the Voting Rights Act and 52 years of changes in polite society since, naked voter suppression through outright violence and legal mechanisms openly targeted at black Americans has become anathema. The rabid segregationists of old were no longer tolerated, but the campaign to reduce the voting power of minorities —  especially in the shadow of the old Jim Crow —  continued apace, and picked up steam, respectability, and a sheen of intellectualism along the way. And the campaign continued so in a manner where intent no longer mattered. After the 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision rolled back federal oversight in southern elections for the first time since the   era, it’s no coincidence that many of those states moved immediately to restrict voting and in North Carolina introduced the legislation on the same day as the decision. Emboldened by United States Chief Justice Roberts’s declaration in the Court’s opinion of that case that the country has changed since 1965, those states seemed intent on proving Justice Ginsburg’s dissenting opinion that the law’s protections themselves had been the source of those changes, and not an eradication of the underlying instinct to disenfranchise. Armed with that decision, so long as they don’t mention race and stick to the script of things like “ballot integrity,” conservatives can likely convince friendly courts and a friendly Department of Justice that increasingly restrictive voting laws do not violate the 14th and 15th Amendments, despite the clear   impact that things like voter ID laws do have. As long as they play the   game, the road appears to be open. Trump has since attempted to back up his claims with misrepresented data from a Pew study, as well as some unreleased reports from voting app VoteStand and its founder Gregg Phillips, a company that does not have comprehensive access to voter data and a person who has not been established as a credible source or expert on voting in any way. In other words, he’s corrected his position back to the standard Republican talking points of using unsubstantiated, shoddy, or willfully misinterpreted data to support claims of fraud, and thus an agenda of more restrictive voting laws that only discriminate in effect, not in intent. But in his story about Bavarian golfers and “Latin American” voters, Trump perhaps inadvertently ushered in a new era. One of the strongest unofficial powers of the office is to set and maintain norms, and if the leader of America is open in using racism to advance   policy, his party at the least should feel emboldened. Maybe Trump just isn’t a deft enough politician to grasp the importance of maintaining the cloak of colorblindness in his calls for voter integrity. But the deeper implication is that such a cloak may no longer matter. After winning an election steeped in some rather overt appeals to racism and hatred of immigrants, why should the new president feel inclined to blunt his language? Underlying all the bemoaning of political correctness in his rhetoric is the Rosetta Stone of Trumpism: that Trump wants to be able to say the thing again. And with that comes a whole new world of possibilities for voter suppression.": "73767",

    "AFTER HIS latest execrable tweets, it’s obvious that there is no point in urging President Trump to act with greater dignity, respect for his office or, for that matter,  . It isn’t going to happen. That makes it all the more urgent for the rest of us to think about how to safeguard civility and democratic values until his presidency ends. It would be wrong to say that Mr. Trump’s attacks on Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough Thursday were shocking, because his boorishness no longer can shock. But the hateful insults directed at the MSNBC   (and, in Mr. Scarborough’s case, Post columnist) did seem to take the capital city’s collective breath away. “Please just stop,” Republican Sen. Ben Sasse (Neb.) tweeted in response. “This isn’t normal and it’s beneath the dignity of your office. ” Many others chimed in, urging Mr. Trump to apologize, to stop tweeting or even (in a moment of extreme wishful thinking) to resign. Yes, Mr. Trump should apologize, he should stop tweeting insults, he should respect the awesome history of his office. Similarly, he should stop attacking the news media, which plays an important role in American democracy. He should take questions from the press more often, and he should answer truthfully. He should show more respect for women. He should, in short, act presidential, and he should continue to be urged to do so, not only by editorial pages but also by other leaders, especially in his own party, and by people in his administration. But assuming he remains immune to such importuning, what can the rest of us do? We’ve given this some thought in the context of international relations, because the world had become accustomed to looking to the United States as a defender of democracy, human rights and liberal values. Admittedly the nation has played this role imperfectly, with dollops of hypocrisy and inconsistency along the way. But from World War II until now, the United States had not been led by anyone espousing selfishness as a lodestar. And that has made it crucial for others to fill the gap  —   crucial for Congress, civil society and citizens across the nation to stand up for freedom and for the United States remaining a beacon of freedom across the globe. We’d say the same now about plain old courtesy and decorum. It may be beyond the power of any other politician to change Mr. Trump’s behavior. But all of us can model a different way of acting and interacting.       (Peter   Washington Post)   What gives us hope is the conviction that the American people are better than the misogyny and rudeness we see spewing from the White House. Our politics have always been rough and tumble, but most of us don’t want to see this kind of ugliness become the dominant trait. We should all be focused on preserving a little flame of decency so that, whenever the Trump era ends, that flame can be rekindled into the kind of discourse that would make the country proud again.

    "Madelyn Rubinstein moved to New York City from Long Island in 1985 with big dreams of making it as a professional pianist. She had a head start: a very cheap   apartment, recently vacated by her grandmother, on Central Park South. When Ms. Rubinstein took possession of it, her rent was $93. 08 a month  —   the same price that her grandmother had been paying since 1967. Several months later, Ms. Rubinstein came home one evening to find an eviction notice on her door. The building’s new owner, Donald J. Trump, wanted her out. Mr. Trump’s plan was to knock down the building and the one next door, which he also owned, and replace them with a luxury   condominium complex facing Central Park. What he got instead was a New York brawl with a group of tenants fighting to save their homes and clinging with white knuckles to some of the city’s legendary rent deals. The battle played out for years in courtrooms and the New York news media, becoming a kind of parable of the limits of 1980s capitalist ambition in the social democratic city. Looking back on the fight, on the eve of Tuesday’s New York Republican primary, one can see Mr. Trump waging a much different sort of campaign, but with many of the same tactics  —   the threats, the theatrics, the penchant for hyperbole  —   that he has deployed in his quest for the Republican presidential nomination. As far as the tenants are concerned, Mr. Trump lost that contest. “Oh, absolutely, we won,” said Ms. Rubinstein, sitting in the   apartment where she still lives. “He wanted this whole corner to be one big Trump building. ” But Mr. Trump refuses to admit defeat. “A great deal,” he said, without hesitation, when describing 100 Central Park South  —   now known as Trump Parc East  —   during a phone interview last week. “It was a long battle, but it was a successful battle. As usual, I came out on top. ” Mr. Trump paid just $13 million for 100 Central Park South and the building adjoining it, the Barbizon Plaza Hotel, in 1981. At the time, he was 35 and making bold strides to emerge from his father’s shadow. In recent years, he had built the   Trump Tower and overhauled the building near Grand Central Terminal that became the Grand Hyatt New York. This would be a no less audacious project, and on one of the city’s most desirable blocks. To realize his dream, he had to first clear out the residents of the building, a   tower with 80 apartments, some overlooking Central Park, nearly all inhabited by tenants paying well below market rates.   and   apartments occupy a kind of mythic place in New York City history. Rent protections were created to guard families from the whims of landlords and the market they still cover about one million apartments in the city. State laws limit their rent increases and guarantee tenants, and often their children and grandchildren, the right to stay. But in expensive neighborhoods, the deals can become skewed. At 100 Central Park South, for instance, there were   apartments overlooking the park with rents as low as $436 per month. Mr. Trump wanted all of the tenants out. But rather than buying them out, a common tactic, he and the management company he hired tried to get the job done free. So the battle  —   captured in numerous lawsuits, court documents and news media accounts from that time  —   began. Leaks went unfixed, tenants alleged, and broken appliances went unrepaired. Aluminum foil was placed over windows in empty apartments, giving the building a   appearance. (Mr. Trump defended the action as standard procedure for vacant units.) More dramatic were the eviction notices from Mr. Trump’s lawyers, on a variety of grounds. One tenant was told that he had not paid his rent on time. (He presented a canceled check in court to prove that he had.) Others who had done construction on their apartments, with the approval of prior landlords, were told that they had 10 days to restore them to their original conditions. Suzanne Blackmer, a   actress and one of the original Rockettes, was ordered to vacate her   unit, for which she paid $203. 59 a month, because it was not her primary residence, meaning she was not entitled to rent protections. Ms. Blackmer insisted that it was after a legal battle that lasted more than a decade, she prevailed. Mr. Trump made his opponents out to be millionaire plutocrats, “people of great wealth. ” And also whiners. “Let me tell you something about the rich,” he said in one interview in the midst of the battle. “They have a very low threshold for pain. ” Recounting the story later in his memoir “The Art of the Deal,” Mr. Trump acknowledged that he had deliberately tried to drive out tenants, but he said that most of them were exploiting an undeserved government subsidy. He recalled getting rid of a free telephone in the building’s lobby that he claimed tenants were using “to call their friends in Gstaad and St. Moritz. ” Ms. Rubinstein and two other residents from the time said they remembered only a pay phone in the building. And while its roll of renters included a successful fashion designer and an architect, it also included a number of older people living on fixed incomes. As Mr. Trump’s frustration with the tenants grew, he offered the building’s dozen or so empty units as shelters for the homeless, promising free apartments with “beautiful views. ” The city declined, questioning the wisdom of moving people into a building headed for demolition. “I actually thought it was a very generous offer,” Mr. Trump said last week. “I don’t want to see people out on the streets. ” The tenants eventually hired a lawyer, David Rozenholc, to represent them. Now a familiar nemesis to New York City developers  —   last year, he negotiated a $25 million total payout for three clients whom Tishman Speyer was trying to eject from a small apartment building in Hudson Yards  —   Mr. Rozenholc took advantage of a legal flaw in Mr. Trump’s plans to block his application to begin construction. He also sued Mr. Trump, accusing him of harassing Mr. Rozenholc’s clients. The lawsuit claimed, among other things, that the building’s superintendent had been instructed by the management to spy on tenants. Mr. Trump brought his own action against Mr. Rozenholc, a federal racketeering suit that sought $105 million in damages and found its way to The New York Post before it was filed. Mr. Rozenholc said the suit, which was dismissed, was entirely frivolous. But he offered some words for Mr. Trump that were relatively kind, given the men’s contentious history. “He knows how to negotiate, he knows how to use leverage and he’s very perceptive about his opponent’s vulnerabilities,” Mr. Rozenholc said. “It didn’t work against me, but when you deal with Putin and Iran, these could be useful qualities. ” The tenants were waging their own campaign in the news media, casting Mr. Trump as a slumlord and a bully. In 1986, after five years of fighting, Mr. Trump abandoned his plans to knock down the building. The tenants could stay in their apartments, paying their existing rents. Mr. Trump would never realize his vision for the project. But in a sense, his defeat had been a victory, as he claimed. Even as the tenants were refusing to budge, preventing any demolition or construction, the value of the property was soaring along with the rest of New York City’s real estate market in the 1980s. In the late 1990s, Mr. Trump finally converted the building into condominiums, but renters were allowed to remain. Today, some continue to rent   units for under $1, 000 a month, less than a third of what similar apartments cost. Ms. Rubinstein, who was guaranteed   rent for life, chose instead to buy at a steep discount, paying just $150, 000 for an apartment that is now worth at least $700, 000. She is also a member of the condo board, along with one of her more noteworthy neighbors, who lives on the building’s 13th floor: Mr. Trump’s son Eric.": "23098",
    "Uber Technologies Inc Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick quit President Donald Trump’s business advisory group on Thursday amid mounting pressure from activists and employees who oppose the administration’s immigration policies. Critics included Uber drivers, many of whom are immigrants themselves. ”Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that,” Kalanick, who had planned to attend a meeting of the group on Friday, said in an email to staff that was seen by Reuters. Uber spokeswoman Chelsea Kohler later confirmed that he had left the group. Social media campaigns had targeted Uber, urging users to delete accounts and opt for rival Lyft Inc. Uber has been emailing users who deleted their accounts to say it shares their concerns and will compensate drivers affected by the ban.  Kalanick said he spoke briefly to Trump about the immigration order ”and its issues for our community” and told the president he would not join the economic council. The CEO came under increasing pressure to leave the council after Trump issued an executive order temporarily barring people from seven   nations from entering the United States. ”There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that. The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America,” he wrote in a note to employees. ”Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there’s a growing fear the U. S. is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants.” The White House said in a statement Thursday evening that did not mention Uber that Trump ”understands the importance of an open dialogue with fellow business leaders to discuss how to best make our nation’s economy stronger.” The move could put pressure on other CEOs expected to attend a meeting with Trump on Friday. General Motors Co said its chief executive would attend, while Walt Disney Co said earlier Thursday its chief executive would not attend because of a   board meeting. Others expected to take part include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Blackstone Group LP, IBM Corp and   Stores Inc. Others that are part of the council include Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk, PepsiCo Inc CEO Indra Nooyi and Boston Consulting Group CEO Rich Lesser. Musk said he would attend the meeting. ”In tomorrow’s meeting, I and others will express our objections to the recent executive order on immigration and offer suggestions for changes to the policy,” he said in a tweet on Thursday. Kalanick’s departure could signal a growing rift between technology companies and Washington.  ”There is a battle brewing between Trump and Silicon Valley,” said Neeraj Agrawal, general partner at Battery Ventures. ”They (the Trump administration) clearly don’t value the economic activity generated by tech.” Microsoft Corp on Thursday said it proposed a modification of Trump’s travel limits. Technology companies including Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Amazon. com Inc have opposed Trump’s order, arguing that they rely on workers from around the world.

    "To some degree, I felt immense pride and joy as the president of the United States entered Cuba today, becoming the first to do so in 88 years. However, as I watched the live television feed from Havana, all joy was replaced with sadness. You would have thought, that for such a historic and significant event, the Cuban people would have been informed about the visit, and the various stops that President Obama was scheduled to make. All of that information was limited to the people, and most of them were not aware of timing or scheduling of today’s events. In other words, the Cuban people were not given the chance to express their gratitude to the American president by making themselves visible to welcome the American delegation to Cuba. They were never given the chance. You would have imagined that with the historical landing of the president’s motorcade, the streets of Havana would have been lined with hope. Instead, the live television feed of the motorcade was not shown on the island. The people instead watched a taped, delayed version. In another troubling turn of events, just hours before Obama arrived the civil rights group Ladies in White tried to stage a   protest on Palm Sunday, but they were arrested by Cuban security forces. These women represent the sons and daughters of Cuba that have been thrown in jail over their attempt to express the desire for basic human rights. And so, as I listened to the Cuban analyst talk about what the president’s visit may represent for human rights in Cuba, all that I could think about what the Cuban government itself wants, which is to stay exactly the way that it is. I do not believe that Obama has a true understanding of how unwilling the Cuban government is to change. If Obama believed that he was going to be able to preach about civil rights and open doors for the Cuban people during this visit, he is sorely mistaken. His message to Cuba’s government will fall on deaf ears. Let me remind you that the reason we broke diplomatic relations with Cuba in the first place was because of their totalitarian communist regime and what it implied for the developing island. At the time, our leaders believed that it was the only way to keep Fidel Castro in check. Now, I do agree with Obama that the strategy did not work, and as a result Cuba became more isolated and the people suffered tremendously. I believe that the Cuban government wants to form a   regime. They want open commerce but they don’t want any governmental change when it comes to the people. It is now up to Obama to prevent that from happening just 90 miles away from the U. S. coast. In doing so, he must approach this newfound relationship that we have with them as one of compromise, and not one made of victories and defeats. So while I am skeptical of what Obama’s visit to Cuba will mean for the people, I am in a way still hopeful that it marks the beginning of a very long process toward freedom for them. It will be a long time before they are able to exercise their own rights, but let us hope that this is the beginning of a path that leads to their democratic voice, their human rights, and their ability to become a self sustaining nation, which is what every Cuban wants.": "83603",

    "The state of Arkansas plans to put to death eight inmates over a span of 10 days next month, a pace of executions unequaled in recent American history and brought about by a looming expiration date for a drug used by the state for lethal injections. The eight men facing execution  —   four black and four white  —   are among 34 death row inmates in Arkansas, where capital punishment has been suspended since 2005 over legal challenges and difficulty in acquiring the drugs for lethal injections. All eight men were convicted of murders that occurred between 1989 and 1999, and proponents of the death penalty and victims’ rights in the state have been frustrated that the cases have dragged on so long. At a news conference this week, Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican and former federal prosecutor, seemed to regret that the executions were so closely stacked. “I would love to have those extended over a period of multiple months and years, but that’s not the circumstances that I find myself in,” said Mr. Hutchinson, who took office in 2015. “And, again, the families of the victims that have endured this for so many years deserve a conclusion to it. ” In a statement on Friday, Mr. Hutchinson said that it was necessary to schedule the executions close together because of doubts about the future availability of one of three drugs the state uses in its   procedure. State officials have previously said that the expiration date would pass in April for Arkansas’s supply of midazolam, a drug that has been used in several botched and gruesome lethal injections in other states in recent years. Amid the controversy generated by such cases, a number of pharmaceutical companies have restricted their drugs from use for capital punishment. Some states have had difficultly finding midazolam. Arizona announced last year it would stop using it in part because of the logistical challenges. “It is uncertain as to whether another drug can be obtained,” Mr. Hutchinson said in the statement, “and the families of the victims do not need to live with continued uncertainty after decades of review. ” This week, the governor signed proclamations setting four execution dates for the eight inmates between April 17 and 27. Two men would be put to death on each of the four dates. If Arkansas follows that timetable, it will be at a rate unmatched by any state since the United States resumed the death penalty in 1977, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit research group that opposes capital punishment. In 1997, Texas came close, putting eight inmates to death in May and again in June, but not over such a short number of days, the group said. Critics of midazolam’s use in executions say it is a sedative, not an anesthetic, and is thus misapplied as a first round of lethal injection shots, with inmates sometimes able to feel pain from the subsequent lethal drugs that are administered. In one   case in Oklahoma, a convict named Clayton D. Lockett, who was administered midazolam, died 43 minutes after the injections were started and appeared to struggle and moan. The Arkansas Department of Correction has not refilled its stock of potassium chloride, the third and fatal drug administered in an execution, but a spokesman for Mr. Hutchinson said the governor had confidence the department would acquire it in time for the April executions. Brian Stull, a senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, argued that something was more likely to go wrong with so many executions scheduled so close together. “Each of these prisoners is a person with rights that have to be honored, and each execution is a process that needs to be planned and handled with care and close attention to detail,” he said. “And that’s just impossible for Arkansas on this schedule. Because they’re trying to do too much, too quickly, with too little preparation. It’s likely to lead to botched executions. ” The lawyers for the condemned men say some legal avenues of appeal are still available. Their lengthy appeal process has included a petition asking the United States Supreme Court to review the matter. The court denied the petition on Feb. 21. But the men’s lawyers said that even a   scenario would most likely only entail an alternative form of execution to the current   injection method, which the lawyers argue is unconstitutionally cruel. “The state’s supply of midazolam runs out on April 30,” said John Williams, an assistant federal public defender based in Little Rock. “And so the schedule is quite obviously dictated by that, and we think it is inhumane that the state would schedule executions so as to get rid of a drug supply that the evidence shows is cruel and unusual. ” The executions come at an unsettled and complicated moment for capital punishment in the United States. Nationwide, the number of executions has been in steep decline, and though many Americans support the death penalty, some polling shows that support for capital punishment has been steadily waning since the  . And while the Supreme Court has been less than clear on its collective stance toward capital punishment, President Trump is an ardent and longtime proponent. The president’s opinions may have little direct effect on state cases, but his blunt,    speech is sure to influence the tone of the national conversation. In Arkansas, Mr. Hutchinson has earned a reputation as a relative moderate, serving in some cases as a break on the   ambitions of the   legislature. But he has also been determined to reactivate the death penalty. The year he took office, he scheduled the execution of eight inmates, including several of the same men set to die next month, saying that they had exhausted all appeals. But a state court halted the executions because of a lawsuit against the state over its provisions at the time that kept secret the sources of its lethal injection drugs. The state was then ordered to disclose information about its supply chain. Mr. Hutchinson’s latest effort to restart executions came after the state’s attorney general, Leslie Rutledge, told him that the eight men had no additional legal challenges to their executions. The eight men scheduled for execution are Kenneth Williams, Bruce Ward, Stacey Johnson, Don Williamson Davis, Ledell Lee, Jack Harold Jones, Jason McGehee and Marcel Williams. Some of the crimes were particularly heinous. Mr. Ward went into a Jackpot convenience store in Little Rock on a night in August 1989 and asked the clerk, Rebecca Lynn Doss, an    who read the Bible during the overnight shift by herself, for help unlocking the men’s restroom. Inside the bathroom, he sexually assaulted and strangled her. A police officer spotted him leaving the restroom and about to get on his motorcycle to leave. Mr. Lee killed Debra Reese, 26, in her home in February 1993 in Jacksonville, Ark. outside Little Rock, after beating her 36 times with a tire tool that her husband had given her for protection while he was out of town. Kenneth Williams killed a cheerleader at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff in December 1998 but escaped from a   prison after a jury sentenced him to life the next year. A few miles from the prison, he fatally shot Cecil Boren, a farmer who was working in the yard while his wife was at church, and stole his truck. Mr. Williams led the police into Missouri in a   chase before he crashed into a car, killing the driver. In 2005, he confessed to killing a    man the same day he shot the cheerleader. At the news conference, Mr. Hutchinson said he had discussed concerns about stacking the executions, and its potential ill effects on prison employees, with Wendy Kelley, the state corrections director. “The answer is it’s not any easier to string it over four or five months than to do it in a measured and separated fashion, but in the sequence we have outlined,” he said.": "18981",

    "Furnace Creek, California (CNN) It felt like pins, burning hot pins, pricking her arms, her legs, the back of her neck. Jenny Cary is standing outside the   Furnace Creek Visitor Center at Death Valley National Park and the oppressive   heat was doing a number on her.  ”My legs are burning!” she exclaims. But she stays put.  Cary is from Green Bay, Wisconsin, and she drove here with her family from Las Vegas after hearing about the record heat that has already broken three records this week. She says she wanted to experience it  .  ”I’ve now felt 127 degrees down to 40 below,” says Cary’s husband, Mike. The scorching heat baking the West has caused massive power outages and prompted flight cancellations.  But for weather warriors like the Carys, the extreme temperature makes for a trip worth taking.  On the day they’re here, the official temperature here is 127 degrees Fahrenheit.  But what matters most is a digital thermostat outside the visitor center. Perched directly in the sun, its scorching temperatures make for selfies that burn up social media. That is, if you can make your phone work.  Less than 10 minutes out in the sun, and your iPhone  shuts down with an urgent warning: iPhone needs to cool down before you can use it. ”I’ve wanted to get a picture at 130 degrees, and today I got it,” says Joe Harrington of Aurora, Illinois, who made the impromptu drive from Las Vegas (the official reading is taken in the shade). While a visit this week does make for a story, the park warns extreme heat can be deadly without the proper preparation and precautions.  A few degrees from   high, The heat wave ushering in summer on Wednesday may be breaking daily records here, but it’s not forecast to break the   record of 134 degrees recorded in Death Valley in 1913. Park officials say that measurement is increasingly being scrutinized by scientists, but it still holds against the next hottest temperature of 129. ”I’ll probably never feel this hot again in my life,” says De’mond Singleton. And he knows hot. As he stands in direct sunlight next to the thermometer reading 130 degrees, Singleton compares it to his experience serving with the US Army in Iraq and Afghanistan. ”This is on another level here, this will kill you,” says Singleton, who drove from Lancaster, California. ”I haven’t felt the monster of all heat until coming here.” Like most people, Singleton is experiencing the heat and then getting out. But Randy Humiston isn’t like most people    he’s sleeping in it. The lone camper, There are 136 campsites at the Furnace Creek Campground, but on this scorching hot night (the overnight low is 91 degrees) there is only one spot filled. The camper filling it belongs to Humiston, an amateur geologist who splits his time between California and Hawaii. ”I never had this much space in Death Valley before,” Humiston said. ”I don’t feel intimidated about walking out in my underwear.” Why is he here? Humiston is on the maiden voyage in a camper he bought last year, and Death Valley is his ”favorite place in the world.” ”I figured why not test it in the extreme conditions and find out how she’s doing,” he said. ”And she’s doing quite well.” Park rangers reported a temperature of 110 degrees at midnight the previous night, but Humiston said his AC got it ”down into the 80s.” ”I had to pull the sleeping bag over me at one point,” he says with a defiant chuckle. Still, rangers are discouraging camping during this heat wave. ’Normally hot’ is the most dangerous time, Surprisingly, officials say most   problems occur in ”normally hot” temperatures between 105 and 115 degrees. ”When it’s this ridiculously hot people get out of their car and go ’Absolutely not,’” says park ranger Abby Wines. Last year, two people died in ”average” heat, including a motorcyclist whose GoPro video showed him pull over to the side of the road, become wobbly and then collapse. Aside from drinking plenty of water (a couple of gallons, Wines says) rangers recommend light meals over large ones, which may be tough for the body to handle in a foreign climate. ”It’s like going to a higher elevation for the first time, when you get short of breath,” Wines says. ”The same kind of thing can happen in high heat as well.” And this place is all about high heat. The National Park Service said the area in 1996 had 40 days higher than 120 degrees F (49 degrees C). In 2013, a     tutorial video posted by the park sparked an   frenzy that left park officials cleaning up the mess. Death Valley got its name in 1849 when prospectors heading to the gold fields got lost and stumbled into the harsh desert. International intrigue, Despite the rush of ”thrill seekers” wanting impressive selfies, Death Valley at this time of year is largely an international affair. ”I hope my shoes don’t start melting,” says Stefan Van Groningen of the Netherlands. He and his friends are on holiday, and couldn’t wait to experience both rugged terrain and temperatures they can’t get back home. By July, the park expects 70% of its visitors to be   its brochures are printed in four languages. Wines says locals can get heat by staying home, but that this is unusual for tourists. ”This is very special. It’s so hot and the landscape,” says Francesca, a tourist from Switzerland admiring the park with three friends. For Van Groningen, one of the most dramatic parts of his American journey has been conquering Death Valley’s tempting heat. ”So we can take it in the luggage with us.”": "55202",
    "A    Phoenix boy with deadly osteosarcoma is forced to move to London with his family to get access to a   medicine  —   a drug that was developed by doctors at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas, received a prestigious award in the United Kingdom, and was determined to be safe and effective by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) but is not approved for use here in America. A    Vietnam veteran with neuroendocrine carcinoid cancer is forced to spend his retirement savings to get a cancer treatment in Germany that has been standard care in Europe since 1996, but was unavailable in the United States. \tEvery year, Americans are forced to go abroad to get drugs or treatments that have been deemed safe and effective in Europe and advanced   countries with the most scientifically rigorous approval processes in the world. Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who is appearing on Capitol Hill this week for his confirmation hearings to be the next commissioner of the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should be asked what the Trump administration plans to do for these Americans  —   and how it plans to help those who are too sick (or simply cannot afford) to travel abroad for treatments that should be available to them right here at home. \tThe RESULT Act could have saved the life of Emily Stillman, a Kalamazoo College student who contracted meningitis B in a 2103 campus outbreak that also affected students at Georgetown, Princeton, San Diego State, Drexel, and University of California —  Santa Barbara. A vaccine for meningitis B called Bexsero had been approved in the European Union, Australia, and Canada, but was not available in the United States, so university administrators had to apply to the FDA for special permission to import it and administer it to their students. That took nine months  —   too long for Emily, who died before the vaccine arrived. Amazingly, it took the FDA almost two more years after Emily’s death to finally approve Bexsero for general use in the United States. If there had been reciprocity between the EMA and the FDA, there would have been no need for American college students facing a deadly outbreak of meningitis B to wait to get the   vaccine. \tOr take idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) a fatal lung disease for which there was no effective treatment, until a drug company named InterMune developed a breakthrough therapy called pirfenidone that reduces scarring in the lungs and thus extends life. In March 2010, an FDA advisory panel recommended approval of pirfenidone, but the FDA said no and demanded additional data. The FDA did not finally approve the drug until October 15, 2014  —   two years after Health Canada, three years and eight months after the EMA, and four years and seven months after its own advisory committee voted overwhelmingly to approve it. About 40, 000 Americans die each year of IPF. That means an estimated 183, 000 Americans lost their lives while the FDA was dithering, withholding the only known treatment for this disease. \tReciprocity will give a voice  —   and a chance  —   to the countless Americans who are dying silently each year while promising treatments are bottled up at the FDA. Doctors without Borders is famous for saving patients regardless of where they live. Medical advances, too, should be freed from false borders. If a treatment cures breast cancer in Sweden, it will cure the same cancer in Florida. Reciprocity will bring those treatments to U. S. shores faster  —   and that will save American lives.,": "116015",
    "(CNN) The two young women are seen in Islamic garb with only their faces showing. They appear to be seated against a wall. One reads a brief statement in English, which includes: ”We are in big danger and we could be killed.” The statement identifies them as Greta Ramelli and Vanessa Marzullo. Two young Italian women by those names    ages 20 and 21    went missing and were believed kidnapped after they traveled to Syria in late July. ”I have no doubt that it’s them,” Vanessa’s father Salvatore Marzullo told CNN of the video posted online Thursday.  Some postings say the video is from al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat  . One of the young women holds a paper suggesting that the video was shot December 17.  ”We supplicate our government and its mediators to bring us back home before Christmas. We are in big danger and we could be killed. The government and its mediators are responsible of our lives,” the other says, reading the statement. Italian intelligence sources consider the video to be authentic, according to the   ANSA news agency. ”These women are shouting for help, they are sending out an SOS,” said Laura Boldrini, speaker of the Italian Chamber of Deputies. She added, ”We do not know how reliable this video is, but the situation of these two women is distressing.”  The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to comment on the video.

    "For all the criticism of Golden State’s Draymond Green and his penchant for committing flagrant fouls during these playoffs, Wednesday may have brought the harshest words yet. The critic: Green himself. Saying he let the Warriors down and that he was a “terrible ” Green spoke on how it pained him to be suspended for Game 5 of the NBA finals  —   and how he will make amends on Thursday night in Game 6, when the Warriors visit the Cleveland Cavaliers and get another shot at winning what would be their second straight championship. “I owe to my   to come back and give all that I have, all that I can do to better this situation,” Green said. “I have strong belief that if I play Game 5, we win. But I didn’t because I put myself in a situation where I wasn’t able to play. ” He added: “The way I view it, [I was an] awful, terrible   and I take pride at being better. ” Golden State lead the series   but now knows they will play the rest of the series without starting center Andrew Bogut because of a left knee injury. Green  —   who missed Game 5 because of how many flagrants he has accrued during the playoffs  —   will be called upon to play some center in Game 6, as he has plenty of times in this postseason already. “Draymond is the spirit of what we do,” said Warriors guard Stephen Curry, the NBA’s   reigning MVP. “You see it out on the floor. ” This series is back in Cleveland largely because LeBron James and Kyrie Irving could not be stopped in Game 5, when the Warriors’ best defender was watching the Cavaliers’ star duo score 41 points apiece from a suite at the adjacent baseball stadium that the Oakland Athletics call home. Green alone could not have stopped their onslaught, but it surely stands to reason that life would have been more difficult for Cleveland if he was in uniform. Without Green, the Warriors lost by 15. He’s already spoken to his   about his mistakes, and made clear that watching Game 5 from next door left him hurting. “Everybody’s helped with Draymond being on the floor,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “So that will be nice to have him back. We missed him the other night. We were disappointed in our performance without him. We thought we could still get it done, but we didn’t. So now it’s time to recharge the batteries and get ready. ” The straw that got Green suspended was when he took a swipe at James’ groin area in Game 4. But when asked what he expected when he sees Green in Game 6, James showed he’s only focused on bigger pictures and no    battle. “My only job is to get this win, man,” James said. Green met with reporters before practice, and didn’t shy away from his mistakes in these playoffs. Some thought he merited a suspension when he kicked Oklahoma City’s Steven Adams in the groin area during the Western Conference finals. The NBA upgraded the foul and fined him after reviewing that play, and when another flagrant was assessed    for taking the shot at James a suspension was automatic. “I move on from the suspension. We move on. It was Game 5. We’re here in Game 6,” Green said. “So it’s behind us. We’ve got an opportunity to do something that, I don’t know if it’s ever been done . .. where you win a championship on someone else’s floor two years in a row. ” Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue was asked if his team might try to prod Green a bit, knowing another flagrant foul or two technicals in Game 6 would mean another suspension for Game 7. “You just play the game,” Lue said. Green, who acknowledged that he’s been working on keeping emotions in check, didn’t sound worried. “I think I’ve got to come out and play my game regardless,” Green said. “But there are those little fine lines where you just know you can’t cross them. ” If Cleveland win, Game 7 is in Oakland on Sunday. If Cleveland lose, the Warriors will celebrate on the Cavs’ home floor for the second consecutive year  —   exactly one year to the day from last year’s clincher. And if Golden State get to spray champagne the cramped visiting locker room at Quicken Loans Arena around again, those bubbles will likely wash away most of not all the sting Green is feeling for letting his team down. “Nobody will remember this down the road if we get this done tomorrow night,” Curry said. “So that’s really all we need to talk about. ”": "158275",
    "(CNN) Meryl Streep was honored at the Golden Globes for a lifetime of notable work, and she took the opportunity to make a sustained attack on US   Donald Trump. In a nearly   address while accepting the Cecil B. DeMille Award, the actress denounced Trump’s campaign rhetoric and criticized him for mocking a disabled reporter. Related: Trump attacks Streep for speech at Golden Globes, As the audience of Hollywood stars and executives sat in silence, Streep said: ”There was one performance this year that stunned me. It sank its hooks in my heart. Not because it was good, there was nothing good about it, but it was effective and it did its job. ”It was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter. Someone he outranked in privilege, power and the capacity to fight back.” Streep’s comments were a reference to a rally by Trump in November 2015 when he imitated New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, who has a condition that affects his joint movements. Trump has always denied he was mocking the reporter. In an interview with the The New York Times Monday morning, Trump said he was ”not surprised” by the criticism from ”liberal movie people,” pointing out that Streep was a supporter of his defeated rival, Hillary Clinton. Streep used her speech to highlight the importance to American culture of outsiders and foreigners, whom she said were among the ”most vilified segments in American society right now.   ”Hollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners and if we kick them all out, you’ll have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts, which are not the arts,” Streep said to huge applause from the room. RELATED: Golden Globes 2017: ’La La Land’ breaks record, Streep said Trump’s attack on the New York Times reporter legitimized bullying.  ”It kind of broke my heart when I saw it and I still can’t get it out of my head because it wasn’t in a movie, it was real life,” Streep said. ”This instinct to humiliate when it’s modeled by someone in the public . .. by someone powerful, it filters down into everyone’s life because it kind of gives permission for other people to do the same.” Streep added: ”When the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose.” She called on the press to ”hold power to account, to call him on the carpet for every outrage”    another apparent reference to Trump.  Streep asked audience members to support the nonprofit Committee to Protect Journalists ”because we’re going to need them going forward and they’re going to need us to safeguard the truth.” The Golden Globes are awarded by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. Trump: Streep is a ’Hillary lover’ Responding to Streep’s speech, Trump again denied mocking Kovaleski. ”I was never mocking anyone,” Trump told the New York Times. ”People keep saying I that I intended to mock the reporter’s disability, as if Meryl Streep and others could read my mind, and I did no such thing.” Trump, who had not seen the speech, called Streep ”a Hillary lover,” according to the Times.  At the Globes and online, Streep received support from her peers.  Audience members listened with rapt attention. Actress Kerry Washington appeared near tears in the audience when the camera cut to her. On Twitter, the actress Julianne Moore wrote: ”Thank you #MerylStreep.” ”Everything she said. Thank you #MerylStreep for you work and everything you said tonight,” added Laverne Cox. The response to Streep’s speech wasn’t all positive.  Fox News host Sean Hannity tweeted: ”This is exactly why Hwood is DYING, what a bunch of hypocrites. Sex, violence, and drivel rule hwood. Turning the channel.” Radio host Meghan McCain, daughter of Republican Senator John McCain, added: ”This Meryl Streep speech is why Trump won. And if people in Hollywood don’t start recognizing why and how   you will help him get  .” Streep also drew some criticism from the Mixed Martial Arts community.  In a letter posted to Twitter, Scott Coker, an MMA promoter and fighter, invited Streep to an upcoming event in Los Angeles so she can see ”that Mixed Martial Arts is truly artistic.”  Streep closed her speech with a quote from her late friend Carrie Fisher: ”Take your broken heart, make it into art.”": "50584",
    "For Jules Verne it was the friend who keeps us waiting. For Edgar Allan Poe so many little slices of death. But though the reason we spend a third of our lives asleep has so far resisted scientific explanation, research into the impact of sleepless nights on brain function has shed fresh light on the mystery   and also offered intriguing clues to potential treatments for depression. In a study published on Tuesday, researchers show for the first time that sleep resets the steady   of connectivity in the human brain which takes place in our waking hours. The process appears to be crucial for our brains to remember and learn so we can adapt to the world around us. The loss of a single night’s sleep was enough to block the brain’s natural reset mechanism, the scientists found. Deprived of rest, the brain’s neurons seemingly became   and so muddled with electrical activity that new memories could not be properly laid down. But Christoph Nissen, a psychiatrist who led the study at the University of Freiburg, is also excited about the potential for helping people with mental health disorders. One radical treatment for major depression is therapeutic sleep deprivation, which Nissen believes works through changing the patient’s brain connectivity. The new research offers a deeper understanding of the phenomenon which could be adapted to produce more practical treatments. “Why we sleep is a fundamental question. Why do we spend so much of our lives in this brain state? This work shows us that sleep is a highly active brain process and not a waste of time. It’s required for healthy brain function,” said Nissen. The results are a boost for what is called the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis of sleep, which was developed by scientists at the University of   in 2003. It explains why our brains need to rest after a day spent absorbing all manner of information, from the morning news and the state of the weather, to a chat over lunch and what we must buy for tea. Known more simply as SHY, the hypothesis states that when we are awake, the synapses that form connections between our brain cells strengthen more and more as we learn and eventually saturate our brains with information. The process requires a lot of energy, but sleep allows the brain to wind down its activity, consolidate our memories, and be ready to start again the next morning. Writing in the journal Nature Communications, Nissen describes a series of tests that 11 men and nine women aged 19 to 25 took part in, either after a good night’s sleep, or after a night without sleep. On the sleepless night, participants played games, went for walks and cooked food, but were not allowed caffeine. Staff watched them throughout to make sure they stayed awake. In the first round of experiments, Nissen used magnetic pulses to make neurons fire in the volunteers’ brains and cause a muscle in the left hand to twitch. When sleep deprived, far weaker pulses were sufficient to make the muscles move. This implied that sleepless brains are in a more excitable state, with their neurons more strongly connected than they are after a good night’s sleep. Nissen next turned to another form of brain stimulation to mimic the way neurons fire when memories are laid down. He found it harder to get the neurons to respond in   people, a sign that the process of writing memories was impaired by sleep loss. Taken together, the results suggest that sleep allows the brain to calm its activity so memories can be written down. In contrast, the   brain becomes noisy with electrical activity and so feeble at laying down memories that the process is all but blocked. The consequences of sleep loss were clear in a simple memory test, with tired volunteers faring worse than those who were  . Teasing out how sleep affects brain connections could do more than answer why we snooze so much. Shift workers and military personnel that have to cope with sleep deprivation could benefit from new drugs or countermeasures that restore normal brain connectivity. Blood samples taken from volunteers in the study showed that sleep deprivation lowered levels of a molecule called BDNF, or   neurotrophic factor, which regulates synaptic connections in the brain. But Nissen is more excited about the study’s implications for understanding therapeutic sleep deprivation and its impact on depression. “If you deprive people with major depression of sleep for one night, about 60% show a substantial improvement in mood, motivation and cognitive function. We think it works by shifting these patients into a more favourable state,” he said. Though striking when it works, therapeutic sleep deprivation is not much use because many patients relapse after the subsequent night’s sleep. But that is not the point, Nissen says. “It proves that it’s possible to shift a person’s mood from one state to another within hours. The idea is that we use sleep and sleep deprivation to understand the brain and develop new treatments. If you think about antidepressants or psychotherapy, it can take weeks or months to see any effects. ”  Giulio Tononi, a professor of sleep medicine who first proposed SHY at the University of   said the new study was “truly elegant and powerful” and confirmed experiments that until now had only been performed in animals. “Sleep is essential, and one main reason is that it allows the brain to learn new things every day while preserving and consolidating the old memories,” Tononi said. “Learning and memory require synaptic activity, which is very energetically expensive and prone to saturation. Sleep allows the brain to renormalize this synaptic activity after it increases in the waking day. ” Lars Westlye, a psychologist at University of Oslo, called the study “wonderful” and said the results could throw light on links between the biology of sleep, more complex brain functions, and severe mental disorders such as schizophrenia and depression. Like Nissen he believes that a clearer understanding of brain connectivity might explain why sleep deprivation can be so effective in people with depression, and plans to study the effect in patients. “These new results should strongly motivate further studies in patient groups, both to learn more about the roots of the disorders and how to treat them,” Westlye said.": "156580",

    "PHILADELPHIA  —   Forty times, city or state governments had proposed taxes on sugary soft drinks, failing each time. Then, in 2014, liberal Berkeley, Calif. passed such a tax, but most people saw it as an aberration. Several measures, including one in New York, never won much support. But on Thursday, a measure to tax sweetened drinks passed in Philadelphia, one of the country’s largest cities  —   and also one of its poorest. Indeed, raising revenue was the winning argument in Philadelphia. Jim Kenney, the mayor, took a different tack from that of politicians who have tried and failed to pass   taxes. He didn’t talk about the tax as a   measure designed to discourage   soft drinks. And he didn’t promise to earmark the proceeds for health programs. Instead, he cast the soft drink industry as a tantalizing revenue source that could be tapped to fund popular city programs, including universal prekindergarten. “This is the beginning of a process of changing the narrative of poverty in our city,” he said in a news conference after the vote. The advocates who have pushed for the policy say the victory is a sign of growing public acceptance of soft drink taxes and presages more such measures around the country. Though city officials didn’t talk much about the health consequences of soda, experts said that sugary drinks’ increasingly bad reputation made it an appropriate political target. “If we go five years ahead and look back, I think this is going to be a watershed moment,” said Jim Krieger, executive director at Healthy Food America, an organization that is helping cities around the country that are considering soda taxes. “This is going to really provide momentum. ” San Francisco Oakland, Calif. and Boulder, Colo. are considering soft drink taxes this year. Mr. Krieger said the list of interested cities included some that were as large and diverse as Philadelphia. Mr. Kenney said he hadn’t yet spoken directly with officials from other cities, but he had advice for them. “Tie your efforts to tangible initiatives that people care about,” he said in his news conference. “When it comes up, acknowledge that it is a good thing to drink less   beverages, but tie it to things that people care about. ” The Philadelphia tax of 1. 5 cents an ounce will apply to all sugary or artificially sweetened drinks sold by distributors in the city. It is expected to increase prices  —   the tax is about 30 cents for a   drink, or $2. 16 for a  . If passed on to consumers, the increase is expected to substantially reduce sales of sweetened drinks. The city finance department estimates it will raise $91 million a year. Sugary drinks have been linked to health problems, including obesity, diabetes and tooth decay, but the public health effects of the taxes are still unclear. Philadelphia is likely to become the site of public health research. Thomas Farley, the city’s health commissioner, said the city had already planned to measure the tax’s immediate effects on sales.   studies will measure any impact on obesity. The soft drink industry and its allies, including the Teamsters union and local grocers, spent nearly $5 million on lobbying and advertising to fight the tax in Philadelphia. They held rallies and demonstrations downtown and ran   ads on television and the radio, right up until Thursday’s final vote. They branded the drinks tax measure a “grocery tax,” suggesting that more food products were next. The soda industry has argued that Philadelphia’s politics are unusual and that the vote here can’t be seen as predictive. The American Beverage Association, a trade group, has vowed to fight the measure in the courts. “It’s still a bad idea,” said Lauren Kane, a spokeswoman for the group. “People still oppose it. Nothing has changed. ” Thursday, the industry and its allies vented frustration. Daniel Grace, the secretary and treasurer of the Teamsters local, said advocates had “snookered City Council,” and he described the tax as a “brazen cash grab from one industry. ” The promise of prekindergarten energized the city’s education advocates, who joined with public health advocates. The coalition spent about $2 million on advertisements, according to Kevin Feeley, a spokesman for Philadelphians for a Fair Future, a group supporting the tax. That total included $1. 6 million in donations from Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, who has long supported soda taxes.

    "Immigration. Just starting a column with that word sets people off nowadays. And that’s why I did it. But whom am I about to set off? Everyone  —   a little bit. But Democrats are the ones who might want to pay special attention. First off, immigration has served America well. The “melting pot” has made ours the world’s greatest country. There are practical issues supporting a   stance. Newcomers to this country have always filled many jobs that   and   folks don’t want. Think about who cuts your lawn, picks your food on the farm or washes your car and you can’t be against immigration. A more significant issue is America’s finances. This country will need to increase its workforce if it is to fix some of its major money problems. Social Security, for instance, will fail over the next few decades if the US doesn’t add significantly to the number of workers who are paying into that retirement system. And Americans just aren’t producing enough babies to do the job. Immigration will have to fill the gap. Nobody should be against welcoming good immigrants  —   those who contribute to this country, who work hard, pay their own way and help us move forward. The next great mind or the next best job creator might still be waiting to come to America. And, it goes without saying, we only want people who are here legally. But the opposite is also true  —   nobody should be in favor of welcoming bad immigrants to this country. By “bad” I mean people who want to hurt Americans and our country. Nobody  —   Democrat or Republican  —   would intentionally allow people who want to spread pain or terror into our country. So who can argue that all immigrants  —   Muslim or not  —   shouldn’t be extremely vetted. President Trump recently  . Trump also started deporting people who are in this country illegally, even though many have been in America for many years. And, of course, Trump has stood fast on his stance that a wall needs to be built between the US and Mexico. Support for these moves seems pretty strong among the president’s backers. But protests have erupted mainly on the two coasts, where Democrats are heavily in the majority. I doubt Trump did this on purpose, but his   stance on immigration  —   too hard, in my opinion  —   has created an incredible predicament for the Democrats. Why? Because the party’s tizzy, while playing well in New York and the West Coast, is merely the Dems “preaching to the choir”  —   telling supporters what they want to hear. But by sounding like they are against a temporary travel ban and not for a review of the already careful vetting of immigrants, Democrats will fail to expand their base. If they hadn’t noticed, they lost the last election. Are they really going to change the hearts and minds of the tens of thousands of voters in the three surprisingly red states by being against vetting immigrants? If the Democrats keep it up, they risk losing more seats in Congress  —   or worse.": "125783",
    "Lights, camera, Beckham. This is the  “Entertainment Tonight”  Six world that Odell Beckham Jr. and the Giants live in  —   a New York sports world that now revolves around him and Aaron Judge, the brightest stars in our constellation. Show’dell played Tuesday in East Rutherford, N. J. And Show’dell longs to play for the rest of his career in the only place that can effectively harbor his mushrooming fame. I asked him this question Tuesday at mandatory Giants minicamp: What was your reaction when John Mara said that he wants you to be a Giant for life? “I think we’re on the same page there,” Beckham said. “Obviously this is one of the best organizations in the league, and I would love to be here for the rest of my life. ” And he should know the New York Post will be with him every step of the way  —   every false step and every touchdown dance step, however he chooses to emblazon us on his cleats, whether his advisers and sycophants like it or not. For Beckham, for the Giants, this all boils down to a matter of trust. The Giants trust that Beckham will grow up then show up as the best receiver in the NFL. Beckham trusts that the Giants will make him the   receiver in the game no later than before the start of the 2018 season, and my instincts tell me that there is an understanding between the sides that a   will get done. Beckham   with his OTA No’dell, and is shrewd enough not to bite the hand that will be feeding him with a holdout. “I don’t really think that really proves a point in my opinion,” he said. “I was just really out there [Los Angeles] taking that time for myself to reflect on life and value what’s really important, and to grow, to mature. You should be growing each and every year, each and every day, until the day you leave this earth. ’’ He talked so much about growth during his absence from OTAs  —   growth from this, growth from that, growth from losing in the playoffs and learning and growing just like LeBron James has to learn and grow from losing the NBA Finals —   that you had to look twice to make sure he hadn’t turned into Judge. “I have got some gray hairs now, so I’m starting to get up there,” Beckham joked. “I’ve been trying to read a couple books. ‘The Four Agreements’ is one book that I picked up. There is just four basic principles that are in there, and one of them that you really had to learn was ‘use your words wisely and don’t take anything personal ever,’ and as you kind of get this guideline of this book it starts to help you grow and really mature into who you are as a person. Like I said, I’ve gotten a couple gray hairs and I feel as if I am a little bit wiser. ” Much better if Show’dell doesn’t just tell us, and especially Giants general manager Jerry Reese. “Growth is something that, it’s a lifetime,” Beckham said. “If you stop growing you’re not really aren’t progressing in life, so we all can grow as well, each and every day. ” Eli Manning hardly sounded insulted that Beckham was away catching passes from Johnny Manziel. “I was in that same position years ago and had to go through it, had to mature, had to realize things, and just understand how to handle everything that is kind of thrown at you and I think he is doing a good job doing that,” Manning said. Of course, Manning never hung out with Drake or Khloe Kardashian or Iggy Azalea or Justin Bieber and Trey Songz and   …     so far be it for him to offer Show’dell advice about handling fame. “Obviously, he is at a whole new level.   …     I don’t know if I’m the one to give advice on that, but I think he is doing a good job,” Manning said. Of course, the    Manning mostly sees the    Beckham within the friendly confines of the Quest Diagnostics Center and MetLife Stadium. The Giants never have housed this kind of celebrity before. “The NFL has changed, social media, all that has changed since I have been a New York Giant, and so you do have to understand the different personalities and different mindsets of people and how to adjust and handle them,” Manning said. What the Giants are counting on is Beckham’s football addiction, and his quest to be legendary. He genuinely was happy to be back among his teammates, especially   wide receiver Sterling Shepard. “It was great just to walk into the room,” Beckham said. “Seeing some new faces, but it is really a special bond when you get inside that room and the relationships that you build with each and every one of those guys, and to see young Shep, it just put a smile on my face. He has such a bright future ahead of him and he puts that smile on your face. “It reminds me of when I was young, it was my second year in the league, and you are just so happy to be here and to be happy to do what he is doing, so it is reassuring to see that from him. ” It was reassuring to the Giants to see that Tuesday from Beckham. As a matter of fact, it was reassuring to them to see him at all.": "133003",
    "LAS VEGAS  —   Maria Herrera, a    retired casino housekeeper, feels no affinity for Marco Rubio even as he aims to make history as the first Hispanic president of the United States. As she explained: “He’s Cuban. I’m Mexican. ” “Rubio says things that are not good for Mexicans,” Herrera said, adding that she supports Hillary Clinton. “I would never vote for him just because he’s Latino. ” Rubio, whose parents are from Cuba, and Ted Cruz, whose father was born in Cuba, are competing to be the first Hispanic in the White House  —   and casting unprecedented attention on the nation’s growing Hispanic vote. But in several key swing states  —   Nevada, Colorado, Florida and Virginia  —   most Latinos are not Cuban. Most lean Democratic  —   and identify more with their country of origin than with the broader terms, Hispanic or Latino, for those from   countries. Most also oppose both Rubio’s and Cruz’s positions on immigration reform. All of that, in addition to   tensions between Cuban and Mexican immigrants, could dash the GOP’s hopes that Cruz or Rubio could do what few Republicans have been able to do in a presidential election: attract significant Hispanic support.  [Rubio’s cousin, a Democrat, says Marco has his love but not his vote]    Republican presidential candidate, Sen. Marco Rubio ( .) took a break from campaigning Dec. 30 to watch his kids go sledding near the Iowa State Capitol. (AP)   Mexicans account for nearly   of the Latinos in the United States  —   about 35 million people. Cubans are the   group, after Puerto Ricans, with just 2 million people, or only 3. 7 percent of the Latino vote, according to the Pew Research Center.  In interviews in wedding chapels and casinos, all around this city of stretch limos, slot machines and neon signs, Mexicans who make up so much of the workforce said it would be far more meaningful to elect the first Mexican American president than the first Latino. Many said they would vote for a   over a Cuban American. In two days of interviews, not a single Mexican said he or she supported Rubio or Cruz, and even some Cubans said they don’t plan to support either Cuban American candidate. Part of the friction between Mexicans and Cubans comes from the starkly different reception they get when they arrive in the United States. Cubans who reach U. S. shores are almost automatically granted residency and eligibility for food stamps and other welfare benefits because of a special policy for those coming from the communist island  —   many arriving through Mexico. Mexicans who enter without legal papers live under the threat of deportation. There are cultural distinctions, too. They speak with different accents, celebrate different customs and eat different foods. Mexico is   while Cuba loves baseball.  “Except for the fact that they both speak Spanish, everything else is totally different,” said Carlos Artiles, 50, a bartender at the Florida Café Cuban Bar & Grill, where the eggs come with stuffed potatoes and fried plaintains. Artiles, a Cuban, quickly became a citizen, but he sees firsthand how Mexicans, including his wife, try unsuccessfully for years and “pay thousands of dollars to attorneys to help. It’s completely unfair. ” “No way” will Mexicans rally around presidential candidates just because they are Cuban, he said. “Like oil and water” is how Alejandro Carrillo, a Mexican salesman, describes Mexicans and Cubans. He said he believes that Cubans have it easier in the United States and often act as though they are better than Mexicans. As he shopped in Moda Latina, looking at cowboy boots and hats, Carrillo said the differences between Cubans and Mexicans extend right down to how they dress: “I never once saw a Cuban who wore boots. ” About 30 percent of Nevada’s population and 20 percent of its electorate is Latino. Mexicans far outnumber any Latino group here, but Cubans command an outsize influence. Cuba had a thriving casino business when Fidel Castro seized control in 1959, and many Cuban casino workers fled the island and moved to this gambling mecca. For decades, Cubans have been influential in business,   media and politics  —   just as they are in South Florida, home to the greatest concentration of Cubans. Otto Merida, a prominent Cuban here who ran the Latin Chamber of Commerce for 40 years, said, “It would be a dream to have a Cuban American in the White House,” and he likes Rubio. But early on, Merida signed up to support former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. “If he could catch fire,” Bush would do very well with Mexican Americans because he is married to a woman born in Mexico, he said. Andres Ramirez, a Democratic strategist in Nevada, said that despite differences, many Cubans and Mexicans get along. Some Hispanics  —   no matter the nationality  —   will vote for a candidate “just because they’re a Latino, just like some people will vote for a woman because she is woman  —   but that is not the majority. ” “Surnames can matter, but people vote on policy and platforms,” Ramirez said. Rubio, whose wife is the daughter of immigrants from Colombia, has shown more ability to win over   Hispanics in Florida than Cruz has in Texas, when they ran their Senate races, according to exit polls. Rubio campaigns, in both English and fluent Spanish, about being the son of immigrants who came to America for a better life for their children.  But Fernand Amandi, managing partner of Bendixen & Amandi International, which frequently surveys the Hispanic community, said that in a presidential election, Rubio will face much more intense opposition because Democrats will highlight the fact that he yanked his support for comprehensive immigration reform. Cruz unequivocally  —   “today, tomorrow, forever”  —   opposes giving citizenship to millions of undocumented immigrants, a great number of whom are Mexican. Not all Mexicans interviewed were in the country legally, and some have legal status but not citizenship, and so they are not eligible to vote. But those Mexicans who are citizens, such as Herrera, who was washing her clothes in a laundromat, said they plan to vote for Clinton. The Republicans and Democrats are holding caucuses in Nevada next month, in the first   voting in the West, right after Iowa and New Hampshire. Herrera said she was more interested in having the first female president than the first Latino president. What Clinton says is more appealing to her than what she hears from Rubio or Cruz, she said. Many Cubans lavished praise on Rubio, who lived in Las Vegas as a child while his father worked as a hotel bartender and his mother as a maid. A few said they like Cruz but not enough to consider voting for him. And several Cubans said they support Trump, the candidate most despised by Mexicans. Trump has referred to some Mexicans as “rapists” and promised to build a gigantic wall on the border to keep Mexicans out. “Trump says what others won’t. He fears nothing,” said Elizabeth Abad, 46, who left Cuba a decade ago, became a U. S. citizen and works at the Florida Café. “I like his toughness. ” Sergio Perez, 47, owner of the Florida Café and the Havana Grill, where Rubio recently held a big rally, also thinks Trump is the best candidate “in these difficult times. ” Perez said people are anxious and cannot afford the same life  —   not even the same amount of groceries  —   they once had. “Nobody felt good this Christmas,” he said, adding that Trump, a businessman, knows how to build things and put people to work. “It’s a dream to have a Cuban guy as president,” he said about Rubio, whom he called “a beautiful guy, smart, charming. He could be a great vice president. ” But don’t expect Mexicans to vote for him because, Perez said, “Eighty percent of the Mexicans don’t like the Cuban people. ”": "209135",
    "U. S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley made a sharp speech at the U.

[In her address to the Council in Geneva —  the first by a U. S. Permanent Representative —  Haley renewed the U. S. commitment to human rights and, in particular, its commitment to women’s rights.   “There is no room here for cultural relativism,” she said: . @NikkiHaley: US will not sit quietly while this body, supposedly dedicated to #humanrights, continues to damage the cause of human rights. pic. twitter.   —   Department of State (@StateDept) June 6, 2017,  The U. S. has had a tense relationship with the Council since Trump took office, particularly over the Council’s   bias and its membership, which includes countries with poor human rights records, such as Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and Cuba. The U. S. has mulled leaving the Council for months and boycotted its opening session in March due to the   agenda. While Haley told the Council that the U. S. is “looking carefully” at U. S. participation in the body, she refrained from giving an outright ultimatum in her address. She did point to a side event on human rights abuses in Venezuela and warned the socialist country that it should step away from the Council if it cannot end its abuses. “If Venezuela cannot, then it should voluntarily step down from its seat on the Human Rights Council until it can get its own house in order,” she said. “Being a member of this council is a privilege, and no country who is a human right violator should be allowed a seat at the table. ” She then drew a contrast with the way the Council treated Venezuela and the way it treated Israel. “It’s hard to accept that this Council has never considered a resolution on Venezuela, and yet it adopted five biased resolutions in March against a single country —  Israel,” she said. “It is essential that this Council address its chronic   bias if it is to have any credibility. ” Later Tuesday, Haley was scheduled to make an address to the Geneva Graduate Institute, where she said she will outline a plan to make the Council “more effective, more accountable and more responsive. ” Haley’s address comes days after she penned a withering   in the Washington Post in which she blasted the body as a “haven for dictators. ”  The Bush administration boycotted the Human Rights Council when it was formed in 2006 as a successor to the Human Rights Commission, which was also criticized for   bias and its membership.

    "On Monday, the White House announced Army Lt. General H. R. McMaster as the replacement for Michael Flynn as National Security Adviser. [McMaster was not one of the top candidates suggested by administration sources after President Trump’s first choice, retired Vice Admiral Robert Harward, declined the position. Over the weekend, President Trump began interviewing three new candidates, along with the current temporary occupant of the position, retired General Keith Kellogg. McMaster was one of the three, along with former U. N. Ambassador John Bolton and West Point superintendent Lt. Gen. Robert Caslen.  According to the White House announcement, Kellogg will continue serving under McMaster as chief of staff for the National Security Council. Thomas Ricks at Foreign Policy predicted McMaster would be Trump’s choice for National Security Adviser on Monday morning, describing him as “smart, energetic, and tough. ” “He has good combat experience, he was a good trainer, and he led the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment well in his deployment to Iraq, most notably in pacifying Tell Afar, to the west of Mosul,” Ricks wrote, adding that McMaster was supported to a “surprising degree” by people who had worked for him in the past. McMaster is the author of a   book on Vietnam, Dereliction of Duty: Johnson, McNamara, the Joint Chief of Staff, and the Lies That Led to Vietnam. The book strongly argues that military leadership should be willing to stand up to civilian political leaders when war is not waged successfully, and also criticizes   military leadership for becoming distracted by bureaucratic infighting. McMaster’s leadership at the famed Battle of 73 Easting in Operation Desert Storm was an important part of the U. S. military’s resurgence, poetically described as “exorcising the ghosts of Vietnam” at the time. In that battle, a vastly outnumbered American unit defeated Iraqi forces with superior tactics, coordination, and technology, without suffering a single casualty. Last February, McMaster wrote an extensive account of the battle, and the lessons it provides for future conflict, for The National Interest. He is noted as an advocate of both strong conventional military forces and   capability. Concerned by cuts to both manpower and equipment modernization, he warned the Senate last year that “we are outranged and outgunned by many potential adversaries  …     our Army in the future risks being too small to secure the nation. ” One of the lessons he recommends learning from the Battle of 73 Easting, a   on, is that American forces may never again have such a pronounced technological advantage over enemy ground forces. One of the adversaries McMaster particularly worries about is Russia. Defense One reported in May 2016 that he believes the Ukraine conflict has “revealed that the Russians have superior artillery firepower, better combat vehicles, and have learned sophisticated use of UAVs for tactical effect. ” McMaster feared American military planners have invested too much effort in “winning   missile duels,” proclaiming such tactics of limited use against the “dispersion, concealment, intermingling with civilian populations  …     the ability to disrupt our network strike capability, precision navigation and timing capabilities” demonstrated by Russian forces in Ukraine. He was also concerned about Russia’s advantages in battlefield artillery. He was also concerned about Russia’s advantages in battlefield artillery, including their use of cluster munitions, thermobaric warheads, and heavy use of electronic warfare, citing reports of Russia’s astonishing effectiveness at shutting down Ukranian tactical radios, drones, and even the electrical fuses on their artillery shells. Even the vaunted American technological edge in air supremacy, tanks, and armored fighting vehicles has dangerously eroded, in McMaster’s estimation.": "28802",
    "The European Union (EU) is going through an “existential crisis” that can only be solved through more military integration, Turkish accession and the creation of a “true union” EU chiefs have said. [In a document on the political union’s foreign policy objectives in light of the UK’s vote to leave, EU officials call for a “stronger Europe” the draws on “the combined weight of a true union”.  EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini points out in the foreword that “the European Union currently deploys seventeen military and civilian operations, with thousands of men and women serving under the European flag for peace and security” before calling for further integration. The document adds that the EU needs “full spectrum defence capabilities” and although it claims members states will “remain sovereign” in decisions of defence, it goes on to say: “To acquire and maintain many of these capabilities, defence cooperation must become the norm. ” In a strong hint that it plans to create a shared army that can operate alongside but also separately from Nato, it says that while the transatlantic defence organisation “exists to defend its members” Europeans “must be better equipped, trained and organised to contribute decisively to such collective efforts, as well as to act autonomously as necessary. ” It also calls for a “strong European defence industry” supported by “Union funds” and “multinational cooperation”. The EU’s military efforts will be bolstered  by a “diplomatic network” that runs “wide and deep in all corners of the globe” the document adds. However, in a reminder of one the pet hates of Eurosceptics, the document also contains a good deal of unclear jargon. At one point, it says: “The EU will be a responsible global stakeholder, but responsibility must be shared and requires investing in our partnerships.   will be our guiding principle in advancing a   global order. ” In terms of Turkish membership, the document is clear that it should happen as soon as possible. At one point it outlines the EU’s desire to expand further, calling for a “credible accession process” for the countries of the Western Balkans and Turkey. In the meantime, it also calls for greater cooperation with Turkey in the hope that it can bring the country’s Islamist government in line with EU accession criteria, including a restoration of relations with the EU state of Cyprus.  Turkish citizens should also have easier visa access to the EU, it says. “The EU will therefore pursue the accession process  —   sticking to strict and fair accession conditionality  —   while coherently engaging in dialogue on   regional security and refugees. We will also work on a modernised customs union and visa liberalisation, and cooperate further with Turkey in the fields of education, energy and transport. ” The document is further evidence that EU leaders are trying to rush integration after the Brexit vote, in a bid to prevent other member states seceding. Earlier this week, the Chairman of the European Parliament Committee on Foreign Affairs, Elmar Brok, called for the creation of an EU army, telling German paper Die Welt: “We need a common (military) headquarters and a coalition (of EU countries) acting in accordance with the permanent structural cooperation of the EU Treaty. From such a group an EU army could eventually arise. ” The plans may come up against opposition from ordinary voters, however. Earlier this year, a Pew poll showed that the vast majority of EU citizens were reluctant to increase defence spending. Of all 28 EU member states, only Poles and the Dutch favoured an increase.": "38432",
    "A California high school senior headed for the Army is not allowed to wear an Army sash with his robe and mortarboard at his graduation Friday. [Elias Velazquez made a decision to enlist in the U. S. Army after he graduated from Redlands High School, but his school’s policy states that students cannot decorate their graduation gowns or caps except for California Scholarship Federation chords and sashes, KTTV reported.  “It means something really honorable to me, it’s a whole new life transition to me,” Elias said. Elias and his father are hoping the policy can be changed. “It’s kind of defeating the purpose of achieving that greatness,” Joe said. “We push our kids to strive and try to be better and do the best they can and then we tell them at their grad ceremony, ‘We need you all to be the same because we don’t want to hurt anyone else’s feelings. ’” His father, Joe, posted about the situation on social media to “open community dialogue” about the situation. “We’re simply trying to open some community dialogue and get people to understand some rules are okay to change,” Joe said. The Redlands School District said the reason for the rules is to promote fairness and has nothing to do with not supporting the military. “We are totally supportive of our men and women in the military. This has nothing to do with a lack of our support,” a spokesperson for the district said. Although Elias says he is not happy about not being able to wear the sash, he is “committed to following every order they give” him since he is not one to stray from the rules. The school said that students can wear sashes during other graduation events and before and after the ceremony. A high school senior in Indiana was also told not to wear her Army sash at graduation May 25 because the school district wanted to focus on “high school accomplishments” at the graduation ceremony.

    "In the wake of Donald Trump’s election, some conservative Christians have been reckoning with feelings of alienation from their peers, who generally voted for Trump in strong numbers. But at least some progressive Protestant churches are experiencing the opposite effect: People have been returning to the pews. “The Sunday after the election was the size of an average Palm Sunday,” wrote Eric Folkerth, the senior pastor at Dallas’s Northaven United Methodist Church, in an email. More than 30   visitors signed in that day, “which is more than double the average [across] three weeks of a typical year,” he added. “I sincerely don’t recall another time when it feels like there has been a sustained desire on people’s part to be together with other progressive Christians. ” The Evangelical Reckoning Over Donald Trump, Anecdotal evidence suggests other liberal churches from a variety of denominations have been experiencing a similar spike over the past month, with their    levels of attendance staying relatively constant for several weeks. It’s not at all clear that the Trump bump, as the writer Diana Butler Bass termed it in a conversation with me, will be sustained beyond the first few months of the new administration. But it suggests that some progressives are searching for a moral vocabulary in grappling with the   —  including ways of thinking about community that don’t have to do with electoral politics. For progressives who expected Hillary Clinton to win, Trump’s victory was a shock. “I expected that I would be talking about reaching out to the people who lost,” said Debra Haffner, the minister at the   Unitarian Universalist Church in Reston, Virginia, in an interview. “My music director and I had talked about playing ‘Girl on Fire’ as our last song. Most of the people in our congregation supported the progressive candidate. ” Instead, she said, “people walked in here like they were going to a funeral. They were grieving, they were scared, and they needed hope. They needed community. ” Other pastors said they’ve heard similar themes in the past few weeks. In a small group discussion at Park Avenue Baptist Church in Atlanta, “many said that they felt personally threatened —  especially our LGBTQ folks,” said Trey Lyon, the pastor for communication and engagement. “Most of our folks are fugitives and refugees from the brand of ‘evangelicalism’ that elected Trump —  so for our folks it was mostly grieving and trying to figure out how the hell the people they grew up with could call themselves Christians and support Trump after all that he has unapologetically said and done. ” While a number of pastors spoke about their parishioners’ feelings of pain, they also spoke of a newfound sense of mission. “I am finding the coming Trump presidency   …     to be clarifying,” wrote Timothy Tutt, the senior minister at Westmoreland Congregational United Church of Christ in Bethesda, Maryland, in an email. “As a liberal Christian preacher it helps me find my voice. It helps me know who I am called to be. And helps our congregation know who we are —  and who we aren’t. ” Many progressive pastors are also trying to figure out the right political stance to take —  it’s difficult to determine how to stand up for their convictions while not alienating politically diverse congregations or their broader communities. “I believe Trump is the antithesis of everything Christian,” wrote Tricia Templeton, the rector at St. Dunstan’s Episcopal Church in Atlanta, in an email. “In the aftermath of this election, and with this administration, we are going to be called on to put our faith in action in ways we may not have done before. I think it is a time of true testing of our faith. ” People’s involvement in church is not neatly associated with the latest happenings in electoral politics. “Church attendance can be affected more by internal church factors than external events,” wrote Ben Hicks, the business manager and historian at St. George’s Episcopal Church in Fredericksburg, Maryland, in an email. “There are too many variables that affect attendance to isolate one —  weather, summer vacations, a baptism on a Sunday, an interim period, [or] Christmas [and] Easter, where you get people that attend once or twice a year. ” Some pastors said their congregations have seen temporarily higher levels of interest after big moments of crisis: The night after   when she was serving at a church in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Templeton said, she held a special service. “I thought maybe 40 or 50 people would come,” she said. “There were 400. ” Others mentioned Hurricane Katrina the 2012   shooting in Newtown, Connecticut the 2015 Emanuel A. M. E. Church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina and last spring’s massacre at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, as events that seemed to inspire people to show up in big numbers. After a while, though, attendance levels have typically returned to normal after such events. “My experience is that it doesn’t translate into   commitments,” Haffner said. She thinks their numbers could go up modestly in the coming months, but she’s more focused on making sure people found the home they were looking for after November 8, no matter how temporary. “My hope is that people who have been thinking about coming to a Unitarian Universalist church for a long time came and found a place for meaning and community,” she said. Even if Trump doesn’t bring about a membership revolution in the American mainline, which has been steadily shrinking for years, some of the conversations these Protestant pastors reported were fascinating —  and suggest that this political environment might be theologically, morally, and intellectually generative for progressive religious traditions. Lyon sent me an excerpt from a   sermon he gave, which argued that Christians cannot depend on the government for moral leadership: If the state will not provide rations, then we will learn anew how to plant our own seeds. If the state questions the covenant of marriage, the church will say, “What God has joined together let no one cast asunder. ” If the state says, “There isn’t enough to go around,” we will say, “Evidently you aren’t managing it right, because in God’s economy there is enough for everyone to have their fill and enough left over to take some home with you. ” Others have recently made arguments along these lines as well. “Most churches are either silent about social justice or have replaced the Gospel with the basic tenets of a progressive platform,” wrote the poet Alysia Harris in the magazine Scalawag after the election. “But the election of Trump shows that we need to reimagine how we go about seeking justice, and I believe the Gospel presents an approach that will be highly effective under a Trump presidency. The truth is: Our liberation cannot and never will be delivered by the hand of the state. ” More people may be making their way into progressive churches right now, feeling lost and alone and seeking moral guidance. While new bodies are often taken as the most telling sign of revitalization, though, that may not be the case here. The preaching, and the new directions it may take, could end up being just as important.": "82208",

Clinton Cash debuted last year at number two on the New York Times bestsellers list, remained fixed there for ten weeks, is currently on the NYT paperback list for three weeks running, is currently #1 on the NYT graphic novel bestseller list, and has been viewed nearly 3. 5 million on YouTube in its documentary form in just the last several weeks. The progressive MSNBC said the film is “devastating” and “powerfully connects the dots. ” The liberal Guardian says it’s “  …    a powerful message, one that is clearly designed to stir up trouble at the convention at just the moment when Clinton should be reveling in her victory in the Democratic race. ” Time Magazine calls it “a scathing broadside aimed at persuading liberals [and] is likely to leave    Clinton supporters who see it feeling more unsure about casting a vote for her. ” The film’s producer, of course, is former Breitbart News Executive Chairman and current Donald Trump campaign CEO Stephen K. Bannon. Ergo, Team Hillary’s latest attempt to trash Breitbart Nation and its 31 million monthly readers as racist. Put simply, the tsunami of verified and confirmed Clinton Cash revelations are now engulfing Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Nearly a dozen progressive media outlets and journalists have joined the deafening chorus of voices calling for Hillary’s embattled and corrupt Clinton Foundation to stop serving as a favor factory for foreign oligarchs and to shut down operations immediately. The Associated Press reports that over half of Hillary Clinton’s nongovernmental meetings at the State Department took place with Clinton Foundation donors. Emails uncovered by Judicial Watch reveal Hillary’s top aide Huma Abedin coordinating foreign favors with the Clinton Foundation, including greasing requests for billionaire   oligarch Gilbert Chagoury, a former business associate of the late billionaire fugitive Marc Rich. On Wednesday, the Democrat presidential nominee went on CNN to try and tamp down calls for her foundation to close. Liberal CNN host Anderson Cooper asked Clinton, “Why was it okay for the Clinton Foundation to accept foreign donations when you were secretary of state, but it wouldn’t be okay if you were president?” Clinton replied, “No, no. You know, look, Anderson, I know there’s a lot of smoke and there’s no fire. ” Hillary Clinton’s embarrassing and anemic response explains why she’s refused to hold a single press conference over the last 264 days. But it also underscored a deeper, more vexing problem for her campaign: there are no good answers to the myriad Clinton Cash revelations that continue to bedevil her candidacy. As Schweizer detailed last week, Hillary has still yet to answer even basic questions about her State Dept. auctioning policies to foreign Clinton Foundation donors: Hillary Clinton has not answered why her State Dept. approved the transfer of 20% of all U. S. uranium to Russia while not disclosing to the Obama administration that nine investors in that uranium deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation. Hillary Clinton has not answered why her brother, Tony Rodham, sat on the board of a company that received a rare “gold exploitation permit” from the Haitian government while she was dispersing billions of U. S. taxpayer dollars in Haiti earthquake disaster relief. Hillary Clinton has not answered why she hid $2. 35 million in Clinton Foundation donations from the head of one of the Russian government’s uranium companies. Hillary Clinton has not answered why she has yet to release the names of the 1, 100 foreign Clinton Foundation donors that both Bloomberg and the Washington Post confirm remain secret. Hillary Clinton has not answered why it was appropriate for Bill Clinton to deliver a $500, 000 speech in Moscow paid for by a   bank while she led the   Russian reset as Sec. of State —  a Clinton Cash revelation so egregious, that even the progressive New Yorker magazine was left to ponder, “Why was Bill Clinton taking any money from a bank linked to the Kremlin while his wife was Secretary of State?” Hillary Clinton has not answered why her current campaign chairman, John Podesta, sat on the board of a company alongside Russian officials that received $35 million from Rusnano, Vladimir Putin’s funding apparatus. Until Hillary’s campaign can concoct answers to those and other questions, they have decided the best they can do is “run out the clock” and label anyone who holds different ideas or opinions as racist. It’s a sad and desperate denouement to Hillary Clinton’s unprecedented Clinton Foundation corruptions.": "34220",
    "In southern Moravia, there’s a town called Valtice. With some friends, I have some ribs. I think they may be the best ribs I’ve ever had  —   including in Texas, the Carolinas, Memphis, and New York. The Czech lands, at least some of them, are known for pork. Not very long ago, I saw and wrote about a play by Vaclav Havel: The Pig, all about a pig roast. Funny to think of, isn’t it? Out for a walk in Budapest, I come to an intersection. I have to press a button, to put the lights in my favor. To make the traffic stop. The word on the device is “VARJON. ” Huh. Several times, I have reviewed a Hungarian pianist, Denes Varjon. Turns out the name means “Wait. Hold on. Cool your jets!” I can tell you that it’s  . Properly written, it’s “Eötvös. ” One more musical note? From fairly far away, I spot a bust of Liszt. Handsome devil. Helluva swordsman in his younger days. He grew religious, or at least mystical. Don’t know about then   …     Budapest has a lovely monument to Shakespeare, showing the playwright bowing. It is we who must bow to him, of course. Funny to have referred to him as a playwright. He tried his hand at poetry, too. This is pretty good: a shop called, simply, the “Biggest Souvenir Shop. ” A sign also advises that you can use the toilet. Must be good for business. Everyone searches out a toilet. Then you may well buy an item or two: out of convenience, or gratitude (for the use of the facilities)  —   or maybe even out of a sense of obligation. I wish I had a business mind. If you do, I salute you. Behold the Gresham Palace. It is a stunning building, an example of Art Nouveau. It is now a Four Seasons hotel. Imagine holing up there for a weekend, or a week, or a month. I’ll have to leave it at imagining   …     Walking outside Parliament, I can’t help thinking of Janos Horvath. He is one of the grand men of Hungarian politics. I interviewed him a few years ago. He was a political prisoner of the Nazis, and then of the Communists. Dodged death more than once. After the war, he was the youngest member of Parliament. Then came a long, productive American exile. (Ran for Congress, as a Republican!) After the fall of Communism, he returned to Hungary, where he reentered Parliament as the oldest member. How thrilling it must have been  —   how satisfying  —   to reenter that body, after all that time. It must have been a dream come true, really. Not so much his personal return to Parliament, but the death of Communism and the reintroduction of democracy. As we are sailing along, I have to tell you: The Danube is more green than blue. The waltz is “On the Beautiful Blue Danube. ” I’m sure it got that name for a reason. The reason, I don’t quite see, with my own eyes   …     There is an eatery in Bratislava: the Ankara Kebab Shop. Bet it’s good. There are Ankara Kebab Shops all over the world. They tend to be good. And I have a related item: In Vienna, I go into the Mozart Café, hard by the Sacher Hotel. (Within it? I’m not sure.) What do you get, if you’re in the mood for something sweet? A slice of Sacher cake, of course. It would be strange not to. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the worst piece of Sacher cake I have ever had in my life. (And I’ve had dozens.) (Okay, hundreds.) Drier than the Sahara. Without the schlag, it is barely edible, and it’s barely edible then. I report this to a friend of mine (Bill Kristol). He says, “Decline of the West. ” I say, “Yes: but I bet the falafels, all over, are wonderful. ” Incidentally, the best slice of Sacher cake I have ever had was in Anif, outside Salzburg  —   at the Friesacher Hotel. I’ve had many slices at the Sacher Hotel (in Salzburg). Hit or miss. May be the same way at the Friesacher, not sure. My sample there is too small   …     In Vienna, as in Salzburg and elsewhere in Austria, pedestrians wait at the red lights. Even if there are no cars within miles. They wait and wait until that sucker turns green. My American feet can hardly stand it. But if you bolt, while others are waiting, it feels awkward. This goes triple when there are children with their parents. You know? It is a shock, for someone like me, who lives in New York, to see female cabbies. Attractive, young female cabbies. I think, “This is a sign of a civilized place. ” Would you want your daughter to be a cabbie in a big city? I have a feeling that Viennese fathers don’t mind. (That Vienna has not always been a civilized place, I don’t need to state. Do I?) St. Stephen’s Cathedral is very, very old. But there’s a touch of the modern here now. Three words are beamed up toward the ceiling, from a projector of some kind: Glaube, Hoffnung, and Liebe, which is to say, “faith,” “hope,” and “charity. ” This mingling  —   of the medieval and the modern  —   is nicely brought off, I must say (conservative that I am). I peek into another church  —   very, very ornate. Sort of the church version of    Trump’s club in Palm Beach. (I had a very nice evening there once. I liked the club, even if it was “over the top. ” There’s room in life for   . Not everything can be under.) A sign says that a choir from Baylor University will sing here in the church. They’ll sing Bach and Pärt (i. e. Arvo Pärt, the contemporary Estonian)  —   and the Alleluia of Randall Thompson, one of the great hits of the American choral repertoire. Glad about that. Cruising along the Danube is a ship called “Jane Austen. ” Funny to think of the writer honored in a ship’s name! But why not? The greatest compliment ever paid an author, I think, was paid to Jane Austen  —   by I forget which Oxbridge don. Someone said to him, “You don’t read novels, do you?” He said, “I certainly do: I read all six of them every year. ” (I’ve never gotten through one, but we can discuss that another time.) You don’t want to get in the way of someone’s picture. You want to wait till he snaps. For years  —   eons  —   you could pass behind the  . But what do you do now? It can be impossible to know whether the guy’s taking a selfie or not. You don’t know which way the camera, or “camera,” is pointing. Do you know what I mean? Aboard our ship are conservative luminaries: Mona Charen, David   Charles Murray, John O’Sullivan, others. Those others include General Ervin Rokke, of the Air Force. He is an hombre and a half. Tall, authoritative, gentlemanly. His name is pronounced “Rocky. ” The general is from Minnesota and a   Norwegian. He went to the Air Force Academy. And then Harvard, for two degrees  —   master’s and Ph. D. His dissertation adviser was Kissinger. In the military, Rokke played many, many roles. Later, he was a college president. Now he does other things. We talk about multiculturalism, and the importance (as we see it) of E pluribus unum, one America. He mentions the time he began to study Norwegian. His aunt was alarmed. She said to his father, “Our family has been trying to get rid of a Norwegian accent for 50 years. And now this?” I love the study of languages  —   but I also love the assimilationist spirit. Speaking of language: General Rokke tells a story about a pilot, on a flight. The pilot in question “greased the landing. ”   people like me tend to like military lingo. May give us a vicarious thrill. Share article on FacebookshareTweet  To Linz. Home of Bruckner. And the Wittgensteins. And   . On the Old Cathedral is a plaque honoring Bruckner. He served as organist here. Don’t get me started on Bruckner  —   a composer about whom I love to talk (and on whom I once lectured in these very parts). I figure I should get some Linzer torte, but it doesn’t happen. Could it be for the best, given my experience with the Sacher variety in Vienna? I do see people eating ice cream  —   quite older people, who are licking their cones with relish. I like this sight. And I’m reminded of something. Years ago, in an   parlor in Washington, D. C.  —   Thomas Sweet (Georgetown)  —   I looked over and there was Bob Hope. He was licking a cone, and enjoying it very much. He was very, very old. His skin was translucent. I smiled at him and gave him a  . He grinned at me the most beatific grin ever grinned. It was such an odd and wonderful experience. I can’t tell you. To Passau  —   Passau, Germany. It is the “City of Three Rivers. ” “I thought that was Pittsburgh,” I remark to a local. He says, “We were here first!” Lots of Germans in Pittsburgh, too, by the way. As for Passau, I suppose I’ve seen a more beautiful city  —   I just can’t remember it. Passau is pretty much unsurpassed, in my experience. I see a sign for Rohrbach  —   which lets me know where Dana Rohrbacher’s ancestors came from, at least some of them. (Rohrbacher was a Reagan speechwriter and is a California congressman.) Above, I wrote “Passau, Germany. ” Bear with me for a second. To senior citizens, a city, followed by a comma, followed by “Germany,” is normal. It is normal to young or youngish people, too. When I was growing up, there was no “Germany. ” I would occasionally read old literature and see “Magdeburg, Germany,” for example. Or “Aachen, Germany. ” That looked antique  —   truly out of another era. Because Germany had been divided into West and East forever, or so I thought. It was all I knew. Then, after 1990, towns were called, for example, “Magdeburg, Germany. ” I can’t tell you how weird that looked to me. Which must seem very weird now. But not to those in my age bracket, probably. On my way home, I meet a young Dutchman. He lived in America for six months, training as a pilot. (Hope he greases landings.) He was in Phoenix. Loves America. “What do you like about it?” I ask. The food, for one thing. “Do you like hamburgers?” I ask. “I like Five Guys,” he says. “But I also love Bombay Express. And the Cheesecake Factory. There’s nothing like American cheesecake. It’s not nearly as good in the Netherlands, because of our health regulations. We can’t make food as rich. In America, there are no such regulations. So you can make cheesecake good and full and right. ” I’ll be damned. Never thought of that. But don’t give our regulators any ideas. The last thing they need is encouragement. There’s something else this young Dutch pilot likes about America: Ross Dress for Less. I’ve never heard of it. But I’ve never heard of a lot of things. And the name is damn catchy. Why am I ending on America in a Danube journal? Don’t know. But I thank you for joining me, and wish you the very best.": "119273",
    "The good folks at NASA never miss a chance to let us know when vital bodies of water around the world are shriveling up and vanishing. First it was Lake Mead. Then it was the Aral Sea.     Now it’s poor Utah’s turn. Earlier this week, NASA’s Earth Observatory posted satellite images showing the dramatic decline of Utah’s Great Salt Lake over the past five years. As the two images below from 2011 and 2016 show, water levels at Farmington Bay have plummeted, exposing   of the lakebed and threatening a key waterfowl habitat:                                       Suffice to say, that’s not good. The Great Salt Lake is one of the natural wonders of the West. It’s a terminal bay, which means rivers and streams flow in, but there’s nowhere for water to leave  —   except through evaporation. As a result, the minerals left behind just keep piling up. Today, NASA notes, the lake’s water is three to five times saltier than the ocean’s, creating a rich ecosystem that sustains brine shrimp, millions of migratory birds, waterfowl hunting, and so on. Mineral industries rely on it. It’s a key part of Utah’s economy, worth some $1. 2 billion per year.  Why the Great Salt Lake is drying up and shrinking But the lake is now in trouble. Ever since the first pioneers arrived in 1847, humans have been diverting more and more water from the rivers and streams that would otherwise feed the Great Salt Lake. Today, about 40 percent of that water gets used instead by farms, cities, and industry  —   causing the lake to recede.    The problem has only been exacerbated of late by brutal droughts (the sort of droughts, note, that are likely to get worse as global warming continues). Water levels in the lake are currently about 11 feet below their historic levels:            A recent paper, led by Utah State University’s Wayne Wurtsbaugh, warns that if water diversions continue to increase, it’s not impossible to imagine the lake drying up completely. The same thing happened to southern California in the 1920s, when water diversions to Los Angeles desiccated Owens Lake.    When a lake like this goes dry, things can get ugly. The paper notes that Los Angeles has spent at least $1. 3 billion since 2000 dealing with dust from the exposed Owens Lake lakebed  —   a major source of harmful particulate pollution that causes asthma and other lung ailments. Utah has already gotten a taste of this future: back in August 2015, a massive (and deadly) dust storm engulfed Salt Lake City.    And that’s just the start. If the lake keeps drying up, the paper notes, the region’s $57 million brine shrimp industry will wither. Water fowl will start to disappear, crippling the region’s $70 million hunting industry. Industries that harvest brine or minerals from the lake, like Morton Salt, will also suffer. Can Utah save the Great Salt Lake? The way to avoid this dire scenario is straightforward: stop diverting so much water from the lake. There’s some reason for optimism here: Wurtsbaugh and his colleagues note that per capita water use in cities dropped 18 percent between 1989 and 2000 (though overall urban water use is up 5 percent, as the population has grown). Conservation is possible; humans are surprisingly good at it when they have to be. But the real challenge will be convincing farmers, who account for 63 percent of the region’s water use, to join in the conservation efforts. There’s also a debate around nascent plans to develop of Bear River, which is the biggest river feeding the lake. An effort to divert drinking water from that river for   cities and towns in the Wasatch Front could shrink lake levels an additional 8. 5 inches, officials have said.    So it’s your standard tragedy of the commons. Here’s how Wurtsbaugh and his colleagues conclude: “We must be willing to make decisions now that preserve Great Salt Lake’s benefits and mitigate its negative impacts into the coming centuries. ” As water journalist John Fleck told me in this recent interview, states and localities in the American West have actually been surprisingly good at responding to tragedy of the   problems over the past few decades. The Great Salt Lake is going to be an important test case here. Because the last thing anyone should want is to replicate what happened to the Aral Sea.  Further reading  —   Seriously, the disappearance of the Aral Sea is an excellent warning for what happens when you let a   lake go dry.   —   Everyone’s worried the West is running out of water. The reality is more complicated.": "202986",
    "Fired FBI Director James B. Comey said President Trump told him at the White House “I need loyalty, I expect loyalty’’ in their private White House dinner conversation in January, according to written testimony prepared by Comey.  In written remarks submitted to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Wednesday  —   a day before his   testimony  —   Comey said he remembered nine separate private conversations with President Trump. Three were in person and six on the phone.  Comey said the president called him at lunchtime on Jan. 27 to invite him to dinner.  “It was unclear from the conversation who else was going to be at the dinner, although I assumed there would be others,’’ Comey wrote. “It turned out to be just the two of us, seated at a small oval table in the center of the Green Room. Two Navy stewards waited on us, only entering the room to serve food and drinks. ’’ The president began the conversation, Comey wrote, by asking him if he wanted to stay on as FBI Director, “which I found strange because he had already told me twice in earlier conversations that he hoped I would stay, and I had assured him that I intended to. ’’       (Bastien   Washington Post)   The president replied, according to Comey, that lots of people wanted his job and “he would understand if I wanted to walk away. ’’ Comey’s instincts, he wrote, were that both the setting and the conversation “meant the dinner was, at least in part, an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship. That concerned me greatly, given the FBI’s traditionally independent status in the executive branch. ’’  The president then made his demand for loyalty.  “I didn’t move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed,’’ Comey wrote. “We simply looked at each other in silence. The conversation then moved on, but he returned to the subject near the end of our dinner. ’’  [Read Comey’s prepared remarks for his upcoming testimony]  When prompted again on the subject of loyalty, Comey said he replied, “You will always get honesty from me. ’’  Comey said that once before Trump’s inauguration, and again at the January dinner, he assured the president that he was not personally under investigation. He also told the president later on that he had shared that information with congressional leaders.  In essence, Comey’s written testimony confirms a key claim that Trump has made  —   that three times, Comey told the president he was not under investigation. But it also paints a portrait of a strained, awkward relationship between the two men, in which the president frequently expressed his displeasure about the Russia probe in ways that alarmed the FBI director. The written testimony also recounts a    conversation the two men had on February 14  —   Valentine’s Day  —   at the Oval Office, where many senior officials had gathered for a counterterrorism briefing. After the meeting, the president asked everyone to leave. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and senior adviser Jared Kushner lingered in the room, but the president told them to leave, too, according to Comey.  When the door by the grandfather clock closed, Comey wrote, the president said “I want to talk about Mike Flynn’’  —   the former national security adviser who was forced out after disclosures about his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the U. S. Sergey Kislyak. Flynn had resigned a day earlier. “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go,’’ the president said, according to Comey. The FBI director replied only that “he is a good guy. ’’ In that conversation, the president repeatedly complained to the FBI director about leaks, and Comey said he agreed with him about the harm caused by leaks of classified information.  Comey said he understood the president to be asking for him to “drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador in December. I did not understand the president to be talking about the broader investigation into Russia or possible links to his campaign. ’’ The former FBI director wrote that he found the conversation “very concerning, given the FBI’s role as an independent investigative agency. ’’ Later, Comey complained to Sessions that he should not have been left alone with the president, and Sessions did not reply, according to the written testimony. Then, in late March, Trump called Comey at the FBI. In that conversation, the president called the Russia probe “a cloud’’ hanging over his ability to lead the country. He also expressed continued frustration that unsubstantiated allegations in a private dossier about him had become public, including lurid claims of sexual activity while in Russia. “He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he had been recorded when in Russia,’’ Comey wrote. “He asked what we could do to ‘lift the cloud.’ I responded that we were investigating the matter as quickly as we could, and that there would be great benefit, if we didn’t find anything, to our having done the work well. He agreed, but then   the problems this was causing him,’’ Comey wrote. After that phone call with the president, Comey said he called acting deputy attorney general Dana Boente to tell him what was discussed, and “await his guidance. ’’ Comey said he never heard back from Boente.  Then, on April 11, Comey wrote, the president called him and asked him what he had done about getting out word that he was not personally under investigation. The president told him “the cloud’’ of the probe was interfering with his ability to do his job. “I have been very loyal to you, very loyal; we had that thing you know,’’ Trump told Comey, according to the written testimony. “I did not reply or ask him what he meant by ‘that thing. ’’’ He added: “That was the last time I spoke with President Trump. ’’": "208150",
    "Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said Monday that the Fed was shifting its focus from stimulating the economy to keeping growth on an even keel. She said the economy was “pretty healthy,” thanks in part to the Fed’s   stimulus campaign, which the central bank is moving to end. “Looking forward, I think the economy is going to continue to grow at a moderate pace,” Ms. Yellen said during an event at the University of Michigan. “Our job is going to be to try to set monetary policy to sustain what we have achieved. ” The Fed raised its benchmark interest rate in March for the third time since the financial crisis, and said it planned two more rate increases this year. The Fed also said it planned to begin reducing its large holdings of securities by the end of the year. Ms. Yellen did not offer any additional details during her appearance on Monday. Ms. Yellen, interviewed onstage by Susan M. Collins, the dean of the Ford School of Public Policy at the university, used the opportunity to make a strong case for the financial regulations enacted by Congress in the 2010   Act to address the problems revealed by the 2008 financial crisis. President Trump and congressional Republicans have said they want to eliminate or overhaul many of those measures, which they regard as ineffective in preventing future financial crises and as impediments to economic growth. Ms. Yellen pushed back on both counts. She cited changes that she said had increased the strength of the financial system, including requiring banks to raise more money from investors and subjecting large banks to annual stress tests. “We have accomplished a lot, and we have a much safer system,” she said. She also directly addressed the argument that the regulatory pendulum has swung too far and that government rules are preventing healthy financial activity. “I don’t think if you look at objective data on lending, that it’s possible to make the case that regulation has simply stifled lending,” Ms. Yellen said. “Lending is growing in a very healthy way as the economy has recovered. ” She said banks were actually in a better position to lend, although she acknowledged that the Fed would like to reduce the burden on smaller banks. Ms. Yellen’s assessment of economic conditions remained upbeat. She noted that the unemployment rate, which fell to 4. 5 percent in March, is now below the level that most Fed officials regard as sustainable. Consumer spending is growing at a decent pace, and Ms. Yellen noted that the global economy was also looking “slightly more robust and healthier. ” Though inflation remains a bit weaker than the 2 percent annual pace the Fed regards as healthy, she said it would be appropriate for the Fed to keep raising interest rates. She said, however, that the economy still faced problems that were beyond the power of monetary policy. While job growth has been strong, economic growth remains relatively slow, around 2 percent a year in recent years. If more people are working, making more things or doing more things in less time, the economy should be growing faster. “The fact that you can create that many jobs in the context of growth that is so low points to a significant problem,” Ms. Yellen said. “And the problem is that productivity growth is very low. ” Productivity measures the average person’s economic contribution. There are only two possible causes of economic growth: more people or increased productivity, which is to say, the same number of people making more stuff. We have slow population growth and slow productivity growth, so we have slow economic growth. Economists regard the slow pace of productivity growth as something of a mystery. Ms. Yellen tipped her hat to a number of the theories in circulation. Some economists think the flow of good ideas has simply slowed. Others point to a   in educational attainment. She also pointed to recent research that suggested one factor was a decline in corporate competition: less creation of new businesses and more corporate consolidation. Ms. Yellen said the combination of relatively fast job growth and relatively slow economic growth pointed to the underlying problem. She also fielded some lighter questions. Asked how she dealt with pressure, Ms. Yellen described herself as an “ardent believer” in the importance of a good night’s sleep. Asked for life advice, she encouraged students to find a profession that fills them with a sense of enthusiasm every day. “For me,” she said, “the core of having a satisfying career first and foremost was finding something to do that I really love. ”": "20029",
    "My loving parents taught me how to speak, but they also taught me silence. I only know that my father voted for Trump because my mother  —   a Clinton supporter  —   asked on the evening of November 8, hours after they voted. They had not otherwise spoken about politics during the election season.     Nearly everyone I have spoken to has said that at least one of their family members voted for Trump too. Many weren’t even Trump supporters; they were “Never Hillarys. ” But that means little now that Trump is  . Growing up in Miami, Florida, where my parents still live, I was happily surrounded by different languages and cultures and more diversity than most places in the United States possess; as a white woman, I was the minority. I learned to speak Spanish at the grocery store and local bakery and my friends’ houses. Trump represented a dismissal of many of those historically marginalized cultures I had grown to love and feel a part of. I voted for Clinton because she seemed to represent equality for women and people of color, but more so because she did not represent the Islamophobic, homophobic, sexist, and racist thinking that Trump does. Almost everyone in the city of Boston, where I now teach and live, voted with this in mind too.     How was it possible that my own father voted for Trump?     I didn’t talk to my dad about Trump before the election Nearly every day for the past year, I worried how my father, who had lived in South Carolina until his late 20s, would vote. Deep down, I knew the answer, but I naively maintained my optimism. I often scanned his Facebook page, hoping not to find Trump propaganda. Most of his posts seemed harmless, often about his alma mater and their upcoming football games. He is often silent about politics. He never “likes” my Facebook posts about immigration or institutional racism or human rights. He only “likes” photos of me and posts about my personal achievements. Once, when he uncharacteristically shared an article about “illegal immigrants,” I commented and expressed my disagreement. He never commented back.     I was not surprised that my father had voted for someone who wanted to build a wall; I knew my father believed that immigrants must “do it the right way” and that they “need to assimilate into our society and help, not hurt, our country. ”  But the United States is born of immigrants; my father is here because his ancestors fled Scotland in the 1700s  —   fled poverty, war, perhaps even sought asylum. Trump’s mother is a Scottish immigrant too, a fact he often ignores; his paternal grandparents are German immigrants who claimed they were Swedish in order to avoid conflict with Jewish friends and customers. And, of course, Trump is married to an immigrant. How can we not remember our roots?  Can’t Trump voters see we are all human beings, some born into peace but so many into war? Can’t they see that white American citizens specifically live within a system that has handed them privilege for centuries, deluding them into believing they have done more than others to earn it? Can’t they see that this privilege is founded on years and years of slavery and oppression? That reaching out a hand to those who have been robbed in ways white American citizens never have is different from being taken advantage of?    I did not say any of this to my father before the election. Perhaps I feared that such questions would destroy our relationship. But does that mean I value one human life more than I do millions? What does that say about me? After Trump won, we had our first true talk about politics  —   ever A few days after the election, my father and I had the first true conversation we’ve ever had about politics. After Trump was elected, my frustration and anger was stronger than ever. I wanted to open some imaginary door at the back of everyone’s skulls, peer inside, and try to understand the engineering of their thoughts. A conversation with my dad  —   however belated  —   seemed like a first step at doing that. Still, my heart raced just thinking about talking to him. I was eager to hear his responses, but I was also eager to prove him wrong.  “I have to admit, I was scared to talk to you about this,” I said. “I know you probably weren’t, but I was. ” “No, no,” he said. “I was very nervous to talk about this with you too. ” Our shared emotion slowed my heartbeat, steadied my hands. “This country gives everyone the opportunity to succeed,” my father said, “but to succeed, each individual has to take responsibility for their own destiny. Less excuses and more work is the answer to their success. ”     “But not everyone is given equal opportunity yet,” I said. “No matter what the law claims to uphold. ”  “I understand,” he said. “And I’d have to do more thinking and reading on that to properly respond. ”  My hands shook again as I asked him if he ever reads my posts about political issues.   “I read them,” he said. “I sometimes feel uncomfortable, but I always respect your views and values, and I support your right to voice your opinions. Your views make me open up my thinking and consider the conditions that others have to deal with. You have challenged me to reconsider many philosophical issues. ” I was relieved that those articles had at least affected his thinking, but they clearly had not affected his actions. “I’m hoping [Trump] will talk less and listen more”  When I asked him to explain his reasons for voting for Trump, my father said he thought Obama’s presidency “has taken our country to the brink of bankruptcy. ” He said, “Something has to be done to bring back fiscal responsibility. We can’t just keep overspending and trying to make up for the reckless spending by increasing taxes. We need to bring manufacturing back to the United States from other countries. We need to give US businesses the breaks that are necessary to keep them here, rather than giving the breaks to foreign manufacturers. This will help our economy and provide jobs for our workers. I believe that Clinton would have continued Obama’s reckless spending and weak foreign policies and would have taken our country so far down that we might never have recovered. ”    “I respect and share your desire to ensure economic stability,” I said.  “It’s not all about economics, though,” he said. “Obama’s problematic dealings with Israel and his endorsement of countries that have vowed to take down the US scare me most. ”  “I understand the importance of those issues and, truly, I don’t know enough about Obama’s foreign policy to speak on it,” I said. “But more than anything, I cannot bring myself to prioritize those economic and international issues over the daily injustices and violence inflicted upon marginalized people and encouraged by Trump’s reckless rhetoric and thinking. ” “[Trump is] not a seasoned politician,” he said. “And he unfortunately says whatever is on his mind without thinking. I’m hoping he will talk less and listen more. ”  I told my father that I hope Trump will do more listening too. But that Trump says what is on his mind and that what is on his mind are Islamophobic, homophobic, sexist, and racist ideas is the ultimate reason to not vote for Trump. His decisions will surely be affected by that thinking. And so will all of those marginalized people for whom we’ve only recently begun to establish equal rights and protection. When I asked what my father thought of Trump’s bigoted remarks, he said, “Trump can be an idiot, but Hillary is truly dangerous. I believe Trump is smart enough to surround himself with highly qualified people who will advise him against such remarks. He has made some really stupid statements, which Hillary’s campaign has naturally made the most of. Hillary had a cast of thousands planning every word she has spoken and has spent a tremendous amount of money trying to overcome her shortcomings. ”    He also said he believes Trump’s endorsements from groups like the Ku Klux Klan are disgusting.  “But believing this disgusting does nothing to stop the violence they undoubtedly encourage,” I said. “Believing Clinton more dangerous than Trump, who has provoked sexual predators and bigots of all kinds, suggests a blindness  —   whether willful or not  —   we cannot ignore. ”  “I pray that none of those marginalized people are endangered,” my dad said. “Truly, I hope that Trump can make the pendulum swing back again from where it currently stands on the left. I hope we can find a middle ground, not swing too far right again and into a place where human rights are at risk. I really do. ”  “I know,” I said. “But I don’t think that’s a risk that anyone should be willing to take. ” “I always thought we were the greatest country on Earth, and I still do”  My father turned 70 last year. I wished him a happy birthday on the phone and later on his Facebook page, where I found another rare message he had shared, this one from a veterans group: “Never Forget. In Memory, 1959 to 1975, 58, 479 brothers and sisters who never returned from Vietnam War. ”  I can’t imagine what it’s like for my father to live with the memories of his time as a medic in Vietnam, but I’ve tried. He has always been present and loving, but he rarely discusses sensitive issues. It seemed like he’d been hoarding his thoughts and feelings for so many years that when I wondered about his concealed memories, I imagined them buried alive inside his head, tapping on the corners of his skull with tiny pickaxes, inmates trying to excavate their way out.     Because we had never talked about it, I assumed that he had tuned out Vietnam, or perhaps put that film on pause. I always thought part of him remembered  —   couldn’t not remember  —   and that he needed that pain to have been for something. If he could justify his grief, memories of grenades blowing off his buddies’ limbs and shrapnel shooting up his own legs, by continuing to “protect” this country  —   keep “illegals” out; keep Americans and their money and their land “safe”  —   then perhaps his trauma wouldn’t have been for nothing.  But when I asked my father about this after the election, he refused my theory.  “My experience in Vietnam didn’t change my views of America. I always thought we were the greatest country on Earth, and I still do,” he said. “I have always loved my country. I’m sure this is due to my family’s values and the values of the community where I grew up. I’ve never been given a reason not to love the United States of America. ” That might be the most important part of his response: Like most white, heterosexual, cisgender men, he has never been oppressed by his country.  When I mentioned this, I sensed our conversation was veering into rocky terrain. We were silent for a moment. I didn’t press. I didn’t think my father would talk to me about politics for the first time while also deeply considering his privilege. But it’s a conversation we still must have.   I think Trump votes are the result of pain  —   but they’ve also created deep pain Although my father claimed that Vietnam did not influence his vote, I still believe that everyone who voted for Trump likely has that something, that painful reason that compelled them to vote for him, that makes them need this country and its xenophobia in order to excuse a different pain. Protect America to make fallen soldiers matter. Protect America to make my mother’s job loss matter. Protect America to protect the excuse for killing more people  —   by continuing war, or by ignoring human rights issues.     But these responses to pain  —   these Trump votes  —   have inflicted a new pain. For many of us, we are mourning as we would a national tragedy.  At the end of our conversation, my father said, “The older I get, the more I realize I don’t know. More than ever before, I work now to really understand what is behind the actions of people. The one thing I will never be able to accept is negativity. ”  Perhaps I, too, had not been thinking enough about what I don’t know. Believing that the majority of our country had been thinking the way most of Boston had been was naive. After my conversation with my father, I realized that my own bubble might have prevented me from understanding other parts of the country, just as their bubbles might have stopped them from understanding me. I still strongly disagree with my father and Trump voters, but our conversation revealed, among many implicit biases, the danger of these   “coastal” and “rural” bubbles and the power and necessity of open dialogue. Sometimes those dialogues are hardest when they include the ones we love, but not engaging in them is a problematic exercise of privilege.  This conversation with my dad seems to signal a true willingness to listen, but how old must we be to truly understand each other? How old must we be to remedy mistrust of politicians and economic insecurity and scary foreign policies without electing a president like Trump?

    "David Mitchell, a regular contender for the Man Booker prize, is used to his novels being picked over by the critics. So it’s something of a relief, says the British author, that his latest work  —   completed at 1am one Tuesday morning before a car arrived to take him to the airport to catch a flight to Norway  —   won’t be seen by anyone until 2114. Mitchell is the second contributor to the Scottish artist Katie Paterson’s Future Library project, for which 1, 000 trees were planted two years ago in Oslo’s Nordmarka forest. Starting with Margaret Atwood, who last year handed over the manuscript of a text called Scribbler Moon, each year for the next 100 years an author will deliver a piece of writing which will only be read in 2114, when the trees are chopped down to make paper on which the 100 texts will be printed. Each author  —   their names revealed year by year and chosen by a panel of experts and Paterson, while she is alive  —   will make the trek to the spot in the forest high above Oslo, where they will surrender their manuscripts in a short ceremony. “It’s a little glimmer of hope in a season of highly depressing news cycles, that affirms we are in with a chance of civilisation in 100 years,” said Mitchell. “Everything is telling us that we’re doomed, but the Future Library is a candidate on the ballot paper for possible futures. It brings hope that we are more resilient than we think: that we will be here, that there will be trees, that there will be books, and readers, and civilisation. ” Mitchell said he found writing the book “quite liberating, because I won’t be around to take the consequences of this being good, or bad . .. But I’m sandwiched between Margaret Atwood, and no doubt some   other writer [yet to be revealed]. So it better be good. What a historic fool of epochal proportions I’d look, if they opened it in 2114 and it wasn’t any good. ” Usually, says Mitchell, who was shortlisted for the Man Booker for his novels number9dream and Cloud Atlas, he “polishes and polishes” his writing. “Actually I  . But this was very different  —   I wrote up to the wire. So the first   were polished, and the final third I didn’t have time. And it was a liberation. ” Contributors to Future Library can write whatever they like  —   poems, short stories, novels or    —   in any language. The only thing asked of them is that they do not speak about their writing, show it to anyone, and that they deliver one hard copy and one digital copy at the handover ceremony in Oslo. Writing about the project, the curator Lisa Le Feuvre said: “We have to trust that they have written  —   imagine saying yes, and then time running out. Nobody in your lifetime would know that you had just repeated the alphabet 100 times over. Does it matter if a writer is deemed lazy when they can’t hear the judgment with their own ears?” Future Library creator Paterson, whose past works have involved her mapping dead stars and compiling a slide archive of the history of darkness through the ages, asked the writers to tackle “the theme of imagination and time, which they can take in so many directions”. Mitchell revealed only the name of the manuscript, From Me Flows What You Call Time, during a Saturday ceremony in the Norwegian woods next to where Paterson’s 1, 000 trees are planted. The title is taken from a piece of music by Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu, but other than admitting that “it’s somewhat more substantial a thing than I was expecting” the author would say nothing more. Handing over his text in the forest, sheltered from the intermittent rain by an umbrella and amid the   shoots of 1, 000 pine trees, Mitchell read his damp audience of children and adults a short story and William Wordsworth’s A slumber did my spirit seal. Its ending, “Rolled round in earth’s diurnal course   With rocks, and stones, and trees” felt appropriate in this small section of forest, carpeted with blueberry bushes, which will be carefully tended to for the next 98 years before it is turned into Future Library’s manuscripts. “How vain to suppose the scribblings of little old me will be of enduring interest to future generations. Yet how   and understated, to slave over a manuscript that nobody will ever pat you on the back for and say: ‘Nice one’ or ‘God, I loved the bit where she did that and he did this . ..’” Mitchell wrote in a piece for the Future Library. His manuscript, now delivered, will be sealed and placed alongside Atwood’s in a   room in Oslo’s new public library, which will open in 2019. Watched over by a trust of experts until it is finally printed, it is now, says the novelist, “as gone from me as a coin dropped in a river”.": "152851",
    "The armed squatters at the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Oregon have begun rummaging through government documents at the reserve. According to ABC News, leader Ammon Bundy told reporters he is confident that he will find evidence in the  trove of files to help free Dwight and Steven Hammond, local ranchers convicted on arson charges who are currently serving out their sentences and who were the inspiration for the occupation of the refuge. Bundy’s group of militiamen are also hoping to ”expose” federal employees’ transgressions against local ranchers, ABC says. The document raid is just the latest example of destruction at the ranch. Monday, Bundy and his crew began tearing apart federal fencing at the reserve to allow one local rancher family to move its cattle through the area.  While they have accessed hard copies of government documents, ABC is reporting that the militiamen claim they are not searching government computers. Reporters over the weekend said they saw the militiamen using the computers, but Bundy and company denied it.  “No, we haven’t touched a single personal item. We haven’t touched any of the computers, we haven’t tried to log on —  we haven’t done anything,” Bundy told OPB reporter John Sepulvado.  Fish and Wildlife officials are concerned that uncovered documents could undermine the safety of federal employees’ whose names are on the them.  U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service Spokesman Jason Holm told ABC that Fish and Wildlife ”is taking necessary steps to ensure employee and family safety.” Harney County Sheriff Dave Ward told community members during a meeting Monday night that the militiamen have also been harassing federal employees around town in attempts to intimidate them.": "94715",
    "A Florida mother wrestled her own daughter from the arms of a   kidnapper inside a store Tuesday morning before an   sheriff’s deputy arrested the fleeing suspect. Authorities said Craig Bonello, 30, tried to grab the    who was shopping with her mother at a Dollar General store in Hernando.        Surveillance video shows Bonello attempting to run out of the store with the girl, but the teen’s mother caught up and a    ensued. Bonello eventually let go of the girl and ran toward the exit just as an   Citrus County sheriff’s deputy was getting out of his patrol car to go in the store. After being alerted by the store’s manager, Deputy Jonathan Behnen pulled his car around to block Bonello’s vehicle in the parking lot before ordering the suspect out of his car at gunpoint. “In my 10 years on the road I have never seen anything like this,” Sgt. Craig Callahan told Fox13. “He truly intended to abduct this child right in front of everyone in the store. ” Bonello faces charges of kidnapping and child abuse. He has a long criminal history and was most recently arrested for trespassing in February. Bonello was also charged with felony aggravated battery on a law enforcment officer in 2009. “We are very fortunate our deputy was there as quickly as he was. We are very fortunate that the mother had that motherly instinct and did what she did,” Callahan said. “She may have saved her daughter’s life today. I don’t exactly know a motive, but I know it wasn’t a good one. ” Neither the teen nor her mother was injured in the incident.": "134869",

    "“Downright nonsense” was the verdict of Mrs Augusta Bramston, a Hampshire friend and neighbour of the Austen family, on reading Pride and Prejudice. In 1814, Jane Austen published Mansfield Park, a sophisticated study of love and family life. Mrs Bramston nevertheless thought she ought to give it go, and having struggled through volume one, “flattered herself she had got through the worst”. Jane Austen recorded this and other hilarious remarks from friends in a list of opinions on Mansfield Park. The document, in Austen’s own neat handwriting, is just one of the funny and sad items in the British Library’s new exhibition, Jane Austen Among Family and Friends, which opened on Tuesday. Austen surely recorded the comments in a spirit of malicious mockery rather than regret. Even if only a small number of readers appreciated her at the time of her death in 1817, she hopefully knew just how brilliant a writer she was. Two hundred years later, everyone knows it. Her face is to appear on £10 notes and £2 coins, and the bicentenary of her death will see a slew of exhibitions showcasing her writing and world. The British Library show concentrates on the handful of people who did value Austen: her family and friends. To them, she was not just an entertaining writer, but a daughter, sister and especially an aunt to her 33 nieces and nephews. Yet, while the Austens were proud of her, they couldn’t quite comprehend that she had published four   novels. “Every country has had its great men,” wrote her niece Caroline, “Such a one was my Aunt. ” She was actually doing her best to talk up Austen’s achievements, but lacked the language with which to do so. “Great” writers were so obviously supposed to be male, and not anyone’s aunt. Many of Austen’s stories  —   and some of her very earliest are on display at the British Library  —   were first written for family members, to be read aloud during quiet country evenings in the various parsonages, cottages and, in a few lucky cases, the mansions in which the extended Austen clan lived. Until she published her books, Austen had no income apart from pocket money from her father or brothers. “Her whole world was her family,” explains Sandra Tuppen, the exhibition’s curator. “They gave her stability to write, she was reliant on them for money. ” But with that came a sense of obligation. The exhibition contains a watercolour of Godmersham Park, her wealthy brother Edward’s mansion in Kent, where Jane spent long periods as the poor relation relied upon for cheap childcare. Once you know this, you understand how Austen the novelist used her   perspective to skewer the vanities of the genteel world. George Austen, Jane’s father, looms large in the exhibition. First, there’s the mahogany writing desk he bought her for her 19th birthday, which folds up into a neat, lockable box for travel. It represents a vote of confidence from the man who would act as her first, if unsuccessful, literary agent. One of the British Library’s treasures today, the desk’s drawers would have concealed the drafts of Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice. George also purchased the notebooks in which Jane wrote out the uproarious and wicked short stories of her adolescence and teens. The notebook called “Volume the Second” contains Jane’s own handwritten version, for example, of “The Beautiful Cassandra”. The heroine falls in love, but not with a bewitching young viscount. The object of her desire is a bonnet. She steals it from a shop, before going to a confectioner’s where she “devoured six ices, refused to pay for them, knocked down the Pastry Cook and walked away”. Cassandra’s riotous adventures take place in 12 short chapters, each a sentence long: another joke was that this “novel” contained only 350 words. The three of Jane’s notebooks containing her teenage writings have been reunited by the British Library for the first time in 40 years. But then there’s a letter from Jane to her brother Frank, telling him of their father’s death in Bath. His decease plunged his widow and daughters into financial crisis, for with George’s death their income simply stopped. From then on Jane had to live upon the charity of her brothers. “It’s a difficult society in which to be a woman,” explains Tuppen. “At one point, Jane has to stay in Kent for two months because there’s no one free among her brothers to ‘bring’ her home again. ” It was not respectable to travel in a public stagecoach alone. Frank was Jane’s benefactor, but also her controller. Every word written by Austen was published long ago, so what is there to gain from seeing the real thing? The paper, the pens, the handwriting are all important, according to Tuppen. “The kinds of book she had to write in affected how her stories grew,” she says, pointing out that all the exhibits are small, no sheet of paper wider than a handspan. Paper was expensive Austen had to use it carefully. “You also get a sense of her as a human being, quick thinking, very witty,” Tuppen continues, pointing out one letter where she has flipped the paper to squeeze more words in  . The exhibition closes with the last of Austen’s surviving letters, dating from just a few weeks before she died. Her hand, formerly so neat, has now become a scrawl. Poignantly, Jane reassures her nephew that she’s going to get well soon. “I am gaining strength very fast,” she claims. “I am now out of bed from 9 in the morning to 10 at night   Upon the Sopha t’is true. ” Within two months she would be dead, possibly from Hodgkin’s lymphoma, to be buried in Winchester Cathedral under a memorial that famously neglects even to mention her books. Austen often took her writing desk with her from her native Hampshire to London, where she negotiated her publishing deals. Once the British Library exhibition closes, the desk itself will be moved on to Oxford to appear from 23 June in the Bodleian Library’s Which Jane Austen? exhibition. Rather than turning inward on her family, this exhibition will look at her wider world, examining her role as a professional writer in an age of war and the clashing of empires. “She lived in turbulent times,” says Kathryn Sutherland, an Austen scholar and the curator of the Bodeleian show, who beleives Austen was “our first novelist to describe the effect of war on the home front”. That second notebook of early stories also has another journey planned: after London, it will appear from 13 May in The Mysterious Miss Austen at Winchester Discovery Centre. The book also contains Austen’s version of a Horrible Histories style parody of a pompous history textbook. Jane’s elder sister and closest confidante Cassandra illustrated it, and may have asked Jane to sit for the portrait of her favourite historical figure, Mary, Queen of Scots. You’ll be able to make up your own mind if you think the sitter is really her or not, as the exhibition focuses on the vexed issue of Austen’s physical appearance. It is “not the usual reverential fare,” says its curator Louise West, who wants the anniversary celebrations to be both “highbrow, and lowbrow”. Winchester will be the place to go to see the five   possible portraits of Jane Austen, each with its own supporters and detractors, gathered together for the first time. While Janeites are pleased that she’s going to be on the banknote, many of them feel the intense irony that the image chosen by the Bank of England is a prettified, fictional author portrait produced well after her death. One of Austen’s nieces described the image as a “pleasing, sweet face” yet confessed to “not thinking it much like the original”. Although all these anniversary exhibitions will attempt to reveal her to the world, it’s oddly appropriate that we don’t know quite what Austen looked like. “Seldom, very seldom,” she herself warns us, “does complete truth belong to any human disclosure seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised. ” This most mysterious of authors always holds something back  —   and so continues to intrigue.  • Lucy Worsley’s book Jane Austen at Home will be published by Hodder in May. •This article was amended on 5 May 2017. An earlier version said that Austen’s desk would be displayed in the Bodleian Library’s Which Jane Austen? exhibition from 22 June, when in fact the exhibition is opening on the 23 June.": "149509",
    "Rodale Inc, a privately held media company known for publishing magazines such as Men’s Health and Runner’s World said on Wednesday that its board of directors had decided to explore strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of the company. Rodale is the latest publishing company trying to figure out its future in an online world where readers’ tastes have shifted away from print, leading to advertising declines across the industry. Most large media conglomerates have hived off their print businesses. Time Inc ( ) the publicly traded publisher of Time and Sports Illustrated magazines, ended a strategic review in April after talks with another publisher Meredith Corp ( ) broke off. Chief Executive Maria Rodale said in a statement that ”we are excited to explore opportunities for potential buyers of our business,” that can build on its brands.  Rodale said it is reviewing a sale of the entire business as well as some of its units. It could also decide not to sell, it said. A source familiar with the process who did not want to be named said the company would reach out to a wide range of buyers including other media companies and private equity firms.  Rodale’s valuation could not be learned and it does not disclose any financials. It said its brands reach 100 million people globally. Founded in 1942 in Emmaus, Pennsylvania, the family controlled company focuses on magazines and books that are focused on health and fitness such as Prevention and Bicycling magazine. It has also published books by celebrities such as Jessica Alba and Alicia Silverstone.

    "U. S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter says the military is lifting a ban on transgender service members. ”Effective immediately, transgender Americans may serve openly, and they can no longer be discharged or otherwise separated from the military just for being transgender,” he told reporters today at the Pentagon. The fundamental reason for the change, Carter said, is ”that the Defense Department and the military need to avail ourselves of all talent possible in order to remain what we are now  —   the finest fighting force the world has ever known.” Researchers at RAND, he explained, estimate that ”about 25, 000 people out of approximately 825, 000 reserve servicemembers are transgender, with the upper end of their range of estimates of around 7, 000 in the active component and 4, 000 in the reserves.” As NPR’s David Greene said on Morning Edition before the policy change was announced, trans troops have been ”caught in limbo.” He noted that trans troops haven’t been eligible for promotion and their colleagues were required to refer to them by their gender assigned at birth. People who transitioned before trying to enlist were considered unfit for service.” Before this change, trans troops had to seek medical care outside the military system and pay for it themselves. Part of the reason for today’s change is to provide ”better guidance” for commanders about ”how to handle questions such as deployment, medical treatment and other matters,” Carter said. He also called this ”a matter of principle. Americans who want to serve and can meet our standards should be afforded the opportunity to compete to do so.” Carter quoted Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark A. Milley when he said this decision has its roots in upholding the Constitution: ”The United States Army is open to all Americans who meet the standard, regardless of who they are. Embedded within our Constitution is that very principle, that all Americans are free and equal. And we as an Army are sworn to protect and defend that very principle. And we are sworn to even die for that principle. So if we in uniform are willing to die for that principle, then we in uniform should be willing to live by that principle.” Last July, the military started studying the practical issues for making this change and develop a plan to implement it. Research carried out by RAND, Carter explained, found that allowing trans troops to serve openly would have ”minimal readiness impacts” on the military. The implementation of this decision will start immediately and take place over the next year. Carter laid out a timeline: ”Today, we join in celebration with the thousands of brave transgender patriots who will now be able to serve our nation openly and with the deep respect they deserve,” Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin said in a statement. He adds: ”Ending this discriminatory policy not only brings   recognition to transgender service members, it also strengthens our military and our nation.” NPR’s Steve Inskeep spoke with Captain Jennifer Peace, who is transgender before the decision was released. She said it would determine her future in the military. Here’s more from Peace: ”Once the military makes this change, I don’t think it will be any more difficult to be in the military than it would be out. And in some ways I think that allowing trans people to serve is going to make it so much for better for them in some ways than outside the military because you don’t have to worry as much, now you’re going to be federally protected from discrimination. You’re going to be given access to health care  —   a lot of things that people on the outside still struggle with. ”So there are challenges to being in the military, and with the ban there have been challenges to being trans in the military because of the policies that have been in place. But once those bans are lifted, I don’t see any additional challenges of serving in the military than anywhere else.” Listen to the full interview with Peace here:": "170374",
    "SEOUL, South Korea  —   It was supposed to be an enormous  —   but quick  —   recall. Samsung Electronics of South Korea said two weeks ago that it would recall 2. 5 million units of its new   smartphone, the Galaxy Note 7, just days after some customers said their phones had caught fire. The recall is the largest in the history of the smartphone industry, but it also won Samsung praise from some in the mobile industry for the company’s speed and decisiveness. Today, the recall looks anything but smooth. Safety regulators in the United States have issued warnings in recent days cautioning consumers not to turn on their Note 7s on airplanes  —   and not to use their phones at all. South Korea’s flight regulator, in a reversal, followed suit, as have others around the world. The constant reminders of potential combustibility have further dented Samsung’s reputation and shaved as much as $14 billion off its market value, just when it looked to be gaining ground on Apple, its longtime rival, with its new line of sleek Galaxy smartphones. They also raise questions about whether Samsung’s rush to take back the phones created more problems. Experts say it led to a   effort that confused customers, frustrated regulators and continued to generate headlines both in the United States and at home. Data from the mobile analytics firm Apteligent showed that while Samsung’s recall appeared to have stopped new sales of the phone, a majority of people who had the affected phones were continuing to use them. “I thought, ‘How is it that this is happening?’ ” said Jennifer Shecter, a spokeswoman for the nonprofit consumer advocacy group Consumer Reports. She said the group found an inconsistent response to the recall across America, with some stores and carriers still selling the phones days after Samsung’s announcement. “Samsung made an announcement, but the government wasn’t involved, there wasn’t a clear message, there wasn’t an approved remedy and there wasn’t a clear fix,” she said. A Samsung spokeswoman declined to comment on its discussions with regulators, pointing only to a company statement that said it was working with the Consumer Product Safety Commission in the United States. On Thursday, the commission said it was issuing a formal recall of about one million Galaxy Note 7s sold before Sept. 15, urging people to contact their wireless carriers or to call Samsung for help. The recall is an embarrassing comedown for Samsung, an icon of South Korean innovation that accounts for   of the country’s exports. Its importance can lead to deference from regulators, experts say. South Korea’s flight regulator recommended last week that airline passengers not use or charge their Note 7 phones on flights only after the United States Federal Aviation Administration made the same recommendation. Flight regulators in Europe, Japan, India and elsewhere have issued similar notices. The situation is “regrettable,” said Kang   deputy director of the flight standards division of South Korean Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. He said the ministry initially had not acted because Samsung told it that the risks were manageable. But when the United States made its recommendation, South Korea had no choice but to follow, Mr. Kang said. “As the authority in the country with the company that made the product, the ministry felt concerned about the repercussions, should it be the first to ban the gadget on airplanes,” he said. Samsung confirmed that company representatives had met with the ministry but declined to comment further. Korean consumer safety regulators say the company’s effort had complied with South Korean law, and Samsung has taken additional steps in recent days to minimize the damage. This week it issued a software update that would keep the Note 7 from fully charging, reducing the risk of overheating. It has also bought advertising in American and South Korean media. Samsung has not given specifics about how many affected phones are in which markets, but many of the phones were most likely sold in critical markets where the company ships phones first, like the United States, South Korea and European countries such as Britain.  In the United States, the C. P. S. C. requires companies to notify it of defects and to coordinate public notification of recalls. The commission also asks the companies to work with it to determine how to notify customers and coordinate how the defective products can be replaced or returned. But when Samsung said on Sept. 2 that it would replace 2. 5 million Note 7s, it issued a news release by itself. It set up its own website telling Note 7 users to go back to where they had bought the phones or to contact its call center. In a Sept. 9 statement, the C. P. S. C. warned consumers not to use the phones at all. On Thursday, when the agency issued the formal recall, it said people should replace their Galaxy Note 7s with new ones that have a different battery or get a refund. At a news conference, the commission’s chairman, Elliot F. Kaye, hinted at the regulator’s dissatisfaction with Samsung. “I will say as a general matter that it’s not a recipe for a successful recall for a company to go out on its own,” he said, adding that companies that think they can successfully carry out a recall without coordinating with the government “need to have more than their phone checked. ” Samsung said replacement devices would be available in the United States no later than Sept. 21. In Hong Kong, Samsung initially told consumers they would not be affected because the models there used a different battery. A day later, it said about 500 would be affected after all. Experts say Samsung’s desire to deal with the problem quickly may have created confusion. Kim Jinbaek, a professor at the School of Business at   University in Seoul and a former Samsung employee, cited the example of Toyota Motor in Japan, which was criticized beginning in 2009 for dragging its heels in what turned out to be a major safety recall. At the time, Mr. Kim said, Toyota was in discussions with American safety regulators. “Samsung, on the other hand, decided not to wait through such coordination,” he said. Adding to the confusion, Samsung in its initial statement said it would replace the phones, avoiding use of the more damaging word “recall. ” Samsung also did not advise users to stop using the phones altogether until Sept. 10. Samsung’s own employees called on the company in an internal electronic bulletin board to act swiftly, according to local media reports that were confirmed by the company. The service allows employees to post messages anonymously. “We want you to make the best decision so we don’t feel ashamed before our customers who use the Galaxy phablet smartphones,” one posting said, using a word for big phones like the Note 7 that approach the size of a tablet. “The company owes much to the customers who preordered our phones or purchased them,” read another. “Our future lies in how well we treat these loyal customers. ”": "21719",
    "The   fight between Apple and the government burst into the open last week when the U. S. Federal Bureau of Investigation obtained a court order requiring Apple to write new software and take other measures to disable passcode protection and allow access to shooter Rizwan Farook’s iPhone. The clash has driven to the heart of a   debate over how much law enforcement and intelligence officials should be able to monitor digital communications. Arguing that the court should throw out the order that it issued last week, Apple said in its brief on Thursday that software was a form of protected speech, and thus the Justice Department’s demand violated the constitution. ”The government’s request here creates an unprecedented burden on Apple and violates Apple’s First Amendment rights against compelled speech,” it said. Apple also contended that the court was   its jurisdiction, noting that Congress had rejected legislation that would have required companies to do the things the government is asking Apple to do in this case. ”No court has ever authorized what the government now seeks, no law supports such unlimited and sweeping use of the judicial process, and the Constitution forbids it,” Apple said in its filing. The government argues that the All Writs Act, a broad 1789 law which enables judges to require actions necessary to enforce their own orders, compels Apple to comply with its request.  But Apple argued in its filing that prosecutors wrongly applied a key U. S. Supreme Court case, which involved a telephone company, to the San Bernardino situation. Since Apple is not a utility, and because Congress declined to force companies like Apple to build ”backdoors” into their products, Apple said it should not be forced to help the government hack into the San Bernardino iPhone. The Justice Department won the order from the federal court in Riverside, California last week, without the company present. The judge allowed Apple to respond in the brief on Thursday, and a hearing is scheduled for next month.     Some of the largest tech companies appear to be lining up behind Apple. Google and Facebook will both file briefs supporting the iPhone maker, said several sources familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly about it. Microsoft will file a     brief as well, company President Brad Smith said in congressional testimony Thursday. Twitter also said it will sign a brief in support of Apple. In a statement responding to Apple’s filing, the Justice Department said its approach to prosecuting crimes has not changed. ”The change has come in Apple’s recent decision to reverse its   cooperation in complying with All Writs Act orders,” department spokesperson Melanie Newman said. While much of Apple’s argument is that the All Writs Act does not apply, the free speech and due process claims could prove helpful if the company wants to attract the attention of the Supreme Court, said Jill Bronfman, director of the Privacy and Technology Project at University of California Hastings College of the Law. ”It always does help to mention the Constitution,” she said.  If the San Bernardino order is upheld, Apple said, it could leave individuals and business vulnerable to an unlimited array of government directives. ”Under the same legal theories advocated by the government here, the government could argue that it should be permitted to force citizens to do all manner of things ’necessary’ to assist it in enforcing the laws,” Apple said. It gave examples, ”like compelling a pharmaceutical company against its will to produce drugs needed to carry out a lethal injection in furtherance of a lawfully issued death warrant or requiring a journalist to plant a false story in order to help lure out a fugitive.” Apple also laid out the resources it believes would be necessary to comply with the government’s request, saying it would likely require a team of up to 10 Apple engineers and employees for as long as four weeks. Complying with the request would also likely lead to ”hundreds” of more demands from law enforcement, Apple said.  ”Responding to these demands would effectively require Apple to create   positions in a new ’hacking’ department to service government requests,” the company said in the filing. Earlier on Thursday, FBI Director James Comey told a congressional panel that court approval of the FBI’s request was ”unlikely to be a trailblazer” in other cases. While the case ”will be instructive for other courts,” larger policy questions about reasonable law enforcement access to encrypted data will likely need to be resolved by Congress and others, Comey said. Shares of Apple were barely changed and closed up less than 1 percent at $96. 76. Apple also raised the specter of courts ordering it to help in other cases in other ways, such as writing computer code that would turn on an iPhone microphone to help surveillance. The company also criticized the Justice Department for publicizing the order, which would normally have been filed under seal. ”This is the only case in counsel’s memory in which an FBI Director has blogged in   about pending litigation, suggesting that the government does not believe the data on the phone will yield critical evidence about other suspects,” the company said. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an interview on Wednesday with ABC News that the company was prepared to take the case to the Supreme Court if necessary. BRUSSELS EU antitrust regulators are weighing another record fine against Google over its Android mobile operating system and have set up a panel of experts to give a second opinion on the case, two people familiar with the matter said. KIEV The Ukrainian software firm used to launch last week’s global cyber attack warned on Wednesday that all computers sharing a network with its infected accounting software had been compromised by hackers.": "186685",
    "(CNN) Dream Team! That’s what I call this year’s Women’s Olympic Gymnastics Team and for more reasons than one.  First, I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.  And second: This team features three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren ”Laurie” Hernandez, who have been inspiring so many young girls of color.  The   of this team, rounded out by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, is making everyone proud.   This team looks, finally, like America. It also has solidified the black and Latina female presence at the top of this sport. For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been  . Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2. This is powerful. Last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America cheered. Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of   World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez delivering the unexpected, yet masterful gymnastics routines.    Last Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in the women’s individual   event. And teammate Aly Raisman earned silver. And this week Simone’s floor routine won her a fourth gold medal in Rio Raisman took the silver. We are witnessing the top of the sport, but it does not look like this at gymnastics classes across the country. Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team. (They are the ”Final Five” because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is Marta Karolyi’s last year coaching.) But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on.  Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business. These clubs are where the gymnasts get all of their training, and it’s a costly and   commitment for the gymnasts’ families.  Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started in gymnastics. We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie. I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.  At my organizations, we have provided free and   gymnastics, based in Harlem, for over 15, 000 urban youth (primarily black and Hispanic) and have trained national and international champions. In September, we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.  Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work, discipline and determination for the mind. This combination provides   benefits for good health, success in school and work. It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls to take gymnastics and that is great. To participate in sport is so important, especially for girls.  Here’s the research. And here, too. This is such an exciting time.  Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for that serious showcase of ”Girl Power” in winning the Olympic team gold and for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to begin their path to be healthy, strong and successful young women.": "56932",
    "Nearly everything you have been told about the food you eat and the exercise you do and their effects on your health should be met with a raised eyebrow. Dozens of studies are publicized every week. But those studies hardly slake people’s thirst for answers to questions about how to eat or how much to exercise. Does exercise help you maintain your memory? What kind? Walking? Intense exercise? Does eating carbohydrates make you fat? Can you prevent breast cancer by exercising when you are young? Do vegetables protect you from heart disease? The problem is one of signal to noise. You can’t discern the signal  —   a lower risk of dementia, or a longer life, or less obesity, or less cancer  —   because the noise, the enormous uncertainty in the measurement of such things as how much you exercise or what exactly you eat, is overwhelming. The signal is often weak, meaning if there is an effect of lifestyle it is minuscule, nothing like the link between smoking and lung cancer, for example. And there is no gold standard of measurement, nothing that everyone agrees on and uses to measure aspects of lifestyle. The result is a large body of studies whose conclusions are not reproducible. “We don’t know how to measure diet or exercise,” said Dr. Barnett Kramer, director of the National Cancer Institute’s division of disease prevention. His division is working on ways to sort out inconsistencies in research used to generate health advice, hoping to improve what has become a real mess: “You can ask people how many times a week or how many times a month they eat bread or berries or ask them to keep a diary of what they ate in the last 24 hours. ” But, he said, it should be no surprise that people misremember or give researchers an answer they think makes them sound good. “I can’t remember what meals I ate a week ago,” Dr. Kramer said. “Now ask me what meals I had as an adolescent, or how much I exercised. ” David Allison, director of the nutrition obesity research center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, says the same problems plague obesity research, with only two things known with certainty. All other things being equal, if you eat more calories, you will gain weight. And all other things being equal, if you exercise enough, you will lose a small amount of weight. Adding to the confusion is a cacophony of poorly designed research, the tendency for different researchers studying the same effect to use different measurements and report outcomes differently, and researchers’ tendency to selectively report positive or “interesting” results. The result is what Dr. Kramer calls whipsaw literature. “One week drinking coffee is good for you, and the next week it is lethal,” he says. The situation is so bad that what gets published tends to be what the scientists believe ahead of time, says Dr. John Ioannidis, a professor of medicine and of health research and policy at Stanford University’s medical school. “There are so many nutrients and so many diets,” he said. “So many outcomes  —   heart disease, cancer, stroke. What kind of data do you collect? A   at two months, six months, two years, 10 years? You end up having millions of choices. ” And the scientists get to pick the one they want. “I can get you any result you want in any observational data set,” he said. There have been rigorous lifestyle studies, but they are few and far between. A large diet study in Spain found that a Mediterranean diet, with fruits, vegetables, fish and olive oil or nuts, decreased the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Two large federal studies looked at a   diet but failed to find evidence it protects against colon cancer. Then there are the seemingly contradictory but   studies. One large federal study found that  —   contrary to all assumptions  —   diet and weight loss did not prevent heart attacks and strokes in people with Type 2 diabetes. Another large federal study found that people at risk for Type 2 diabetes could stave it off by losing a modest amount of weight and exercising. A few years ago, two researchers decided to ask just how crazy the cancer and diet literature was. They began with a cookbook, “The Boston   Cookbook,” and randomly selected recipes, listing the ingredients, until they had 50 distinct ingredients. Then they did a literature search asking if those ingredients were associated with cancer. Four out of five were linked to cancer, the researchers reported, either increasing or decreasing the risk. Often the same ingredient that increased risk in one study decreased it in another. Those ingredients not associated with cancer risk tended to be odd, like terrapin, and had not been studied by nutrition researchers. But when the authors, Dr. Jonathan Schoenfeld, a radiation oncologist at the   Cancer Institute, and Dr. Ioannidis, looked at   of the ingredients, which combined data from all the studies, the effects generally went away. They titled their paper, “Is everything we eat associated with cancer?” That study is no surprise to a group that puts together an authoritative guide, the Physicians Data Query, for the National Cancer Institute. The group’s screening and prevention board wants to make some sort of statement about whether diet affects cancer risk. But the studies are just so unreliable that it is hard to draw conclusions. The board’s feelings about whether diet has any link to cancer “are pretty consistently negative,” said Dr. Donald Berry, a biostatistician at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who is a member of the board. “Were I to write a paper on the subject, I might use this variant of their title: ‘Is anything we eat associated with cancer? ’” Dr. Berry said. “And my answer would be ‘No. The preponderance of the evidence is either negative or unreliable and subject to   conclusions. ’” Some medical experts say the problems with lifestyle studies are so overwhelming  —   and the chance of finding anything reproducible and meaningful so small  —   that it might be best to just give up on those questions altogether. “They may not be worth studying,” said Dr. Vinay Prasad, a cancer researcher at Oregon Health and Science University. “People want certainty, but, boy, we have no good answers. ” As for Dr. Kramer, he has not given up on rigorous research. What is needed at this point, he says, is a little more humility among researchers in interpreting and reporting the implications of their own evidence.": "23716",
    "’s 2016 word of the year might be fascism. For betting types making early 2017 predictions, “white nationalism” would not be a bad guess. Along with “white supremacy” and the newer phrase “alternative right,” or   it’s been a   fixture of news and accompanying battles over politics, racism, and language.     It started in earnest when it was announced that former Breitbart News editor Steve Bannon would serve as   Donald Trump’s administrative adviser. White nationalists like   writer and publisher Andrew Anglin rejoiced. Ken Reed, the national director of the   group Aryan Renaissance Society, celebrated in a Facebook post that read, “Can you say WINNING boys and girls? ??” using the hashtags #WhiteLivesMatter and #AltRight.  The     made even more headlines when the white supremacist National Policy Institute held an   conference in Washington, DC, the weekend after the election. There, the group’s leader, Richard Spencer, delivered remarks calling America “a white country designed for ourselves and our posterity. ” In a video shared by the Atlantic, Trump’s victory and Spencer’s statements were cheered by the crowd with Nazi salutes and chants of, “Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!”  Yes, actual Nazi salutes. In a DC hotel. By people who felt Trump’s election and appointments were their victory.     Along with the horror over this came complaints that   activists were being referred to in many headlines with their chosen,   title, rather than something that made their racist agenda plain. Before long, the Associated Press and the New York Times issued strong guidance to their writers regarding the term. In both cases, they said uses of the  ’s preferred label must be accompanied by an explanation to readers about what defines the group: the racism, misogyny, and white supremacy that characterize it.     These news organizations’ memos have been clear mandates in a contentious, evolving public debate about how to characterize the groups and individuals who have been emboldened and empowered by Trump’s win and share one scary thing: an obsession with white power, influence, and identity.  At a time when unabashed racists are elated at the possibility that the   will take action to create the “white country” of their fantasies, and people who share their policy views but have no hate group affiliation are being empowered, the current battle of words is an important one. Fueling it is the risk that the wrong language choices could cloud Americans’ understanding of what’s actually happening. Complicating things is the sobering reality that the threats nonwhite people face don’t change depending on what we call the people responsible for them.      Why there are suddenly fights over how to describe racist views and groups  —   and why they have fresh relevance Unless you work for an organization like the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks the activity of hate groups, or are a scholar of critical race studies, “white supremacy” and “white nationalism” aren’t likely part of your daily vocabulary. Or at least they weren’t until Trump’s bold expressions of racism and xenophobia  —   and hints that he’d support policies that reflect these concepts  —   began to inspire groups that embrace these ideas, making them newly relevant. Just as people debate when and where the term “racist” can be fairly applied (hint: nowhere, without plenty of people protesting) it’s becoming obvious there won’t be easy agreement on who and what deserve these other labels. Even people who appear to be white supremacy’s proud poster children reject the label.  Hints of this battle over words first surfaced during the campaign season, when Trump received the endorsement of former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke  —   just one of the white nationalists and white supremacists who were elated and energized by Trump’s campaign. In fact, Mother Jones’s Josh Harkinson reported on the white extremist movements that hoped to capitalize on Trump’s victory. The week before the election, the front page of the KKK’s official newspaper displayed a raving embrace of his “Make America Great Again” message. Candidate Trump denounced the support of both Duke and the Klan, in a clear distancing from the negative associations with white supremacy.      But soon after Trump was declared the winner of the election, he appointed Bannon to be an administration adviser. Extremists like Anglin, the   writer, and commenters on his Daily Stormer post who celebrated Bannon’s reported   were pleased.  But there was a twist: Bannon insisted he was not a white nationalist but rather an “economic nationalist. ” Trump went even further, telling the New York Times that Bannon was neither racist nor “ . ” Another tug of war over labels followed when Spencer made it known that he wasn’t fond of the terms “racist,” “Nazi,” and “white supremacist” being applied to him. Instead, Spencer, who led the “Hail Trump!” Nazi salute and heads a group that promotes “America for white people,” told the Washington Post he prefers to be called an “identitarian”  —   a reference to a movement that has more momentum in Europe but all the same associations with racism and xenophobia.  In an effort to stop people like Spencer from allowing   labels to distract from their shocking (and, to people of color, deeply threatening) beliefs and goals, some   publications have announced that they’ll reject the “ ” term altogether. On November 27, ThinkProgress editors announced that people in this movement would not be labeled with their chosen descriptors but rather would be called “white nationalists” or “white supremacists. ”   Yet that same week, Mother Jones’s Kevin Drum urged progressives to go in the opposite direction: pulling back the use of the phrase “white supremacy,” which he dubbed a “fad,” as liberals use it “with more abandon than we should. ” Instead, he advised that the term should be reserved for people and institutions that “really deserve it,” and use “racist” in its place: “If something is racist,” he wrote, “then call it racist. ” Confused? You’re not alone. In this scramble to define and regulate the use of terminology in a new landscape of open calls for white power, the competing personal, political, journalistic, and ideological interests have created a kind of chaos.     The single thing everyone seems to agree on is that words matter  —   a lot.  White supremacy, white nationalism, and the  : Here’s what these terms mean and where they overlap  Let’s start with the broadest term, white supremacy, and its adjective form, “white supremacist. ” It has a powerful ring to it  —   probably because, unlike “” it creates associations with terrorist racist organizations that the majority of Americans have been taught to recognize as objectively bad.  Perhaps that’s why Drum argued that it should be used with caution and reserved for “actual   and a few others. ” Crystal Fleming, a sociology professor at Stony Brook University, says Drum’s proposed “  and a few others” standard is misguided, but not uncommon.  “It’s pretty easy to explain,” she told Vox. “The reality is that when folks hear the term ‘white supremacy’  —   the layperson and even the average scholar  —   they tend to think of the KKK. ”  That’s not what it means, she explained. The key difference is between “white supremacy” and “white supremacist. ” The latter refers to people who embrace the ideology of white superiority, but white supremacy  is more general: It simply describes “the sociopolitical dominance of people socially defined as white,” Fleming said.    In her view  —   and the view of critical race scholars  —   “white supremacy” just refers to the way people defined as white (which has shifted throughout the course of America’s history) have been allowed to have, and systematically have been given access to, more resources, whether those are political, economic, social, or all of the above.  In other words, she says it’s not an outrageous, overused slur but instead “a constant throughout history. ” If you have any doubts about that, consider Richard Spencer’s description of America again: “A white country designed for ourselves and our posterity. ” That’s basically, Fleming’s definition of white supremacy in different words. Given that a white supremacist and a black sociologist agree that the concept of white supremacy is foundational to America  —   and the former is working to make that more so  —   now would seem like an especially   time to pull back on using the phrase.  The next thing to understand is the relationship between white supremacists and white nationalists. While listing the words it will use while announcing recently that it would abandon the term “” ThinkProgress offered a distinction between the two: “White nationalist” refers to a specific ideology held by many of those who adopt the “ ” label. A white nationalist is someone who believes the United States should be governed by and for white people, and that national policy should radically advance white interests. White supremacists are a broader and more inchoate group, comprised of those who believe in the innate superiority of white people.  Sophie   a postdoctoral anthropology fellow at Vanderbilt University who studies contemporary white supremacist movements, distinguishes these groups of people similarly. Within white nationalism, a lot of people also have a specific goal: a white  . They’d contrast this with the ultimate aims of white supremacists, who want to have power over people of color within the same state, she told Vox.     Finally, the phrase that’s been the topic of the most debate  —   “ ”  —   is the name Spencer gave to a loose,   group linked by racist ideas about “white identity” and the preservation of “Western civilization” when he launched his Alternative Right blog in 2010 (more on this group’s beliefs later).  Finally, there’s “ . ” ThinkProgress’s editors also said the term can apply to any of these groups “when they identify as such, or adopt important aspects of Nazi rhetoric and iconography. ” According to   the National Policy Institute’s recent “hail Trump salute” incident isn’t the only reason many think the term “ ” is a good fit for the group. Like white nationalists as a whole, “many members of the     have decided that targeting Jews and ratcheting up   language is a strategy,” she said.  There’s a strong case that the phrase “ ” is the sneaky, dangerous rebranding work of white nationalists The label “ ” may be considered the latest attempt to create distance from racist groups and terms like “white supremacy” or even specific groups like the KKK. Those names and labels come with weighty, negative histories that have been generally rejected as destructive and immoral.  “White supremacists started to be called white nationalists by groups born out of old white citizens’ councils that were fighting desegregation the South, as a way to make their position of whites being better than any other race more politically palatable,” Ryan Lenz, the editor of the SPLC’s Hatewatch blog, told Vox.  Eventually, he says, “white nationalist” developed its own negative baggage. And while mainstream acceptance of their views may have dwindled since the civil rights era, the commitment of people holding these views  —   many of whom discovered them on the internet  —   to seeing them become reality did not. Next thing you knew, the   was born.  “Richard Spencer coined the phrase ‘alternative right’  —   a phrase that is so innocuous and so   that it gives the idea that it is simply one alternative to conservatism,” Lenz says. “It is not. ”    According to the SPLC, the name is one key part of a package that includes neat dressing and a   appearance. (“We have to look good,” Spencer once told Salon’s Lauren Fox, explaining that no one would want to join a movement that appeared “crazed or ugly or vicious or just stupid. ”) And they’re not alone in the belief that it’s all a dangerous effort to rebrand vile ideas about racial superiority and separatism as a legitimate part of the political spectrum.  “I am very passionate about this idea that we need to be very careful with that term,”   told Vox. “‘ ’ sounds much more palatable than ‘ ’  —   it is an attempt at reframing a violent ideology as a palatable political position. ”  Former Breitbart editor Ben Shapiro told Vox’s Sean Illing in November that this branding is key to making the   appealing for the kind of people who are willing to support the group’s racist visions for the country once they’re in the door but would have hesitated to open that door if it said “white supremacy” in bold letters:  The next thing they have to do is obfuscate what the   actually is, so a lot of people think they’re   when they’re not. Rather than say the   is an explicitly white nationalist movement, they say, well, if you’re pissed off at the establishment, you’re probably  . If you’re somebody who lurks online, you’re probably  . If you don’t like Paul Ryan, if you think he’s soft, you’re probably  . And they trap a lot of people in this way. They also need what I call fellow travelers, people who are willing to nod and look the other way about the  ’s racism because they think the   is essentially correct about Western civilization being under assault. Someone like Pat Buchanan, for example, falls under this category.   ’s concern about the term “ ” is based on similar thinking: It creates the risk that more white people may become radicalized by the group. “If we help to normalize these ideas as just part of the political spectrum, then it can make it seem less radical than they are and less connected to racial violence  —   because if people espouse racist ideas and racial rhetoric, there’s always some kind of a correlation to racist violence,” she said. “And if we don’t describe them for what they are, we’re kind of giving other white people a path to think these are legitimate ideas and a chance that more white people will become radicalized in adopting these ideas. ” The nuanced difference between these groups matters to their members. To people of color who’d suffer under their agendas, not so much.  Most of the time, white nationalists don’t want to be called white supremacists. And many members of the   don’t want to be called white nationalists.     To be fair, they’re not being inaccurate when they point out that there are differences between the groups.  Vox’s Dylan Matthews’s   explainer on the   makes this clear. It was an incredibly detailed take on the diverse demographic, emotional, and philosophical ingredients that are baked into the   cake. Matthews outlined the group’s various factions  —   from libertarians to neoreactionaries to Gamergate guys  —   and quoted Milo Yiannopoulos, an   activist, saying that some   embrace racism for “shock value,” not because they’re actually bigots. With insider perspectives like this and many more, Matthews makes a compelling case that the group really is more than “  white supremacy” or “a simple rebranding of the white nationalist movement. ”  The New York Times’s Amanda Taub pointed out a similar distinction, explaining that what makes the   different from white nationalism is that many of its members’ first priorities and entrees into the group aren’t related to race. “The   is ideologically broader than white nationalism  —   it also includes neoreactionaries, monarchists, and   internet trolls,” she wrote.  So, yes, the   includes views and characters that fail to map perfectly onto say, your average KKK chapter.  But a key question is whether, and to whom, these differences matter.  The answer: Not at all, to people paying attention to the rising influence of racist hate in this country. Lenz told Vox that from his perch at the SPLC, “White supremacy, white nationalism, and the   are all the same thing. ”   similarly dismisses the distinctions between the three groups as “splitting hairs. ”     Why? Because for all intents and purposes, they share a vision for America. As Taub explained, “White supremacists and white nationalists both believe that racial discrimination should be incorporated into law and policy. ” And the   as a whole  —   whether we call its members white nationalists, white supremacists,   racists, the Gamergate gang, or some other new term  —   is quite clear that it’s enthusiastically behind this plan.  Ultimately, as Vox’s Zack Beauchamp reported, the  ’s hope for the  ’s influence is “reducing the numbers and influence of African Americans, Hispanics, Muslims, and Jews. ” Its members want Trump to follow through on the most extreme immigration ideas he’s discussed  —   such as deporting millions of undocumented immigrants and banning Muslim immigration. Their goal: slowing the “dispossession of America’s whites. ”  So while it may be true that there are variations (big ones, in some cases) in internal lives and personal identities among people who call themselves white supremacists, white nationalists, and members of the   it’s also true that these nuances mostly only matter to them  —   and perhaps to people taking a historic academic approach to understanding their individual textures. Meanwhile, for people concerned about their growing influence on American politics and increasing confidence  —   in particular for people of color who would be the victims of the policies they support  —   these differences have little to no practical significance.  Even the strongest argument the   makes for the case that it should be distinguished from white supremacists and white nationalists  —   that it doesn’t have a violent history  —   seems insincere in the eyes of experts. “They’ll seize upon this, arguing, ‘If you lump us in there with Klansmen, you’re trying to smear us by association,’” Lenz said.  But Stony Brook’s Fleming told Vox this indignation is for show, and that central to the  ’s attempt to mainstream white nationalism and racism is its tactic of going right up to the line of violence  —   but being careful not to explicitly endorse it. “There’s a lot of winking and denial,” she said. “They’re very astute with encouraging discrimination, violence, and bigotry but still hiding under the cover of, ‘We didn’t call for them to be lynched. ’” Not to mention that Spencer’s calls for peaceful rather than violent ethnic cleansing aren’t particularly reassuring or meaningful to the nonwhite and Jewish people who would stand to be eliminated from his ideal country. And you can read “not particularly” to mean “not at all. ”     “We have this movement from the KKK, which is a terrorist group in a multiracial society, to this new position of saying, ‘We just want to have a white ethnic state,’ but white supremacist ideas are clearly foundational to that,”   said. “Then [the  ] says the goal is not a race war, or violence, just a separate state. But the question is, in a multiracial state, how are you going to do that without violence?” Nobody knows the answer. One reason some are so insistent on slapping the “white supremacist” label on the    —   along with all the negative associations that come with it  —   is to make it less likely that we’ll ever have to find out.  You don’t have to wear a hood, do a Nazi salute, be an internet troll, or claim memberships in any of these groups to perpetuate racism and cause harm  With the increasing newsworthiness of these groups of people  —   white supremacists, white nationalists, and the    —   it’s important to remember that most people don’t have links to any of these groups, but many share their core beliefs.  “While few people identify as white nationalists, there is a continuum of views shared by many Americans that are explicitly hostile to people who aren’t     white Christians,” Omar Wasow, an assistant professor of political science at Princeton University, said. “In short, you don’t need to wear a white robe to feel, at a deep level, that America belongs to your community more than other citizens. ” Fleming added: “Organizations matter, but ideologies and practices I would argue matter more. Whether one is officially part of an org or not, you can look at folks’ records or statements and clearly see when they embrace policies that disadvantage or harm people of color. ”   says Trump’s attorney general pick, Sen. Jeff Sessions, is the perfect example: “There’s been all this attention to Bannon because of his work at Breitbart, but there’s also someone like Sessions who was deemed too racist 30 years ago to be a federal judge,” she said. “I haven’t seen anything that says he’s part of this movement [the  ] but at the same time it’s not like his potentially racist leanings are any less dangerous. ”    It’s no wonder Spencer told Mother Jones he was pleased with Sessions’s appointment, because labels don’t matter as much as ideas.  ”Jeff Sessions, again, is someone who is not   but who seems to see eye to eye with us on the immigration question. I think Jeff Sessions might very well resonate with something like a   dramatic slowdown of immigration,” he said. Spencer added, ”What he is not going to do in terms of federally prosecuting diversity and fair housing and so on I think is just as powerful as what he might do. So it’s about Jeff Sessions setting a new tone in Washington. I think that’s a good thing. ” In other words, someone who has no links to any racist organizations has still managed to be the politician of white supremacists’ dreams and the nightmares of people of color. Professional racists are emboldened, and those who aren’t associated with any group are in a position to make their racist goals seem realistic, SPLC’s Lenz says. “These are confusing and scary times. ” While there may not be much to do to calm these fears, insisting on precise language to describe them is a start.": "203592",
    "Members of a   gay group say they have been banned from participating in the Charlotte Pride Parade because of their support for President Trump. [Brian Talbert told WJZY that he and another gay Trump supporter of the group “Gays for Trump” applied to have their float featured in Charlotte’s Pride Parade this year but received an email from Charlotte Pride rejecting his application.  “We wanted to show that we weren’t the racist, bigot, misogynist whatevers. We wanted to show that we are Americans, love our country and our president. We wanted to be there to celebrate gay pride,” Talbert said. “For a group of people to claim to want tolerance, acceptance, and give it to every single person you can imagine to give it to, for them to sit back and judge me for exercising my right as an American to choose my leader without judgment is hypocritical,” he added. A Charlotte Pride spokesperson said they have a right to turn away groups that “do not reflect the mission, vision, and values of our organization. ” Talbert said he plans to sue Charlotte Pride for discrimination and is already raising money for his legal fees on a GoFundMe page. The campaign has raised $3, 100 as of Thursday afternoon.

    "Michigan has one of the largest Muslim populations of any state, yet 6 out of 10 Republicans in the state favored a temporary ban on Muslim visitors to the United States, according to early exit poll results from CNN. [The proposal  —   championed by Republican frontrunner Donald J. Trump  —   was even more popular in Mississippi, where 7 out of 10 Republicans favored a ban on Muslim travel. Those proportions match the range of responses among the states that voted a week ago on Tuesday, ranging from 64% (Virginia) to Alabama (78%).  The exit polls confirm recent public polling results, such as a WXYZ   Free Press poll that showed 61% support in Michigan for a ban on Muslims. Local Muslims in Michigan reacted with concern at the poll results. The exit poll results bode well for Trump, who is thought to be facing a fairly strong challenge in Michigan from Ohio Gov.

    ", I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. No great universities exist in the world without a deep institutional commitment to academic freedom, free inquiry, and free expression. For the past 60 years, American research universities have been vigilant against external and internal attempts to limit or destroy these values. The First Amendment scholar Geoffrey Stone has noted that free expression, in one form or another, has been continually under attack on campuses for the past 100 years. Today, these core university values are being questioned again, but from a new source: the students who are being educated at them. What explains this recent outcry against free expression on campus? Multiple possible explanations exist, of course, including the hypothesis that parents have coddled a generation of youngsters to the point where students feel that they should not be exposed to anything harmful to their psyches or beliefs. Whether or not these psychological narratives are valid, there are, I believe, additional cultural, institutional, and societal explanations for what is going on. And the overarching theme is that today’s youngsters, beginning in preschool, are responding to living in a contrived culture of fear and distrust. There’s hardly consensus among students on the forms or appropriateness of these restrictions on speech. Today, nearly half of a random sample of roughly 3, 000 college students surveyed by Gallup earlier this year are supportive of restrictions on certain forms of free speech on campus, and 69 percent support disciplinary action against either students or faculty members who use intentionally offensive language or commit “microagressions” —  speech they deem racist, sexist, or homophobic. According to a   survey conducted by Yale last year, of those who knew what trigger warnings are, 63 percent would favor their professors using them —  by attaching advisories to the books on their reading lists that might offend or disrespect some students, for example —  while only 23 percent would oppose. Counterintuitively, liberal students are more likely than conservative students to say the First Amendment is outdated. Consider a few recent cases: Brown University, Johns Hopkins University, Williams College, and Haverford College, among others schools, withdrew speaking invitations, including those for commencement addresses, because students objected to the views or political ideology of the invited speaker. Brandeis University began to monitor the class of a professor who had explained that Mexican immigrants to the United States are sometime called “wetbacks,” a comment about the history of a derogatory term that outraged some Mexican American students. Black students at Princeton University protested against the “racial climate on campus” and demanded that Woodrow Wilson’s name be removed from its school of Public and International Affairs. The chilling effect of these kind of restrictions on speech were not lost in 1947 on Robert Hutchins, the president of the University of Chicago, who opined during the McCarthy period: “The question is not how many professors have been fired for their beliefs, but how many think they might be. ” Born in the   seniors in my Columbia University undergraduate seminars today likely have not experienced major national threats, except for their vague memories of the   terrorist attacks. Yet these “millennials” might better be labeled “children of war and fear. ” During their politically conscious lifetime, they have known only a United States immersed in protracted wars against real and   terrorists, a place where fear itself influences their attitudes toward other civil liberties. Students are asked to pit freedom of expression or privacy against personal security. During times when elected officials have exploited the public’s fear of terrorism for political gain, students seem more willing to trade civil liberties for a sense of security. Since the   tragedy, the use of fear is still pervasive in the United States. Indeed, the distortion of fear pervades today’s students’ thinking —  they tend to overestimate, for example, the probability of a terrorist attack affecting them. When this fear is combined with the rapid expansion of social media and the prevalence of government surveillance, students often dismiss concepts like “privacy” as   values that are irrelevant to them, In fact, my experience at Columbia suggests that many students believe that the very idea of privacy is obsolete most of my students don’t seem to mind this loss when it’s weighed against uncovering potential terrorists. Add to this apprehension the fears that so many students of color experienced before college —  a rational fear of the police, of racial stereotypes, of continual exposure to epithets and prejudice —  and it is no wonder that they seek safe havens. They may have expected to find this safe haven in college, but instead they find prejudice, stereotyping, slurs, and phobic statements on the campuses as well. Additionally, many of these students employ the classification of “the insider. ” Believing that “outsiders” cannot possibly understand the situation that faces these groups of offended individuals, by virtual of race, gender, ethnicity, or some other category, the students often dismiss the views of their professors and administrators who can’t “get it” because they are not part of the oppressed group. Many of the young adults at highly selective colleges and universities have been forced to follow a straight and narrow path, never deviating from it because of a passion unrelated to school work, and have not been allowed, therefore, to live what many would consider a normal childhood —  to play, to learn by doing, to challenge their teachers, to make mistakes. Their families and their network of friends and social peers have placed extreme pressure on them to achieve, or win in a   game with their own friends. While it’s difficult to assess the cases, and while myriad factors likely contribute to the poor mental health among college students, in 2015 roughly 18 percent of undergraduates reported being diagnosed or treated for anxiety in the past year, according to the American College Health Association’s 2015 annual survey the rate was 15 percent for depression. Many are taking   and   medication upon entry into college. But there is a different, though equally important, reason many students today are willing to suppress free expression on campus. And the fault largely lies at the feet of many of the country’s academic leaders. Students and their families have been increasingly treated as “customers. ” Presidents of colleges and universities have been too reluctant to “offend” their customers, which may help explain why they so often yield to   demands by students. Courage at universities is, unfortunately, a rare commodity —  and it’s particularly rare among leaders of institutions pressured by students to act in a politically correct way. It seems that the vast majority of presidents and provosts of the finest U. S. universities have not seized this moment of concern voiced by students as a teaching moment —  a moment to instruct and discuss with students what college is about. Too many academic leaders are obsessed with the security of their own jobs and their desire to protect the reputation of their institution, and too few are sufficiently interested in making statements that may offend students but that show them why they are at these colleges —  and why free expression is a core and enabling value of any   institution that considers itself of the first rank. Of course, there are strong academic leaders who do encourage open discussions of issues raised by students while also speaking out against restrictions on campus speech, against speech codes,   psychology, and  . But they are too few and far between. Students want to be protected against slurs, epithets, and different opinions from their own —  protected from challenges to their prior beliefs and presuppositions. They fear not being respected because of a status that they occupy. But that is not what college is about. While some educators and policymakers see college primarily as a place where students develop skills for   jobs, the goal of a college education is for students to learn to think independently and skeptically and to learn how to make and defend their point of view. It is not to suppress ideas that they find opprobrious. Yet students are willing to trade off free expression for greater inclusion and the suppression of books or speech that offend —  even if this means that many topics of importance to their development never are openly discussed. Of all of America’s great universities, the University of Chicago seems to have come the closest historically to getting this right. The school’s   1967 Kalven Committee report was, I believe, correct when it stated: “The mission of the university is the discovery, improvement, and dissemination of knowledge. Its domain and scrutiny includes all aspects and all values of society. A university faithful to its mission will provide enduring challenges to social values, policies, practices, and institutions. By design and by effect, it is the institution which creates discontent with the existing social arrangements and proposes new ones. In brief, a good university, like Socrates, will be upsetting. ”  Almost 50 years later, at the request of its President Robert Zimmer, The University of Chicago again articulated its position on “freedom of expression. ” The short document quotes the historian and former Chicago president, Hanna Holborn Gray: “Education should not be intended to make people comfortable, it is made to make them think. Universities should be expected to provide the conditions within which hard thought, and therefore strong disagreement, independent judgment, and the questioning of stubborn assumptions, can flourish in an environment of the greatest freedom. ” “In a word,” the report goes on, “the University’s fundamental commitment is to the principle that debate or deliberation may not be suppressed because the ideas put forth are thought by some or even by most members of the University community to be offensive, unwise, immoral, or  . ” Yet students may be signaling that their commitment to “community” values may take precedence over this core value that many administrators have seen as essential for truly great institutions of learning. A physically safe environment is an absolutely necessary condition for heated debate over ideas. The university cannot tolerate violations of personal space, physical threats, sustained public interruptions of speakers, or verbal epithets directed toward specific students that lies beyond the boundaries of academic freedom. That doesn’t mean, however, that a college or university should introduce policies that will curtail or chill debate, that adhere to the politically correct beliefs of the moment, or that let their leaders off the hook through capitulation to “demands” that stifle discourse and conversations about what a university education aims to produce.": "77852",
    "Prices for “Hamilton”     are sky high on the secondary market, with fans coughing up more than $6, 000 a pop for tickets. “We’ve never seen anything like this,” said Chris Matcovich, a vice president with TiqIQ, an online ticket aggregator that connects avariety of sellers with buyers. “In terms of most expensive shows in Broadway history, nothing even comes close. ” As of Wednesday, the average secondary market ticket asking price for Miranda’s last show the night of July 9 was $4, 798. 97, with the lowest price to get in the door hovering around $2, 319. In comparison, the average asking price for all previous “Hamilton” performances was $1, 293. 99  —   73 percent lower than the for Miranda’s last show. The most expensive single ticket sold, so far, through TiqIQ for the 8 p. m. performance went for $6, 600  —   for an Orchestra seat, Matcovich said. But as far as a single purchase goes, the high so far is the $20, 800 that one person shelled out to buy four tickets nearby. “The fact that this last show is going for $5, 000 average price is incredible,” Matcovich said. “We’ve had Super Bowls where the average price is lower than that. ” Before “Hamilton” made the leap to the Great White Way last August, the title for most expensive show on Broadway was held by “The Book of Mormon,” which had a   price average of $469 in its first year. That’s chump change compared to the sales “Hamilton” was doing this past fall, when the average price for tickets skyrocketed from $297. 57 at the show’s inception in August to a whopping $1, 000 per ticket by October. The show has been nominated for a record 16 Tony Awards this year, including best musical and best original score, as well as with seven performance nominations for actors and actresses.

    "Donald Trump ended his journey to the American presidency the way he began it: by vowing to restore the borders of the United States. In launching his campaign a year and a half ago, Trump promised a wall to keep out Mexican immigrants and tariffs to keep out   cars. After taking his oath of office on Friday, Trump essentially announced what amounts to a dramatic break with decades of American foreign policy: The U. S. government will no longer focus on sustaining peace and prosperity beyond its borders. “A nation exists to serve its citizens,” not those of other countries, Trump declared. He issued a “new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power” —  that U. S. decisions related to trade, immigration, and foreign affairs would “be made to benefit American workers and American families. ” ’American Carnage’: The Trump Era Begins, “For many decades, we’ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry subsidized the armies of other countries, while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military,” Trump said. “We’ve defended other nations’ borders while refusing to defend our own. ” Many Republicans and Democrats support the things Trump is criticizing —  free trade, U. S. military alliances, the numerous other   aspects of globalization —  but not because they want to serve people in other countries more than their own people. Rather, it’s because they feel these things prevent major military conflicts and promote economic growth, openness, and interdependency in ways that ultimately benefit American workers and families. These benefits aren’t always apparent you don’t, for example, notice a world war that never happens. Trump, however, thinks these arguments are nonsense. He argues that America’s embrace of “globalism” has only stripped the country of its wealth, power, and ability to control its own affairs. As he once put it, the “  remains the true foundation of peace and harmony. ” In this way, Trump has emerged as the most prominent spokesman for a brand of nationalism that is gaining ground in many countries. Border walls and fences are going up around the world at an accelerating pace. Populist,   political parties are growing more popular in Europe as rates of immigration increase. “At least since Genghis Khan secured travel along the Silk Road, the flow of goods, money and people across borders has advanced and retreated in   waves,” Ruchir Sharma wrote this fall in The New York Times. “The retreat that began in 1914 continued for three decades, weakening the world economy and feeding the resentments that erupted into World War II. The retreat that began in 2008 is still gaining strength. ” In a recent study of how the concept of borders has changed over the last 500 years, the historian Charles Maier makes a critical distinction regarding territory that can be applied to Trump’s inaugural message. Territory is an “identity space,” he notes, providing a sense of belonging just like a person’s race or religion might. “Territory is still the emotional reference point for legal belonging,” Maier writes. But territory has also long served as a “decision space,” establishing the “reach of legislation and collective decisions” about “who belonged and who was foreign, how wealth would be generated and distributed, how the domain of the sacred must be honored, how families reproduced themselves. ” Globalization, Maier argues, has proven so disruptive and divisive because it has weakened decision space but not identity space. Nationalism remains strong, even as national leaders struggle to control what happens within their countries: Through the first three quarters of the twentieth century, excepting experiences of wartime or emigration, most adults in the West understood their decision space and their identity space to be congruent. The areas that claimed their loyalty also organized their labor, provided security, and ensured family continuity. Today these domains no longer coincide so pervasively. Territoriality seems less a resource for guaranteeing livelihoods, excluding foreigners, or maintaining coherence of values. It no longer provides the same capacity for control, even if territories remain the nexus of primary allegiance. Identity space and decision space have diverged. Globalization, Maier notes, has divided politicians into “globalists,” who “believe in and benefit from the new flows of capital and employment,” and “territorialists,” who “fear that their jobs and traditional values are being sacrificed. ” These camps cut across traditional party lines, which is scrambling the way politics works in many countries. Donald Trump, for example, favors policies of the “territorialist Left,” including the imposition of trade barriers to protect jobs, and policies of the “territorialist Right,” such as fortifying borders to prevent migration. On Friday, Trump called not just for the government to solely consider Americans when making its decisions, but also for Americans to display “total allegiance to the United States of America. ” In a sense, he called for America’s decision space and identity space to be reunited. In an era of globalization, that could bring about profound change.": "73620",
    "Trump ally Chris Ruddy has caused quite a stir over the past 24 hours. The CEO of the   website Newsmax, a close friend of Trump’s, has been making the media rounds saying President Trump is considering firing special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Department of Justice investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. ”I think he’s considering perhaps terminating the special counsel,” Ruddy told PBS NewsHour Monday night, though he went on to say he thinks, personally, it would be a bad idea. ”I think he’s weighing that option. I think it’s pretty clear by what one of his lawyers said on television recently. I personally think it would be a very significant mistake.” Why not, right? It’s believable enough. After all, Trump fired James Comey as FBI director. Trump reportedly told top Russian diplomats in the Oval Office that pressure is now taken off after firing Comey. And here’s that lawyer interview Ruddy was referring to: But firing Mueller would be a political bomb in Washington. Mueller, the former FBI director, is widely respected on both sides of the aisle, something that’s pretty tough to do in Washington nowadays. Both Democrats and Republicans pushed back. House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Adam Schiff,  . said the move would have the unintended consequence of keeping Mueller in charge: Sen. Lindsey Graham,  . C. said the move would be a ”disaster” and, he added, ”There’s no reason to fire Mueller. What’s he done to be fired?” Sen. Susan Collins,   said it would be ”extraordinarily unwise.” House Speaker Paul Ryan,  . said Tuesday he had confidence in Mueller and that he should be left alone to conduct an independent investigation, NPR’s Susan Davis reports. ”These investigations are important,” Ryan said. ”They need to be independent. The need to be thorough. They need to go where the facts go. But we also have a duty to serve the people that elected us to fix the problems that they are confronting in their daily lives and that’s what we’re doing.” House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy,  . accused the media of ”creating a rumor that’s not happening.” The White House forcefully disputed Ruddy’s claims, saying he speaks for himself, not the president. ”Mr. Ruddy never spoke to the president regarding this issue,” White House press secretary Sean Spicer said. ”With respect to this subject, only the president or his attorneys are authorized to comment.” Of course, neither of those statements is a denial that Trump is considering it. The move would be Nixonian. Trump himself does not have the authority to directly fire the special counsel. That would have to be done by the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, given that Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from DOJ’s Russia investigation. Both Rosenstein and Sessions are testifying Tuesday on Capitol Hill. Rosenstein was asked about it and answered this way, ”You have my assurance that Director Muller will have the full degree of independence that he needs to conduct the investigation.” He added, ”I’m not going to follow any order unless I believe those are lawful and appropriate orders. Under the regulation, Special Counsel Mueller may be fired only for good cause, and I am required to put that cause in writing. That’s what I would do. If there were good cause, I would consider it. If there were not good cause, it wouldn’t matter to me what anybody says.” But both Rosenstein and Sessions serve at the pleasure of the president, and if Rosenstein refused to fire Mueller, in theory, Trump could appoint someone to Rosenstein’s job who would do his bidding, just as Nixon did after the infamous ”Saturday Night Massacre,” where Robert Bork (yes, that Robert Bork) carried out Nixon’s wishes. Ruddy issued a terse response directed at Spicer, but also admitted he didn’t speak to Trump personally about this. ”Spicer issued a bizarre late night press release that a) doesn’t deny my claim the President is considering firing Mueller and b) says I didn’t speak to the President about the matter  —   when I never claimed to have done so,” Ruddy told Politico Playbook and others in an email. ”Memo to Sean: focus your efforts on exposing the   Russian allegations against POTUS and highlighting his remarkable achievements! Don’t waste time trying to undermine one of your few allies.” The president himself got in on the act this morning, tweeting about ”fake news” and ”phony sources”: But Ruddy continued to double, triple and quadruple down Tuesday morning. On CSPAN: ”I have some good sources in the administration. I think it’s an accurate statement.” On CNN to anchor Chris Cuomo: ”I think it is a consideration the president has had, because Mueller is illegitimate as special counsel. Chris, remember there is no evidence of wrongdoing there’s no evidence of collusion there’s no evidence of obstruction. . .. The basis of his investigation is  .” CNN also reported, per an administration source, ”No one is recommending that,” but it ”hasn’t been ruled out.” 1. There has been a   effort to delegitimize Mueller. See, for example, Newt Gingrich’s changed tone. From a conservative radio talk show: ”I think Congress should now intervene and they should abolish the independent counsel, because Comey makes so clear that it’s the poison fruit of a deliberate manipulation by the FBI director leaking to the New York Times, deliberately set up this particular situation. It’s very sick.” On Twitter Monday, Gingrich said, ”Republicans are delusional if they think” Mueller ”is going to be fair” (Gingrich appears to be referring to donations to Democrats by some members of Mueller’s team, as reported on by CNN): Less than a month ago, he called Mueller a ”superb choice,” someone whose ”reputation is impeccable for honesty and integrity.” And he’s not the only one: 2. Let’s not overthink this: Trump, his allies and his White House also just like to mess with the media and stir confusion among the public. They don’t mind stirring the pot to distract, deliberately provoke and disrupt. They have done it before: Think about how it floated the idea of Mueller’s potential conflicts of interest and remember those charges of Democratic ties to acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe? It’s all an effort to manufacture news cycles, create conflicts, distract from other pressing issues and raise questions about someone for a couple days. When it dies down, in the end, they hope they’ve succeeded in muddying up opponents.": "165560",
    "“A little learning is a dangerous thing,” wrote the poet Alexander Pope. Three centuries later, Pope’s aphorism perfectly  —   and dangerously  —   describes President Trump’s understanding of history as a   clash of civilizations in which “the West” can triumph by imposing its will.  The speech Trump delivered Thursday in Warsaw’s Krasinski Square might have been appropriate when Britannia ruled the waves and Europe’s great powers held dominion over “lesser” peoples around the globe. It had nothing useful to say about today’s interconnected world in which goods, people and ideas have contempt for borders.  “The fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive,” the president said. “Do we have the confidence in our values to defend them at any cost? Do we have enough respect for our citizens to protect our borders? Do we have the desire and the courage to preserve our civilization in the face of those who would subvert and destroy it?” Trump added what he probably thought of as a Churchillian flourish: “I declare today for the world to hear that the West will never, ever be broken. Our values will prevail. Our people will thrive. And our civilization will triumph. ” Triumph over whom? Trump mentioned “radical Islamic terrorism” as one of the enemies posing “dire threats to our security and to our way of life,” but he didn’t stop there. He went on to add Russia and  —   weirdly  —   “the steady creep of government bureaucracy” to the list. It is appalling that the president would describe patriotic public servants as a kind of fifth column that “drains the vitality and wealth of the people,” and I guess some precious bodily fluids as well. But what does Trump mean when he speaks of “the West” and its civilization? “Americans, Poles and the nations of Europe value individual freedom and sovereignty,” he said. “We must work together to confront forces, whether they come from inside or out, from the South or the East, that threaten over time to undermine these values and to erase the bonds of culture, faith and tradition that make us who we are. . . . We write symphonies. We pursue innovation. We celebrate our ancient heroes, embrace our timeless traditions and customs, and always seek to explore and discover   frontiers. ” That’s what I mean about a little learning. If the president read a few history books, he’d know that for most of the past 2, 000 years, China and India were the world’s leading economic powers and Europe was a relatively primitive backwater. He’d know that Europe rose to dominance not by erecting walls but by opening itself to the rest of the world  —   its resources, products and people. There is nothing pure about Western civilization. Its ability to absorb and incorporate outside influences has proved a great strength, not a weakness. Imagine Italy without tomato sauce, a gift from the New World  —   or the United States without the   companies founded by immigrants, gifts from the Old. Of course Trump is right to call for a united front against terrorism. But the solution, in a globalized world, cannot be to hunker behind walls, however big and beautiful those walls might be. Industrial supply chains cross borders and span oceans. Words and images flash around the globe at the speed of light. Global issues, such as nuclear proliferation and climate change, demand global solutions. Like it or not, we are all in this together. The correct response to the terrorism threat, which is real, is to isolate it as an abomination that is as much a grievous insult to Islam as to any other faith  —   and that has taken the lives of far more Muslims than  . The wrong response is to posit that “the West” is besieged by, and therefore at war with, a hostile civilization. That’s a fight in which everyone loses. Trump did finally make clear that the United States remains fully committed to Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which states that an attack on one member of the alliance is tantamount to an attack on all. He was tougher on Russia than in the past, and he cited “propaganda, financial crimes and cyberwarfare” as “new forms of aggression” that must be countered.  But viewing the fight against terrorism as some kind of civilizational Armageddon is wrong. Trump seems to view himself as the West’s defender against 1. 6 billion Muslims, almost all of whom want only to live in peace. We need a capable president, not a crusader in chief.

    "The man accused of murdering a Virginia police officer on her first shift is an   Army staff sergeant assigned to the Pentagon. Ronald W. Hamilton, 32, is an employee at the Joint Staff Support Center, a Defense Information Systems Agency spokesperson confirmed to Fox News. Hamilton has been charged with capital murder of a police officer and   murder for the death of Ashley Guindon, 28, and two counts of malicious wounding of a police officer and two counts of use of a firearm in commission of a felony.  He’s being held without bond ahead of an expected Monday arraignment. “This is a sad day for everybody in this room,” Prince William County Commonwealth Attorney Paul Ebert said during a Sunday news conference. “It’s a sad day for law enforcement. ” Officials said Hamilton shot and killed Guindon and wounded Officer Jesse Hempen, 31, and Officer David McKeown, 33, when they responded to a domestic disturbance call early Saturday evening. McKeown, a   veteran of the force, was Guindon’s field training officer. Both Hempen and McKeown remained hospitalized Sunday, though authorities wouldn’t detail the extent of their injuries. “We are certainly led to believe their recovery will be full they’re not at risk of   injuries,” Prince William County Police Chief Steve Hudson said. “But doctors have been very cautious to tell us there’s a long road ahead. ” After Guindon, Hempen and McKeown were shot, additional officers responded and were able to secure Hamilton’s surrender without further incident. When they entered the home, however, cops found Hamilton’s wife, Crystal Hamilton, shot dead. The couple’s    son was also in the home, unharmed. He’s currently in the care of family and friends. While Guindon was on her first shift as an officer, she had a long history with the unit, Hudson said. She interned with the department in the forensics service section while attending graduate school in 2011, and later applied and was accepted as a police officer. But during her initial field training period in June, she chose to resign for personal reasons, which Hudson did not disclose. Guindon, however, reapplied and the department rehired her earlier in February. She was sworn in the day before she was killed. “When she came back and reapplied, we were struck by her passion to do this job,” Hudson said. “She did share with us, when we rehired her, she felt like she still wanted to do this job. She couldn’t get it out of her blood. It was something she felt she could pour herself into. ” Guindon had also served in the U. S. Marine Corps Reserve for six years, Hudson said. Her death was just the fourth line of duty death for the department since 1970 and she was only the second officer to be killed during a felony crime in the department’s history, the previous instance coming in 1990.

    "The International Energy Agency (IEA) is supposed to be the world’s leading expert on energy markets. Its analyses of crude oil prices and supplies make headlines, roil Wall Street, and shape how policymakers see the world.    And right now, the IEA is a little baffled. ”Attempting to understand how the oil market will look during the next five years is today a task of enormous complexity,” the IEA said, almost apologetically, in its latest   Oil Market Report. ”Some certainties that have guided our past outlooks are now not so certain at all.” Here’s the main issue: Over the past two years, crude oil prices have utterly collapsed. Back in June 2014, it cost more than $100 to buy a barrel of Brent crude (the main global benchmark for oil prices). Today it costs just $34, the lowest level in more than a decade:            That collapse was a shock at the time, though most analysts now broadly agree what happened. For much of the 2000s, crude demand was rising fast, and supplies struggled to keep up. Prices soared. Those high prices, in turn, made it profitable for companies to extract oil from    places like the shale formations of North Dakota and Texas. Then global demand started sagging. And pretty soon, there was a supply glut  —   causing prices to crash. (I’ve simplified a bit, but the full story’s here.)    The real puzzle, however, is what happens next. And this is a really difficult problem for the IEA. Because many of the old assumptions about how oil markets work no longer seem to apply.    The past two years have upended three big assumptions about oil markets Let’s step back for a second and look at the chart below. Ever since 2014, the world’s producers have been pumping out far more oil than anyone needs. Oil production (in green) is outstripping consumption (in yellow). The rest gets stored in stockpiles (blue):    International Energy Agency Oil Market Report)”    =”main_image”>  International Energy Agency Oil Market Report)”>       Normally when this happens, you’d expect an adjustment. Low oil prices should cause producers with high costs to cut back on drilling. Cheap oil should give consumers incentive to use much more of it. Eventually supply and demand should come back into balance, and prices should stabilize or even rise again.    But events haven’t transpired in quite the way everyone expected. The IEA notes that, a year ago, many analysts predicted the market would come into balance by late 2015. ”That view proved to be very wide of the mark.” Instead, oil prices kept plummeting. Basically, three unexpected things happened: 1) US oil production proved more resilient than anyone expected. It’s expensive to extract oil from shale rock via fracking in places like North Dakota and Texas; the wells deplete quickly, and you have to keep drilling new ones. So many observers figured low oil prices would throttle output there. But instead, US shale drillers managed to slash costs and boost their productivity. Yes, many of these firms are now facing serious financial pain. But the oil’s still flowing. US crude production is down only slightly from 2015’s record highs:            This doesn’t just apply to shale. In the United States, offshore production has reached record highs in the Gulf of Mexico, despite low prices. The IEA notes that various technological advances are relentlessly driving down drilling costs, making oil supplies more resilient to price drops.    2) OPEC hasn’t really tried to prop up prices. In the past, when oil prices plunged, OPEC countries like Saudi Arabia often worked together to cut back on output in order to prop up prices and keep their budgets in the black. This time, that hasn’t happened. Instead, OPEC’s members have been ramping up output in a frantic fight for market share. Russia and Saudi Arabia are now pumping crude oil at record levels. Iraq has doubled oil production since 2014 as it recovers from war. Iran is starting to bolster exports now that   sanctions have been lifted. And there’s little hope this will change. A recent overture by Russia and Saudi Arabia to freeze production hasn’t (yet) persuaded the rest of the cartel to follow suit. And none of OPEC’s members are contemplating actual production cuts. 3) Oil demand hasn’t surged as fast as expected. Again, when prices are cheap, you’d expect oil demand to soar. But demand growth has been (relatively) sluggish in recent years. Much of that is due to ongoing economic torpor in China and Europe. But some developing countries are also starting to pare back fuel subsidies in order to alleviate strains on their budget. And many countries are considering efficiency measures to cut back on oil consumption for environmental reasons. Add those up, and global oil markets no longer work quite the same way they used to. That makes predictions harder. Here’s the IEA again:  Some certainties that have guided our past outlooks are now not so certain at all: that oil prices falling to   lows will lead to a strong demand growth spurt; that oil prices falling to   lows will lead to a mass   of   high cost oil production; and not least that oil prices falling to   lows will force the largest group of producing countries to cut output to stabilise oil prices.  So what happens next? Here’s the IEA’s best guess. With those lessons in mind, the IEA is now hazarding a fresh guess for what happens over the next five years. With the caveat, of course, that predictions are hard and very often wrong.    The bottom line: In 2016 and 2017, the IEA expects production to continue to outpace demand. Barring something unexpected, like a fresh conflict in the Middle East, ”it is hard to see oil prices recovering significantly in the short term from [current] low levels.” Cheap oil is likely to stay with us for another year or two, at least. But the agency also warns that this situation may not last forever. Low prices will lead to less investment in new production capacity over the next few years. Yet global demand is expected to keep rising during that time. So at some point in the future, demand is likely to outstrip supply again. When that happens, the failure to invest in new capacity could lead to supply disruptions and the return of spiking prices:            ”It is easy for consumers to be lulled into complacency by ample stocks and low prices today, but they should heed the writing on the wall: the historic investment cuts we are seeing raise the odds of unpleasant   surprises in the   ” IEA executive director Fatih Birol said in a statement. More specifically, the IEA is predicting: 1) Oil supplies will rise by about 4. 1 million barrels per day between 2015 and 2021. That’s a much slower pace than the 11 million barrels added between 2009 and 2015. Iran and Iraq will keep increasing production, though new investment will be limited by ”political uncertainties” in both countries. The US is expected to see a modest drop in shale production this year as low prices bite  —   a loss of about 600, 000 barrels per day in 2016  —   before output eventually rises again as prices nudge upward. Many officials now think a big chunk of shale production will come back online when prices get back to $50 or $60 per barrel. 2) Global oil demand will grow at a modest pace, around 1. 2 percent per year, through 2021. The IEA doesn’t expect demand to surge more rapidly than that in the near term, in part because the global economy has a lot of soft spots, and in part because many developing countries (where most demand growth is happening) are expected to take steps to reduce fuel subsidies and curb vehicle use to reduce pollution.    3) Thanks to low oil prices, investment in new production capacity will keep falling. The IEA expects a drop of 24 percent in 2015 and 17 percent in 2016.   countries like Nigeria, Venezuela, and Algeria will see a particular crunch. By the end of the   forecast, this lack of investment could lead to supply shocks and possible price spikes. ”The risk of a sharp oil price rise towards the later part of our forecast arising from insufficient investment is as potentially   as the sharp oil price fall has proved to be.” Now, could those predictions be wrong? Of course. It’s possible, for instance, that the IEA has overcorrected for the lessons of the last two years. Perhaps US shale production will collapse more sharply than expected. Perhaps demand will end up surging. Or perhaps something different entirely will happen. Ultimately, the IEA concludes, oil markets are in somewhat uncharted territory, which makes projections about the future particularly difficult. The fact that OPEC members are no longer coordinating to stabilize prices  —   but are instead pumping out as much as they can to maintain their market positions  —   has led to an entirely new oil era:  In 2016, we are living in perhaps the first truly free oil market we have seen since the pioneering days of the industry. In today’s oil world, anybody who can produce oil sells as much as possible for whatever price can be achieved. Just a few years ago such a    would have been unimaginable but today it is the reality and we must get used to it, unless the [OPEC] producers build on the recent announcement and change their output maximisation strategy.  ”The   consequences of this new era,” the agency concludes, ”are still not fully understood.” Further reading:   Why crude oil prices keep falling and falling, in one simple chart   Why the   Arabia move to stabilize oil prices isn’t likely to work": "199252",
    "The United States is weighing imposing sanctions on countries that do business with North Korea and looking for ways to revive strained relations with Russia, U. S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Tuesday. At a committee hearing, he also defended President Donald Trump’s plans for steep reductions in U. S. spending on diplomacy and foreign aid. Senators from both major parties charged that such cuts would ultimately hurt America. At the start Tillerson told lawmakers that North Korea had released Otto Warmbier, a U. S. university student held captive for 17 months, and the United States was seeking the release of three other detained Americans.  Washington has sought to increase economic and political pressure on Pyongyang because of its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The North has conducted five nuclear tests and is believed to be making progress toward an intercontinental ballistic missile that could hit the United States. Tillerson said Washington is discussing North Korea with all of its allies, and seeing some response from China, its biggest trading partner. He said North Korea would top the agenda at  next week’s   talks between U. S. and Chinese officials. Tillerson said the United States would have to work with other countries to deny North Korea access to basics such as oil and will have to consider whether to impose sanctions on those doing business with North Korea. ”We are in a stage where we are moving into this next effort of, ’Are we going to have to, in effect, start taking secondary  sanctions because countries we have provided information to  have not, or are unwilling, or don’t have the ability to do that? ’” Tillerson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Because the United States has no trade with the North, its strongest way to impose economic pressure is through ”secondary sanctions” that threaten companies from third countries with losing access to the U. S. market if they deal with Pyongyang. TIES WITH RUSSIA AT A LOW Asked whether the United States wanted to see an   global embargo to deny exports of petroleum and other products to North Korea, Tillerson said that this would only work if Russia and China, the North’s main suppliers, cooperated. Tillerson repeated his view that U. S. relations with Russia  were at an all   and still deteriorating. Ties have been strained by differences over Syria, Ukraine and allegations, denied by Moscow, of Russian efforts to influence the 2016 U. S. presidential election. He said the administration was trying to find a way to   a working relationship, notably on Syria. It took years of diplomacy with Russia and China to achieve consensus among major powers to impose the sanctions on Iran and a similar result with the North seems unlikely given Beijing’s reluctance to destabilize its neighbors. Asked if China had lived up to its pledges to crack down on the North, Tillerson said its actions had been ”uneven,” but added: ”They have taken steps, visible steps that we can confirm. We are in discussions with them about entities inside of China.” The purpose of Tillerson’s appearance, his first of four congressional hearings this week, was to discuss the budget. In all, the Trump proposal cuts about 32 percent from U. S. diplomacy and aid budgets, or nearly $19 billion. Committee members, including some of Trump’s fellow Republicans, spoke sharply against the plan. Republicans control both houses of Congress, which sets the federal government budget. Separately, 16 retired senior generals and other   officers said they would submit joint testimony to the Senate on Wednesday about the importance of foreign aid to national security.

    "Let’s hope there’s generous funding in Republicans’ new   bill to prevent and cure  . Wednesday was International Women’s Day, and to observe this annual commemoration House Republicans formally took up their legislation defunding Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest provider of health services for women. House Speaker Paul Ryan, at a news conference Wednesday morning, boasted about ending the funding of Planned Parenthood, listing it as one of the things “we’ve been dreaming about doing. ” And what better time to make this dream come true than on International Women’s Day, on the eighth day of Women’s History Month? This could be the beginning of a new legislative style in Congress: Bills to “build the wall” could be marked up on Cinco de Mayo. The Iranian nuclear deal could be scrapped later this month on Nowruz. Plans to cut military assistance to Europe could be rolled out on  . It’s enough to give new meaning to National Awkward Moments Day  —   observed on March 18.  President Trump, in a morning tweet, marked International Women’s Day by hailing women as “vital to the fabric of our society. ” But that’s not quite the message his administration and its allies in Congress have been sending. Women’s rights activists held a strike and protests Wednesday, declaring it “A Day Without a Woman. ” In the Trump White House, it must often feel like that kind of day  —   and not only because Melania is in New York. A USA Today analysis last month found that men outnumbered women by more than 2 to 1 among top White House aides. Trump named only four women to his Cabinet, the fewest in a generation, and none to the top jobs at the State, Treasury, Defense and Justice Departments. His nominee for labor secretary withdrew as opponents made an issue of the way he and his company treated women, and Trump fired acting attorney general Sally Yates, an Obama administration holdover, after she refused to back his first travel ban. Meeting with the nation’s governors recently, Trump welcomed the governors “and their wives and daughters,” as if no women were governors. Trump’s vulgar statements about women, caught on tape, were a prominent part of the campaign, and, according to the media outlet Axios, he requires women working for him to “dress like women. ” He has hired as his executive assistant in the White House a    barre fitness instructor who served as the elevator “greeter” at Trump Tower.  And it isn’t just about appearances, as Emily’s List, a Democratic group that supports abortion rights, notes. On Jan. 23, two days after the huge Women’s March in the nation’s capital and other cities, Trump signed an executive order reinstating the global gag rule denying international funding to any organization that discusses abortion, even if the group doesn’t perform abortions. A photo of the signing showed Trump surrounded by men. Trump on his first day in office signed an order to “ease the burden” of Obamacare and has blessed the congressional legislation that could end Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion and its rule requiring insurance plans to cover maternity care. The bill is silent on the provision in Obamacare requiring contraception to be provided at low cost. Medicaid and other social programs that disproportionately benefit women are facing severe cutbacks in Trump’s budget. Trump, who promised to appoint justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade, nominated to the court Neil Gorsuch, who wrote the appellate decision in the Hobby Lobby case exempting employers from providing birth control as part of employer health plans if it conflicts with management’s religious beliefs. On immigration, Reuters reported over the weekend that the Trump administration is weighing a new policy to separate women from their children when they are caught entering the United States illegally. As of the end of last week, only eight bills had been passed by the new Congress and signed into law by Trump, half of them noncontroversial “suspension” bills. But it isn’t for lack of trying. Republicans in Congress have introduced a variety of abortion bans. The House passed the “No Taxpayer Funding of Abortion Act,” which opponents charge could block even private insurance from covering abortion. The House passed a bill overturning a rule President Barack Obama signed in December forbidding discrimination against Planned Parenthood and other family planning providers under Title X  —   clearing the way, Democrats say, to reducing access to contraception. The Senate, likewise, used the Congressional Review Act in its vote to overturn Obama’s “Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces” rule, designed to protect against, among other things, sexual harassment in the workplace. That’s quite a bit, and it’s still early. If this is how Trump and his allies in Congress celebrate International Women’s Day, one shudders to think how they will observe April 5: National Go for Broke Day.

    "Our former colleague Eliana Johnson has a short profile of the guy launching American Affairs, the forthcoming intellectual journal of Trumpism, rising   from the ashes of the Journal of American Greatness. A    conservative wunderkind is out to intellectualize Trumpism, the amorphous ideology that lifted its namesake to the presidency in November. Until recently, the idea itself was an oxymoron, since Trumpism has consisted in large part of the  ’s ruthless evisceration of the country’s intellectual elite. But next month, Julius Krein, a 2008 Harvard graduate who has spent most of his admittedly short career in finance, is launching a journal of public policy and political philosophy with an eye toward laying the intellectual foundation for the Trump movement. If his nerdy swagger is any indication, he has big ambitions: He noted wryly that he is  —   “coincidentally”  —   the same age that William F. Buckley Jr. was six decades ago when he founded National Review, the magazine that became the flagship of the conservative movement. But other than that, I’m glad someone is doing this. The conservative movement needs more   not less. I agree with Yuval Levin, who tells Johnson, “Not nearly enough of that is happening around the changes we’ve seen in this election. ” Also, a thing like “Trumpism” deserves an intellectual effort to define it in   terms. That said, I’m skeptical of some of Krein’s larger ambitions. Johnson reports that American Affairs will “launch in both a print and digital version, and a substantial portion of the funding will come from Krein himself. He said donors to traditional conservative institutions have been ’surprisingly’ receptive to his pitch, though he declined to name the additional contributors. ” How receptive could the donors be if the editor is largely  ? It’s even harder when Donald Trump is your lodestar. I’m quoted in the piece: “It will take a good deal of time for even Trump’s most gifted apologists to craft an intellectually or ideologically coherent theme or narrative to his program,” said Jonah Goldberg, a senior editor of National Review. “Trump boasts that he wants to be unpredictable and insists that he will make all decisions on a    basis. That’s a hard approach for an intellectual journal to defend in every particular. ” My point there is you beat ideas with ideas. You can challenge the “theoretical foundations of ‘conservatism’” (perhaps starting with an explanation for why you put it in scare quotes) or you can defend a theoretical program. Unless you’re just going to defend Pragmatism   the instinctual, infallible, wisdom of Donald Trump in all cases, you’ll either need your own theory of the case or you’ll need to allow for writers willing to criticize Trump outright. There’s nothing wrong with that, except American Affairs is being launched to defend Trump and Trumpism. If Krein isn’t willing to tolerate serious criticism of Trump in furtherance of Trumpism, then he should skip the journal and go work directly for Sean Spicer. If he does allow criticism, (a) good for him and (b) he should be prepared for his   journal to be denounced by Trump himself. While I am perfectly comfortable saying that Krein is no William F. Buckley  —   because no one is  —   I would note that great magazines and journals are often born out of such chaos and internal contradictions. Irving Kristol and Daniel Bell founded The Public Interest (which was more of an inspiration for neoconservatives than was The National Interest, contrary to what Eliana wrote). But they had some pretty profound disagreements, causing Bell to walk away early on. Irving Kristol solved these, and similar, problems by making the PI a magazine for writers, not editors. At National Review we had an even more stormy beginning, with libertarians, Machiavellians, Ultramontane Catholics, Straussian philosophers, social conservatives of every flavor, and a wide variety of   squabbling and debating everything under the sun. The creative tension was invaluable in forming the foundation of modern conservatism. Bill Buckley made it work through sheer force of personality. We didn’t have a fan in the Oval Office until Ronald Reagan. The New Republic (now a pale shadow of its former self) was always at its best when it was at war with itself. I grew up on it in the 1980s, when many of the editors hated one another’s guts and fought over Reagan, the Contras, etc. The magazine’s early years were even more chaotic. The New Republic was founded, according to Walter Lippmann (a   New Republic staffer as well as an aide to Woodrow Wilson) “to explore and develop and apply the ideas which had been advertised by Theodore Roosevelt when he was the leader of the Progressive party. ” Pretty much TR was to The New Republic as Trump is to American Affairs. But when Wilson was elected, and started leading us to war, The New Republic was all over the map because of disagreements among the editors. Eventually, their old ideological hero Teddy Roosevelt charged into the offices of The New Republic like a Bull Moose to chew them out for their disloyalty. Realizing he couldn’t set them straight, TR shouted that the magazine was “a negligible sheet, run by two anemic Gentiles and two uncircumcised Jews. ” If Trump tweets something like that at Krein  Co. he’ll know he’s on his way to “greatness. ”,": "114769",

Prime Minister Theresa May, who was forced to apologize for the government’s initial slow response to the tragedy, said the authorities were now racing to establish what needed to be done.  ”In some cases it’s possible to take mitigating action,” she told Sky news. ”In others it’s been necessary for people to move out on a temporary basis and that is what happened in Camden last night.” Some 4, 000 residents of the Chalcots Estate in Camden, north London, were told to vacate their apartments on Friday after the Fire Brigade ruled that their blocks were unsafe.  Emerging into the streets on a hot night, residents clutched children, pets and small amounts of clothing and food to try to find a bed in a local hotel or with family or friends. Many were directed to inflatable beds laid out on the floor of the local sports hall.  ”I know it’s difficult but Grenfell changes everything,” Georgia Gould, Leader of Camden Council, said in a statement. ”I don’t believe we can take any risks with our residents’ safety.” May said the local authority would be given all the means necessary to make sure people had somewhere to stay.  Residents complained of first hearing about the evacuation from the media and getting very short notice to leave from city officials going   . Not all residents agreed to go, as they felt the evacuation was an  . PUBLIC ANGER ”It was farcical communication,”    Daniel Tackaberry told Reuters outside a nearby sports center where the local council had laid out air beds. ”You don’t get everyone to leave this quickly.” Several local councils said they were removing cladding from the facades of buildings that had failed the tests. In Camden, however, the London Fire Brigade found a number of faults, including concern about cladding, faulty fire doors and holes in compartment walls that could help a fire to spread.      Gould, the Camden council’s leader, said it would take up to four weeks to repair the blocks that were evacuated.  Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said the government was working with local authorities and fire services to address any problems that had been found.  ”We are now rapidly identifying buildings of concern: samples are being tested very quickly; fire inspectors are checking the safety of the buildings as a whole; and we have issued interim safety guidance,” he said.  Police investigating the cause of the   Grenfell Tower blaze have said the fire started in a fridge but spread rapidly due to external cladding on the building, trapping residents in their beds as they slept.  The cladding has since failed all safety checks and prompted a nationwide review of the materials used on everything from hospitals to hotels and apartment blocks. The fire has become a flashpoint for public anger at the record of May’s Conservative Party in government following cuts to local authority budgets designed to lower the national deficit. Grenfell Tower is located in Kensington, one of the richest boroughs in Europe.  Battling to save her position after losing her majority in a June 8 election, May has promised to do everything she can to protect those residents who survived the fire and to improve the quality and safety of public housing in Britain. British police have said they are considering bringing manslaughter charges over the Grenfell fire.

    "Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump used Facebook to release a new ad yesterday warning that politicians are incrementally weakening the Second Amendment and pledging that he will not allow Americans to be disarmed. [The ad is titled “Second Amendment. ” In it, Trump says:  So important is our Second Amendment. The politicians are chipping away at it day by day, night by night, [and] it gets weaker and weaker. We’re not going to let it happen. We are going to protect our Second Amendment. If I’m president, you can count on it 100 percent. Below the ad, Trump exclaimed, “I won’t let them take away our guns! !” This squares perfectly with what Trump has been saying through the primary campaign. Last April, Trump told Breitbart News (emphasis in the original): It is so important that we maintain the Second Amendment and that we maintain it strongly. And one of the main reasons is because the good people, the upstanding people, follow laws and norms but the bad ones don’t. So if the Second Amendment weren’t there to protect our rights and someone tampered with them, the good people would be affected but the bad people wouldn’t care —  they couldn’t care less. It is absolutely imperative that we maintain the Second Amendment in its strongest form.

    "(CNN) Donald Trump’s campaign is beginning to pick apart Hillary Clinton’s new running mate, seeking to flip Tim Kaine’s image from moderate and experienced elected official to that of career politician beholden to special interests. Trump and his campaign are pouncing on the Virginia senator as an opportunity to draw a fresh contrast between Trump’s outsider brand and Clinton’s status as a   Washington insider    a contrast Trump drew successfully time and again with his GOP primary opponents. The campaign is raising everything from the gifts Kaine received during his time as Virginia’s governor to his past support for the   Partnership trade deal to label the newly formed Democratic ticket as guarantors of the ”rigged system” Trump has so often decried on the campaign trail. ”If we went to central casting for someone who gives us the clearest contrast against the   ticket, they couldn’t have picked a better person from our perspective,” a senior Trump adviser said. ”They are doubling down on the status quo. They are doubling down on the system as it currently stands.” The campaign will continue to draw that contrast in the coming days as Trump hits the campaign trail in crucial swing states such as Florida and North Carolina in addition to poking holes in Kaine’s record as governor, the adviser said. The campaign began challenging Kaine by blasting out opposition research on Saturday and will continue to knock Kaine’s record on job creation, taxes and the size of government, the adviser said. Less than two hours after Clinton announced she had picked the junior senator from Virginia, the Trump campaign pumped out highlights from a recent news report that raised the more than $160, 000 in gifts Kaine received from businesses and political donors during eight years as Virginia’s lieutenant governor and governor. ”If you think Crooked Hillary and Corrupt Kaine are going to change anything in Washington, it’s just the opposite,” Trump’s senior communications adviser Jason Miller said in a statement, revealing a new moniker for Clinton’s running mate. ”It’s only fitting that Hillary Clinton would select an ethically challenged insider like Tim Kaine who’s personally benefited from the rigged system.” Kaine spokeswoman Amy Dudley rebutted the corruption allegations, insisting Kaine ”went beyond the requirements of Virginia law, promptly disclosing any and all gifts received, including those beneath the reporting threshold.” ”All disclosure information    the vast majority of which was for   travel expenses rather than gifts    has been publicly available for years and never once raised any concerns of impropriety,” Dudley said in a statement. The Clinton campaign declined to respond to a request for comment on the Trump campaign’s allegations about Kaine. Kaine is a   figure on Capitol Hill, known for his initial skepticism of the Iran nuclear deal and his unrelenting calls for Congress to pass a new authorization of military force in the fight against ISIS    earning him the praise of some Republicans. ”Trying to count the ways I hate @timkaine,” tweeted Sen. Jeff Flake,  . ”Drawing a blank. Congrats to a good man and a good friend.” But the Trump campaign pressed forward Saturday morning, blasting out additional opposition research pressing forward with its assault on Kaine that labeled him a ”career politician” lacking a signature accomplishment as governor. Trump followed up his campaign’s messaging in a series of tweets Saturday morning that accused Kaine of being ”owned by the banks” and slammed his support for the   Partnership, which Trump has railed against during his campaign. ”Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!” Trump tweeted, despite the fact that his own running mate has also voiced support for the TPP deal. Miller, a Trump campaign spokesman, rejected the comparison between Indiana Gov. Mike Pence’s support of TPP and Kaine’s. ”Both Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine have supported bad trade deal after bad trade deal, and given their track records, nobody has confidence in their ability to negotiate for trade deals that actually help American workers.” The Trump campaign is working to upend the perception that Kaine, a moderate Democrat with decades of political experience and strong national security credentials, was a safe pick. Instead, it is using Kaine’s selection as fresh ammo to fuel its characterization of Clinton as a corrupt figure. And it’s also seizing the opportunity to try and siphon off supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders, Clinton’s chief opponent in the Democratic primary whose fighting rhetoric against special interests and free trade deals defined his campaign. Trump made his latest appeal to Sanders supporters Saturday morning, tweeting that they ”are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for.” ”Bernie supporters are outraged,” Trump tweeted. ”Bernie fought for nothing!” While Sanders and his most prominent supporters have emphatically rejected the possibility of his supporters moving to Trump’s campaign, Clinton’s pick has drawn a mixed response from progressive groups worried the Kaine pick could allow Trump to ”outflank” Clinton on trade. And Trump campaign advisers believe they can also use Kaine to highlight an enthusiasm gap between the Republican and Democratic tickets. ”They went with an insider who generates little to no enthusiasm for their base, who’s wrong on the core issues and who represents everything that is wrong with the rigged system that we see in Washington today,” the senior adviser said. The Trump campaign, sometimes known for its haphazard, disorganized messaging, is hewing closely to its talking points on the Kaine issue. ”The Kaine VP pick does nothing but hurt Hillary Clinton because it plays into the narrative that the Democrats are bought and sold by special interests,” Boris Epshteyn, a Trump campaign surrogate, said Saturday on CNN. ”Both the Clintons and Tim Kaine have a lifelong history of taking money from special interests and being bought and paid by those special interests.”": "56262",
    "Manila police say the lone suspect who carried out Friday’s attack on a casino at a resort complex, that left dozens dead, was a heavily indebted    Filipino who was hooked on gambling, according to his family. In a Sunday news conference, the National Capital Region Police Office Police Chief Oscar Albayalde said the gunman was identified by his estranged wife and his parents as Jessie Carlos, a father of three, and a former Department of Finance employee, Rappler reports. He owed more than $80, 000 USD, the local news service reports, ”plus an undisclosed amount of    debts, due to his gambling problem.” The news backs up the police chief’s earlier claim that there’s ”no concrete evidence that the attack was terrorism.” ”This incident is confined to the act of one man alone as we have always said,” Albayalde says, according to The Associated Press. The attacker’s mother, Teodora, in tears during the news briefing, asked for forgiveness, the wire service reports. ”We can’t accept ourselves that my son became like this, he was a very kind son,” she said. ”He chose to end his life rather than . .. kill people.” The AP adds: ”The message of what happened to my son is people should not get hooked on gambling so their families won’t get destroyed,” she said. Albayalde said the man had sold off property to support his gambling habit of at least several years, including a vehicle. His family had grown so concerned they had asked casinos in the capital to ban their husband since April 3.

    "Donald Trump is boycotting Thursday’s final   GOP debate. And every Republican candidate should. Fox News is treating Trump worse than any liberal media outlet would —  worse, even than John Harwood and CNBC. [Last week, moderator Megan Kelly convened a special panel of   writers from National Review to mark the launch of their attack on Trump. This week, Fox News prepared for the debate by inviting a Muslim activist who has criticized Trump to be one of three YouTube personalities to question the candidates. And on Tuesday, as Trump considered whether to participate in the debate, Fox issued a petulant, snarky press statement mocking him:  We learned from a secret back channel that the Ayatollah and Putin both intend to treat Donald Trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president  —   a nefarious source tells us that Trump has his own secret plan to replace the Cabinet with his Twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetings. No candidate should agree to participate under those conditions. Indeed, the other GOP candidates —  including Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) who led the charge against Harwood —  should be standing with Trump against Fox, on principle, instead of attacking him. And conservatives who are mocking Trump should look in the mirror and ask themselves whether they are applying a different standard to   Fox News than they do to the mainstream media. Fox News’ behavior after Trump’s withdrawal vindicates his decision. The network issued a statement that attacked Trump politically —  “We’re not sure how Iowans are going to feel about him walking away from them at the last minute” —  and accused him of “terrorizations. ” Kelly followed up with radical leftist filmmaker Michael Moore on her program for what the Washington Post called a “televised ” where Moore defended her against Trump. How hard would it have been for Fox News simply to issue a statement expressing disappointment and reiterating that the debate would proceed as planned? Instead, Fox cast aside neutrality and integrity to join the political fray. Indeed, Politico is openly wondering whether Trump walked into Fox News’ “trap. ” No news network should try to “trap” a presidential candidate, but that is what Fox News appears to have done to Trump, damning him either way. Every candidate should expect difficult questions, and no presidential candidate has the right to dictate to networks which journalists should be allowed to ask them. If it were just a matter of Trump ducking Kelly’s tough questions, he would deserve to be criticized. After all, as Trump himself once told Kelly, debating takes courage. The nation already has one president who thinks he can bully the media, and Fox News in particular. It does not need another. But Fox News’ behavior towards Trump is the kind of bias viewers have turned to Fox to avoid. We would not tolerate it from NBC or CNN —  and we should not tolerate it when Fox News sinks to —  and below —  their level.": "41311",
    "(This version of the story corrects to add dropped ”former” from Berlusconi’s title in paragraph four) By John Irish and Agnieszka Flak   Vivendi ( ) said on Monday it holds just over 3 percent of Mediaset ( ) and could raise that to as much as 20 percent in a move the Italian broadcaster’s top investor called a first step toward launching a hostile takeover bid for the company. The announcement only aggravates a   feud between the French media giant, led by chairman and biggest shareholder Vincent Bollore, and the Italian broadcaster controlled by the family of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. The two companies have been at loggerheads since July when Vivendi backed out of an agreement that would have given it control of Mediaset’s   division Premium and handed the two firms 3. 5 percent stakes in each other. Buying into Mediaset is part of Bollore’s strategy to expand into southern Europe and transform the French company into an integrated European media powerhouse.  ”Vivendi intends to carry on its purchase of shares in Mediaset, depending on market conditions, to become, if possible, the second industrial shareholder in Mediaset, which to begin with could represent 10 to 20 percent of Mediaset’s capital,” it added. Berlusconi’s investment holding Fininvest, which controls Mediaset via a 34. 7 percent stake, lashed out at Vivendi, accusing it of trying to depress the company’s share price to then launch a ”hostile takeover” at a discounted price.  ”Vincent Bollore and Vivendi have shown what their true intentions towards Mediaset were from the very start,” it said. Fininvest added it does not intend to diminish its role as  Mediaset’s main shareholder and would use all means to block what it considered a ”very serious deception” of market rules. Bolloré, a key shareholder of Italian investment bank Mediobanca, has built a reputation over the years as a corporate raider, resorting to different strategies to take control of businesses. Vivendi is already the top shareholder at phone group Telecom Italia ( ) with a stake of around 24 percent and some bankers have spoken of plans to combine the two Italian firms. All parties have repeatedly denied such speculation.  Mediaset, which is already suing Vivendi for damages over the   deal, echoed Fininvest’s comments, adding it had been unaware of Vivendi’s stake building until the statement.  Vivendi said in October it was no longer keen on finding an amicable solution to the dispute following several accusations by Mediaset. ”Given that the strategic industrial partnership . .. goes beyond what’s at stake in this dispute, Vivendi announces that it has gone over the 3 percent threshold in Mediaset’s capital and now holds 3. 01 percent,” it said on Monday.

    "There are two great capitals of liberal internationalism in Europe. One is the Hague, where sits the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court. The International Criminal Court, established by the Rome Statute over the objections of the United States, is the philosophical heir to the ad hoc tribunals at Nuremberg that saw to the necessary business of hanging Nazis such as Werner Braune and Otto Ohlendorf after World War II. Besides the International Criminal Court, which is tasked with prosecuting crimes against humanity, war crimes, and crimes of genocide, the Hague is home to an older and related institution, which labors under the unwieldy name of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991. Karadzic, with his famous silvery mop, is the face of a conflict about which Americans were conflicted, it being one of those terribly complicated post —  Cold War episodes involving a country that isn’t there any more. After the war, the nationalist crank changed his name and became a practitioner of the homeopathic healing arts, even publishing a few articles on the subject. Which is to say, he attempted to follow in reverse the career of Michael Weiner, the Berkeley quack (author of Herbs That Heal: A Prescription for Herbal Healing) who you know today as   ranter Michael Savage. The memory of Karadzic and his crimes faded quickly. Americans of a certain age will vaguely remember the siege of Sarajevo, domestic political questions about whether Newt Gingrich and congressional Republicans would use American involvement in Bosnia against President Bill Clinton, and perhaps some subsequent grumblings on some parts of the Right that we might have been fighting on the wrong side, given that the campaign against Slobodan Milosevic, Radovan Karadzic, and their allies put the United States effectively into alliance with radical Islamists, some of them connected to Osama bin Laden. Pat Buchanan, who was one of the leading voices against American involvement in Bosnia, would later draw parallels to U. S. pressure on Putin to make peace with the Chechens under the headline “Bin Laden’s Useful Idiots. ” Putin’s apologists, like Karadzic’s, believe that the strongmen of Eastern Europe are the Christian West’s first line of defense against the Islamic hordes, and thus are to be indulged. It is easy to imagine Donald Trump, whose admiration for Putin is plain, following that line of argument. In the Hague, we have a court dedicated to the belief that there exists a law of war, that there is such a thing as a war crime, and certain eternal rules of decency and humanness apply in every situation, even in the madness of war. In Brussels, we have the bloody and horrifying evidence that the Islamic world harbors a great many who reject those notions, who know no law but the savagery they call a religion, who revel in their indecency, who believe that the battlefield is everywhere and that all who fail to submit are the equivalent of soldiers at arms, to be dealt with by any means necessary. In the Hague, they are in the business of drawing lines: This is war, and beyond this is atrocity. For the jihadists, those lines are not boundaries, but starting lines. There is no equivalent to the Hague in the Islamic world, and that is not mere coincidence.

Photographer Allison Joyce felt compelled to travel there to see what has been happening. She spoke to In Sight about her experiences. “This is a story that I have been wanting to work on since the liberal ‘atheist’ bloggers started to be attacked in 2013. Things got even worse when in September 2015 an Italian citizen, Caesar Tavello, was shot and killed in what is considered to be one of the safest neighborhoods in Dhaka. The attack was claimed by ISIS, the first attack of its kind in Bangladesh, and it kicked off a series of attacks on foreigners and religious minorities across Bangladesh. Since Sept. 28, 2015, there have been seventeen attacks claimed by ISIS and Islamic extremists and since Feb. 15, 2013, six bloggers have been murdered, and many others injured in attacks. Visually, this was a difficult story to tell. It felt like we were chasing ghosts across the country. How do you illustrate radical groups who hide in the shadows? In the end, I decided to visit the victims of the attacks, photograph the sites where some of them took place, and visit the madrassa and mosque where the spiritual leader of the radical group, the Ansrullah Bangla Team, used to teach.

The trip also gave us a chance to spend time with a few Christian leaders living in the same region, who are living in the shadow of death threats they received from the Islamic State. Many of the bloggers and Christian leaders I spent time with live in a state of hyper vigilance, with a constant fear hanging over their heads that anywhere and anytime they could be attacked.

The letters contain threats against Christian leaders in Rangpur, Bangladesh. (Allison   Images)  The one ray of light that shined through during this project came while spending time with the incredible, courageous and brave the Rev. Barnbash, who goes by only one name. He has received multiple death threats from the Islamic State because of the work he does as a Christian priest in northern Bangladesh, but he continues on with his work as he has for the past decade or so, traveling around the district to lead services. We had been following him for half the day and had finally reached this small village after an hour and a half driving through bumpy, unpaved village roads. As soon as we reached the tiny church, the power went out in the village.

    "The American economy is improving, and   Donald Trump wants the credit. [“The U. S. Consumer Confidence Index for December surged nearly four points to 113. 7, THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN MORE THAN 15 YEARS!” he writes on Twitter.  “Thanks Donald!” he added, in an apparent attempt to kick off a slogan similar to the sarcastic “Thanks Obama” slogan that blamed the President of the United States for anything bad that happened. Trump’s message triggered liberals, who immediately sent outraged messages in response. “This guy Donald Trump is out of his mind,” wrote Keith Olbermann in response. “‘Thanks Donald! ?’ Seriously? Not ‘Thanks  —   Donald’ or ‘My thanks’  —   HE’S THANKING HIMSELF. ” Former Hillary Clinton staffers also reacted with scorn on Twitter. “Stop trying to make “Thanks Donald” happen. It’s not going to happen,” wrote Clinton’s former Social Media director Emmy Bengtson in response to Trump’s message. “Wouldn’t be the first time a white man, took credit for something he had nothing to do with,” wrote Clinton’s former Deputy Millennial Director Jamira Burley. “Next you’ll take credit for the moon landing, winning the civil war, discovering America. ” “And just like that Trump has duped everyone into making his compulsory narcissism trend, again,” wrote Christopher Huntley, Clinton’s former director of millennial media. “He does this on purpose, he’s like a toddler throwing fits for attention. And the world continues to give him just what he wants. #notnormal” Other bewildered fans of the current president reacted with disbelief at the  ’s audacity. “Are you trying to make a thanks, Obama type thing happen here?” wondered former Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor.

    "LONDON  —   Maybe it wasn’t just the iceberg. Ever since the Titanic sank more than 104 years ago, killing more than 1, 500 men, women and children, mystery has swirled around the tragedy. No one doubts that the ship collided at high speed with an iceberg off the coast of Newfoundland. But a new documentary posits that the sinking of the ship  —   hailed at the time as the largest ever built, and praised for its professed unsinkability  —   may have been accelerated by a giant coal fire in its hull that appeared to have started as long as three weeks before it set off on its fateful journey to New York from Southampton, England. In the documentary, which was broadcast on Channel 4 in Britain on New Year’s Day, Senan Molony, an Irish journalist who has spent more than 30 years researching the Titanic, contends that the fire, in a    bunker next to one of the ship’s boiler rooms, damaged its hull, helping to seal its fate long before it slammed into the iceberg. “It’s a perfect storm of extraordinary factors coming together: fire, ice and criminal negligence,” he argues in the documentary, “Titanic: The New Evidence,” which will air in the United States on the Smithsonian Channel on January 21. “The fire was known about, but it was played down. She should never have been put to sea. ” Mr. Molony’s potential breakthrough can be traced to an attic in Wiltshire, in southwest England, where a previously unpublished album of photographs chronicling the ship’s construction and the preparations for its maiden voyage had been gathering dust for more than a century. The photographs were discovered by a descendant of a director of the   company, Harland and Wolff, that built the Titanic. About four years ago, a collaborator of Mr. Molony’s acquired the rare photographs of the ship, meticulously taken by Harland and Wolff’s engineering chief before it left a Belfast shipyard. When the two men looked closely at the images, Mr. Molony said, they were shocked to discover a    diagonal black mark on the hull’s front starboard side, close to where the ship was pierced by the iceberg. An analysis by engineers at Imperial College London subsequently revealed that the mark was most likely caused by a fire in a coal bunker of the ship. Mr. Molony called the photographs “the Titanic equivalent of Tutankhamen’s tomb,” because of the richness of historical detail they conveyed, including the mark highlighting the extent of the damage. Experts said the theory was compelling but were divided over how important a role the fire may have played. In an interview, Richard de Kerbrech, a marine engineer based on the Isle of Wight who has written two books on the Titanic disaster, said that the fire would have damaged the ship’s bulkhead, a wall of steel within the ship’s hull, and made it more vulnerable after it was pierced by an iceberg. An official British inquiry, in 1912, mentioned the fire, but the judge who presided over it, whom critics saw as sympathetic to shipping interests, played it down. “This discovery is a revelation and could change our knowledge of the history of what happened,” Mr. de Kerbrech said. Mr. Molony contends that the ship’s owners knew about the fire but chose to let it go, since delaying the ship’s journey would have been financially ruinous. At the time of departure, the ship was berthed so that the marks caused by the fire were facing the sea, away from the dock, and therefore concealed from passengers. The Titanic disaster has long fanned conspiracy theories, among them that it was not the Titanic that sank on April 15, 1912, but, rather the Olympic, its sister ship that the Titanic was torpedoed by a German   or that the ship was brought down by a sarcophagus containing an Egyptian priestess’s mummy. Popularized by Hollywood, the story of the Titanic continues to exert a hold on popular culture. Construction of a   replica recently began at a theme park in China. Mr. Molony said his fascination took root when he was 12 and was gripped by “A Night to Remember,” Walter Lord’s 1955 book recounting the Titanic’s final night. He said he was so captivated that he finished the book in two hours and 40 minutes, the same time it took the Titanic to sink. Now the political editor at The Irish Daily Mail, Mr. Molony, who has also written a book called “The Irish Aboard Titanic,” was also drawn to the social divisions reflected on the ship, where   cabins hosted millionaires while hundreds of   passengers, many of them Irish, stayed below. Mr. Molony said he believed the fire had been played down, in part because death by iceberg was a more dramatic explanation. “The ship was seen as a heroic unsinkable ship and, as a result, people focused on explanations that fed that narrative,” he said. Not everyone is convinced. David Hill, a former honorary secretary of the British Titanic Society, who has been studying the cause of the sinking since the 1950s, argued that, while the damage caused by the fire to the steel walls protecting the hull may have hastened the disaster, the blaze was not the decisive factor. “When the Titanic hit the iceberg close to midnight on April 14, 1912, it created a    line of damage on the starboard section of the hull, including punctures and gashes, that opened up too many compartments to the sea, so that the weight of the water dragged the bow down so low that the ship eventually sank,” he said. “A fire may have accelerated this. But in my view, the Titanic would have sunk anyways. ” He added: “It amazes me how this ship still captures the global imagination. It was not the   catastrophe at sea. But it is the one everyone remembers. ”": "17378",
    "A father and son have been jailed for selling unsafe DIY   kits that left some users with bleeding gums from chemical burns.  The family business made more than £3m over a decade and meant Matthew Hargreaves, 44, and his father, John, 69, could live a lavish lifestyle.  But Merthyr crown court in south Wales was told that their products contained dangerously high levels of hydrogen peroxide, which can be used as a bleaching agent.  Father and son were each jailed for 18 months. John Hargreaves’ wife, Jean, 71, who was also involved in running the business, was jailed for six months but her sentence was suspended for two years.  An investigation, codenamed Operation Gleam, began when trading standards officers from Powys county council came across a company trading at the Royal Welsh Show in Builth Wells in the summer of 2013.  Advertising banners claimed the product was “ideal for any age group” and was “used by leading dentists throughout the UK and Europe”.  Officers bought a sample of the product and were shocked to find it contained up to 110 times the allowable level of hydrogen peroxide.  They issued a public warning that DIY kits which breached safety laws could aggravate gum disease or even cause chemical burns to the mouth.  The investigation, which cost more than £800, 000, spread across the UK, with officers speaking to dozens of people who had used the product.  Matthew and John Hargreaves admitted fraud. Jean Hargreaves admitted engaging in unfair commercial practice.  Mark Wyeth QC, prosecuting, said: “Their activities caused serious harm to unwitting members of the public. It involved the sale of unsafe and dangerous   products across the British Isles and Republic of Ireland. “They ran a thoroughly dishonest and dangerous business placing members of the public in serious harm for a period of eight years. ” The court heard the three lived in a large house in Cheshire and had seven luxury cars.  Whenever the pressure from trading standards or complaining customers became too great, the existing company would be wound up and another one, which was already set up, would take over. They have refused to say where the product came from.  Judge Philip   told the defendants they had shown blatant disregard for public safety in order to make a huge profit. “You placed personal greed before greater public safety. ” Clive Jones, Powys council’s lead for trading standards and community safety, said: “We will be working with the General Dental Council (GDC) on future campaigns as we need to ensure that such sharp practices are stamped out. ” Katie Spears, of the General Dental Council, said: “The GDC continue to work hard to proactively spread the message that tooth whitening is the practice of dentistry and that only registered dental professionals can legally and safely provide such treatment. “We are particularly proud of the collaborative approach taken here with Powys trading standards to promote patient safety and will continue to work with trading standards and other stakeholders to guard against the promotion of potentially dangerous illegal   practices. ”": "153919",

    "Following last year’s protests, the University of Missouri has seen a 20% decline in freshman enrollment for its incoming class, and is now operating with a $32 million deficit. As a result, the Interim Chancellor of the University has sent out a letter detailing their recovery strategy in response to the controversy. [The protests, which were aimed at University System President Tim Wolfe and the administration’s alleged mishandling of several racial incidents on campus, became the focus of several national news stories. According to the protesters, several racial incidents spanning across the last five years were ignored by the university, even though the movement’s admits that many of these incidents occurred  . They collectively put together a list of demands, one of which was a call for Wolfe’s resignation.  Immediately following the resignation of both the University System President and Chancellor, a video of University of Missouri Professor Melissa Click calling for the physical removal of a student photographer on assignment for ESPN quickly spread around the web. Click was charged with misdemeanor assault as a result of her exchange with the photographer. Even though a letter signed by 100 faculty members in defense of Click was presented to the administration, she was ultimately terminated by the university on February 25th. She is currently suing the university claiming wrongful termination.  The protests came under significant criticism after its leaders were forced to admit that claims that the KKK had been sighted on campus were false. Payton Head, student government president, and a figurehead on the movement was forced to apologize in a statement where he said he “was sorry about the misinformation that [he had] shared through social media. ” Major Brian Weimer of the university’s police department cleared any confusion by confirming that “there is no Ku Klux Klan on campus. ” Recently, an anonymous student at the University penned an open letter critical of the movement and its “eleven members” claiming that the protests have jeopardized the reputation of the University without legitimate purpose. The movement claims to represent the voices of “every Black student admitted to the University of Missouri since [1950] however they have “failed and continue to fail to find other points of view within the group of people [they] supposedly represent.

    "MOUNT VERNON, Va.  —   The costumed characters at George Washington’s gracious estate here are used to handling all manner of awkward queries, whether about   privies or the first president’s teeth. So when a visitor recently asked an     in a full skirt and head scarf if she knew Ona Judge, the woman didn’t miss a beat. Judge’s escape from the presidential residence in Philadelphia in 1796 had been “a great embarrassment to General and Lady Washington,” the woman said, before offering her own view of the matter. “Ona was born free, like everybody,” she said. “It was this world that made her a slave. ” It’s always 1799 at Mount Vernon, where more than a million visitors annually see the property as it was just before Washington’s death, when his will famously freed all 123 of his slaves. That liberation did not apply to Ona Judge, one of 153 slaves held by Martha Washington. But Judge, it turned out, evaded the Washingtons’ dogged (and sometimes illegal) efforts to recapture her, and would live quietly in New Hampshire for another 50 years. Now her story  —   and the challenge it offers to the notion that Washington somehow transcended the seamy reality of slaveholding  —   is having its fullest airing yet. Judge is among the 19 enslaved people highlighted in “Lives Bound Together: Slavery at George Washington’s Mount Vernon,” the first major exhibition here dedicated to the topic. She is also the subject of a book, “Never Caught: The Washingtons’ Relentless Pursuit of Their Runaway Slave, Ona Judge,” by Erica Armstrong Dunbar. Most scholars who have written about Judge’s escape have used it as a lens onto Washington’s evolving ideas about slavery. But “Never Caught,” published on Tuesday by 37 Ink, flips the perspective, focusing on what freedom meant to the people he kept in bondage. “We have the famous fugitives, like Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass,” Ms. Dunbar, a professor of black studies and history at the University of Delaware, said in an interview in Mount Vernon’s    food court. “But decades before them, Ona Judge did this. I want people to know her story. ” Research on slavery has exploded in the two decades since Mount Vernon, Monticello and other founder home sites introduced   tours and other prominent acknowledgments of the enslaved. “Lives Bound Together,” which runs through September 2018, was originally going to fill one    room in the museum here, but soon expanded to include six other galleries normally dedicated to the decorative and fine arts, books and manuscripts. “We had so much material, and it’s such an important story,” Susan P. Schoelwer, the curator at Mount Vernon, said. “We realized we could take many of the objects already on view and reframe them. ” The exhibition makes it clear just who poured from the elegant teapots and did the backbreaking work on the   estate. But integrating the harsh reality of slavery into the heroic story of Washington  —   “a leader of character,” as the title of the permanent exhibition across from the slavery show calls him  —   remains unfinished work, some scholars say. “He’s a much more mythic figure than Jefferson,” said Annette   the author of “The Hemingses of Monticello” and a Harvard professor. “Many people want to see him as perfect in some way. ” But his determined pursuit of Judge, she said, as much as his will freeing his slaves, reflects the basic   of slave owners. “It’s saying, ‘Whatever I might think about slavery in the abstract, I should be able to do what I want with my property,’” she said. Ms. Dunbar, the author of “Never Caught,” first came across Ona Judge in the late 1990s, when she was a graduate student at Columbia researching free black women in Philadelphia. One day in the archives, she noticed a 1796 newspaper ad offering $10 for the return of “a light Mulatto girl, much freckled, with very black eyes and bushy hair” who had “absconded” from the president’s house. “I said to myself: ‘Here I am, a scholar in this field. Why don’t I know about her? ’” Ms. Dunbar recalled. Since then, Judge’s story has inspired several children’s books, and even an episode of “Drunk History. ” But “Never Caught” is the first   nonfiction account, drawing on some newly unearthed sources to track her from Mount Vernon to New York City, Philadelphia and then New Hampshire, at a time when gradual abolition left the line between slavery and freedom ambiguous. “There’s a myth of the North as free, but her story shows how complicated that was,” Ms. Dunbar said. It is in the meticulous ledgers of Mount Vernon that we first see Ona Maria Judge, who was born around 1773 to an enslaved mother and a father who was a white indentured servant. At age 9 she was brought to live in the mansion house, eventually becoming Martha Washington’s personal maid. When Washington became president, Judge followed the first couple to New York and then Philadelphia, home to a growing free black community. Free blacks, Ms. Dunbar writes, aided Judge’s escape in the midst of a presidential dinner, after she had learned that she was to be given to Martha Washington’s granddaughter, Eliza. And it was free blacks who helped her catch a sailing ship to Portsmouth, N. H. where she married, had three children and lived on the edge of poverty, laboring in households far less exalted than the Washingtons’. In two interviews published in abolitionist newspapers shortly before her death in 1848, Judge testified to the desire for freedom that drove her to run away from the Washington household, where she had “never received the least moral or mental instruction,” she said. Judge’s story, Ms. Dunbar said, explodes any notion of “privileged” house slaves, or of the benevolence of the Washingtons, whose far from passive role in perpetuating slavery  —   and in doling out sometimes brutal punishment to the rebellious  —   is described in detail. Ms. Dunbar describes how the Washingtons quietly maneuvered around Pennsylvania’s 1780 gradual abolition law, rotating their slaves in and out of the state every six months. And she recounts their shock at the “ingratitude” of Judge, who fled “without any provocation,” the president wrote. After hearing that Judge was in Portsmouth, Washington, offering a story that she had been “enticed away by a Frenchman,” discreetly sent a federal customs officer to bring her back, circumventing procedures laid out in the 1793 fugitive slave law he himself had signed. When Judge agreed to return on condition that she be freed on Martha’s death, George Washington dismissed her demand as “totally inadmissible. ” However much he might favor general emancipation, he wrote to the customs officer, granting Judge any say in her fate would only “reward unfaithfulness” and give ideas to others “far more deserving of favor. ” In August 1799, Washington, through another associate, tried again to capture her, but was foiled when Judge received a tip about the plot and disappeared. Four months later Washington was dead, freeing all his slaves in his will. Judge and the others held by Martha Washington remained her legal property. Ms. Dunbar calls Washington’s act “no small thing,” but does not see the former president, who had no biological children to disinherit, as the hero of the story. “When it was safe, he emancipated his slaves,” she said. “He dealt with it after his death. And you know what? That’s what all the founders did with slavery: They kicked the can down the road. ”": "18344",

    "President Trump on Tuesday called for a government shutdown later this year and suggested the Senate might need to prohibit future filibusters, threatening to fracture Washington’s basic underpinnings to make progress on his legislative goals. His latest outbursts  —   no sitting president has called for the government to be shut down like this  —   could cast a shadow over how Congress approaches numerous bills this year. Trump wants Congress to overhaul the tax code, approve a $1 trillion infrastructure package and raise or suspend the debt ceiling before the government begins falling behind on its obligations. He has made little legislative progress in any of these areas, and he is on the verge of being dealt another stinging defeat as House Republicans splinter on a   bill for the second time in recent weeks. Trump’s new threats suggest he will jettison attempts at compromise and instead use the bombastic partisan warfare he employed during his campaign. The threats come after White House officials said they were furious at what they viewed as gloating by Democrats over the terms of a   spending bill that funds government operations through Sept. 30. In morning Twitter posts, Trump said he had to make concessions because Senate rules require 60 votes to pass legislation and Republicans control only 52 seats in the   chamber.  [Congress reaches deal to keep government open through September]        (Reuters)   He wrote that Republicans needed to pick up more seats in the 2018 midterm elections or consider changing filibuster rules so that the Senate’s minority party cannot block bills. “Our country needs a good ‘shutdown’ in September to fix mess!” he wrote. Trump could easily trigger a partial government shutdown in October, by directing Republicans not to negotiate with Democrats or by refusing to sign a spending bill that Congress sends him for approval. White House Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said Tuesday that Congress needs to return to the practice of passing   appropriations bills and sending them to the White House for approval, not continuing the recent practice of lurching from one stopgap spending bill to the next. “This is a   president, and he’s going to change Washington, D. C.,” Mulvaney said. “And if it takes a shutdown, that’s what it’s going to take. ” Mulvaney added, though, that a shutdown was not “desirable,” seeming to break with the president. Mulvaney plans to release a   budget in   that is supposed to help lawmakers craft their 2018 budgets. He said he wants work on those spending bills to begin immediately.  [Video: Mulvaney defines a ‘good’ shutdown]  Timothy Naftali, a presidential historian at New York University, said Trump’s threat of a shutdown was “totally, totally, totally” unprecedented. He said the threat, coupled with talk of changing filibuster rules, was typical of Trump’s approach. “Really what he’s talking about is destroying congressional procedures to get his way,” Naftali said. “When he’s losing, he likes to flip the game board. ” The White House did win numerous concessions during the recent negotiations with Congress over the stopgap spending bill. Democrats agreed, for example, to $1. 5 billion in new money for border security and roughly $21 billion in new defense spending, two of Trump’s top priorities. But, Mulvaney said, Democrats tried to “spike the football” because they blocked new funding for a wall along the Mexico border. Despite the White House’s frustration, Trump’s suggestion that spending bills should be able to pass with a simple majority was quickly dismissed by numerous top Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( . ). And Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer ( . Y.) said he was “deeply disappointed” in Trump’s calls for a shutdown. “It is truly a shame that the president is degrading it because he didn’t get 100 percent of what he wanted,” Schumer said. He went on to quote a Rolling Stones song to make his point, adding, “You can’t always get what you want. ” Trump’s attacks Tuesday illustrate how he continues to take a defiant stand with Congress more than 100 days after taking office. Top White House officials are hopeful that he can reach a deal with lawmakers to overhaul the tax code later this year, but budget rules will make that difficult without Democratic support. Democrats have so shown no willingness to accept the   tax cuts that Trump proposed last week, imperiling another of his campaign promises. Sensing how difficult it is to cobble together legislative support, Trump in recent weeks has openly floated numerous approaches to build a political coalition. He has said he wants to package his tax plan with his infrastructure plan, package his   plan with his infrastructure plan, pursue his   plan first, pursue his tax plan first, and pursue them separately but at the same time. The last government shutdown, in 2013 when Republicans controlled Congress, lasted more than two weeks. During that partial shutdown, the Obama administration said that at one point 850, 000 federal employees were placed on “furlough,” or leave without pay. Many other federal employees continued to work but were not paid until the shutdown ended. In total, the furloughs accounted for 6. 6 million days of lost work. The lost productivity cost the government $2 billion, the Obama White House said at the time. Diplomatic meetings were canceled, and U. S. officials largely stopped traveling to conferences and events across the country. The processing of tax returns slowed, and many agencies begin operating with much smaller staffs. Many government functions, such as law enforcement and national security, continued, but national parks closed and economists say there was a sizable impact on the economy, particularly in the Washington area. Once government shutdowns end, the federal employees are typically repaid for the time they were on furlough. Many lawmakers from both parties agree that the way the government funds its operations is broken and does not allow agencies to plan or prioritize. But the stopgap system has remained in place because lawmakers have a hard time agreeing on spending levels for different programs. Steve Bell, a Republican former staff director of the Senate Budget Committee, said Trump’s call to shut down the government over the problem was merited and could lead to a breakthrough. “I don’t know anything other than a really dramatic statement that could fix this,” he said. But Republican Judd Gregg, a former senator from New Hampshire, said Trump was finally coming to grips with the major differences between finding success in Washington compared with the business world. “I get the sense they are beginning to realize this isn’t like building a building or opening a golf course,” Gregg said of the White House. “This is high politics, not   buildings, and the process is entirely different. The motivation is entirely different. ” Former senator Kent Conrad, a Democrat from North Dakota and like Gregg an   of the Senate Budget Committee, said Trump’s call for a shutdown shows how he refuses to adjust to his role as president. “We really need a president to reach higher and to set a positive tone of responsible leadership,” Conrad said. “That’s what the country desperately needs. ”": "207202",

Refugee Youth Service, which has worked in the Calais camp since November last year, said a lack of information and widespread misunderstanding about what will happen to them had led to many children disappearing. ”These are some of the most vulnerable children in the world, they have been let down time and time again,” said the charity’s   Ben Teuten said in a statement.  ”When they disappear we are extremely concerned that they will be preyed upon by traffickers and are unlikely to seek state support due to their treatment to date.” Earlier this month, the French authorities began moving about 1, 500 unaccompanied child migrants from the Jungle to reception camps across the country. Josie Naughton, who helped to set up another charity, Help Refugees, said many migrant children were frightened. ”Being placed somewhere that you don’t understand  —   where you don’t necessarily have access to translators or social workers  —   and not knowing how long you’ll be there, that triggers a natural instinct to take control of your own life,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Migrant children have two legal routes into Britain. One is under European Union rules that allow for children to be reunited with relatives already in the UK. The other is under the   Dubs amendment to the Immigration Act which allows the most   child refugees in Italy, Greece and France to be taken to the UK for sanctuary. Refugee Youth Service called on the French and British governments to provide clearer information to child migrants, and urged the authorities to report children as missing when they disappear from reception centers. A Home Office spokesperson told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by email that ”we have made significant progress in improving and speeding up the existing processes since the beginning of the year, but the primary responsibility for unaccompanied children in France lies with the French authorities”. French officials were not immediately available for comment.  (Reporting by Zoe Tabary @zoetabary, editing by Katie Nguyen.

    "The United States on Sunday called Russia’s action in Syria  ”barbarism,” not   while Moscow’s U. N. envoy said ending the war ”is almost an impossible task now” as Syrian government forces, backed by Moscow, bombed the city of Aleppo.  The United Nations Security Council met on Sunday at the request of the United States, Britain and France to discuss the escalation of fighting in Aleppo following the announcement on Thursday of an offensive by the Syrian army to retake the city. ”What Russia is sponsoring and doing is not   it is barbarism,” U. S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, told the   council.  ”Instead of pursuing peace, Russia and Assad make war. Instead of helping get   aid to civilians, Russia and Assad are bombing the humanitarian convoys, hospitals and first responders who are trying desperately to keep people alive,” Power said.  A Sept. 9 ceasefire deal between U. S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov aimed at putting Syria’s peace process back on track effectively collapsed on Monday when an aid convoy was bombed. ”In Syria hundreds of armed groups are being armed, the territory of the country is being bombed indiscriminately and bringing a peace is almost an impossible task now because of this,” Russian U. N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin told the council. Britain’s U. N. ambassador, Matthew Rycroft, said on Sunday the U. S. and Russian bid to bring peace to Syria ”is very, very near the end of its life and yes the Security Council needs to be ready to fulfill our responsibilities.” ”The regime and Russia have instead plunged to new depths and unleashed a new hell on Aleppo,” Rycroft told the council. ”Russia is partnering with the Syrian regime to carry out war crimes.” However, Russia is one of five   on the council, along with the United States, France, Britain and China. Russia and China have protected Syrian President Bashar  ’s government by blocking several attempts at council action. ”It is time to say who is carrying out those air strikes and who is killing civilians,” Power said. ”Russia holds a permanent seat on the U. N. Security Council. This is a privilege and it is a responsibility. Yet in Syria and in Aleppo, Russia is abusing this historic privilege.” As Syria’s U. N. Ambassador Bashar Ja’afari began addressing the council, Power, Rycroft and French U. N. Ambassador Francois Delattre walked out of the chamber, diplomats said. ”Any political solution can only be successful by providing the requisite conditions through intensified efforts to fight terrorism,” Ja’afari told the council. ”The real war on terrorism has never started yet. The advent of Syrian victory is imminent.” U. N. Syria mediator Staffan de Mistura briefed the council meeting on Sunday. He appealed to the council to come up with a way to enforce a cessation of hostilities in Syria.  ”I am still convinced that we can turn the course of events. We have proven this more than once before,” he said, adding that he would not quit trying to bring peace in Syria.  ”Any sign of me resigning would be a signal that the international community is abandoning the Syrians, and we will not abandon the Syrians, and neither will you,” he said.

    "This is one Broadway show that’s bound to have a very large costume budget: “Cher: The Musical. ” The pop icon tweeted a few years ago that she wanted to do a show about her life. She met with veteran musical theater writer Rick Elice to discuss some ideas. All went quiet, until this week. On Thursday, Elice will present the first draft of his script to the show’s producers  —   Jeffrey Seller, riding high these days on “Hamilton,” and the fabulously named Flody Suarez, an   television producer who persuaded Cher to do the musical in the first place. “They may pack me in a van and have me carted away when they see what I’ve done with her life,” says Elice. “Or I’ll start doing what [‘Gypsy’ writer] Arthur Laurents always said about musicals, ‘They don’t get written. They get rewritten.’ ” Elice is due to present his script to Cher herself on May 20, which happens to be her 70th birthday. “I’ll be sharing with Cher, if you will,” he says. Elice is determined not to do a standard biomusical, though he’s no slouch in that department. He and writer Marshall Brickman did pretty well with “Jersey Boys,” the Four Seasons bio that’s been running at the August Wilson Theatre since 2005. The problem with Cher, Elice says, is that her “life is so wildly documented. There is not much we don’t know about her. I was not a fanatical Cher fan, but when I started working on this show, I was surprised at how much I knew. ” Sources say the musical will take audiences through Cher’s life as a child, as the wife of Sonny Bono, and as the woman who finds success  —   and legendary status  —   on her own. Three different actresses will play her at these three points in her life. All will have long legs. At one point, there was talk of Cher appearing in the show at the very end as herself today, but I’m told that’s probably not going to happen. Her life is certainly big enough for a Broadway musical. The former Cherilyn Sarkisian LaPiere was born near Los Angeles, where her mother struggled to be an actress while waiting tables (shades of “Gypsy” here, I wonder? ). The family moved around a lot, and never had much money. At one point, Cher wound up in an orphanage (“Annie”? ). From an early age, Cher knew she wanted to be famous. She was working as a backup singer in Los Angeles when she met Sonny Bono, also a struggling singer, in 1962. They clawed their way to the top, eventually creating TV’s fabulous “The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour. ” That part of the musical could have shades of “Dreamgirls” about it. After the marriage ended in a bitter 1975 divorce, Cher reinvented herself, first as a solo singer, then as an actress. Her breakthrough on that front came when she appeared on Broadway in 1982’s “Come Back to the 5 and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean. ” Mike Nichols saw her and cast her in “Silkwood,” which began the next phase of her career: movie stardom. (  fact: “Jimmy Dean” was the only time Cher appeared on Broadway. But her close friend David Geffen at one point urged her to play Grizabella in “Cats,” which he produced with the Shuberts.) “Cher: The Musical”  —   that’s the working title only, people  —   will touch on all these aspects of her life, along with her hits: “I Got You Babe,” “Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves,” “Take Me Home,” “Believe,” “If I Could Turn Back Time. ” “So far, I’ve been working on this by myself  —   well, me and iTunes,” says Elice. He put the show aside last year to take care of his husband, the great Roger Rees, who was fighting brain cancer. Rees died in July 2015. Three months later, Cher called. She suggested they start working again and invited him to spend time with her in California. Says Elice: “I thought, if Roger were here, the first thing he’d say is, ‘Get on the plane and go to Cher’s house already!’ I mean, if you’re going to rejoin the human race, why not do it with Cher?”": "144602",
    "of State Hillary Clinton appears to have sought inside information on a potential European Union bailout as her    Marc Mezvinsky, speculated on defaulting Greek bonds in 2012 with CalPERS’ public pension cash as his hedge fund was getting wiped out. [Fox News reported late last week that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who served from January 21, 2009 and until stepping down on February 1, 2013 in advance of her run for president, sought “secret info on European Union bailout plans as [her]   ’s doomed hedge fund gambled on Greece. ”  A former Goldman Sachs broker, Mezvinsky formed the Eaglevale Partners hedge fund in October 2011 with two   Sachs partners. Eaglevale was incorporated in the secretive tax haven of the Cayman Islands in October 2011, then immediately named Goldman Sachs as its prime broker and banker. Eaglevale would raise $325 million from CalPERS and others through a “special arrangement” with Goldman Sachs to engage in a “global macro” strategy to seek profit from opportunities in “politically volatile situations. ” Goldman Sachs has donated $5 million to the Clinton Foundation paid Hillary Clinton $675, 000 in speaking fees was Hillary Clinton’s fourth largest contributor to her 2008 presidential campaign with $407, 850 and  —   via its employees  —   is the sixth largest contributor to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign with $466, 978 in donations. Goldman has an extremely dicey history of manipulating the value of Greek debt. To help the perpetually insolvent nation qualify to join the euro in 2001, Goldman set up derivative   swaps with “fictional interest rates. ” The structure allowed the Greek government to borrow another $10 billion in debt payable in U. S. dollars and Japanese yen by pretending the Greek treasury had an extra $1 billion in cash. After the European Union bailed out Greece in 2010 to prevent an international banking collapse, Goldman’s derivative activity was investigated by the U. S. Securities  Exchange Commission, according to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. The only “situation” Eaglevale seems to have invested in was buying distressed Greek bonds at big discounts. The hedge fund speculated that the European Union would protect bondholders, requiring Greece to slash health and welfare spending. The same month Mezvinsky started his hedge fund, Gary Gensler, chair of the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates hedge funds,   Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that a bailout by the European Central Bank could “turn market sentiment” in favor of Greek bonds. Gensler was former   of Corporate Finance at Goldman Sachs, is currently the Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign’s Chief Financial Officer, and expects to be named Secretary of Treasury if Hillary Clinton is elected President. According to   subpoenaed regarding her use of a   personal server while Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton “kept a sharp eye on intelligence assessing the chances of a bailout of the Greek central bank” in 2012. Robert Hormats, Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment from 2009 to 2013 and a former Vice Chairman of Goldman Sachs, shared an extensive   chain with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during the crisis about the possibility of bailing out Greece. Included   contained classified materials and internal State Department memos about the debt from the U. S. Ambassador to Greece. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton shared   about the Greek bond restructuring with husband Bill Clinton and    Marc Mezvinsky. The   were not produced under the original 2014 subpoena regarding the private server, because the State Department had deemed the communications “protected” government communications. The recently produced   also reveal that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was sharing “classified information” about how the German government viewed the prospects for a Greek bailout with Clinton Foundation consultant Sidney Blumenthal. Sharing such inside information with friends and family is a conflict of interest under the United States Office of Government Ethics and is grounds to be “disqualified from working on a particular Government matter. ” But more importantly, it may have been a violation of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 prohibition on inside trading. Eaglevale picked up $13 million from the CalPERS public employee pension fund in April 2012 to invest it in distressed Greek bonds. At the same time, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and Chelsea Clinton’s former boss Marc Lasry both bought Greek bonds. Despite all of the work by the U. S. State Department in favor of a bailout that would have been a home run for Greek bondholders, the German government opposed a blanket   and Greek bonds crashed even lower in price. It is believed that CalPERS suffered a 100 percent loss on its investment.": "40476",
    "I seem to have been writing articles about conservatism all my life. Not quite, but almost. The first such article for which I was paid appeared in print in 1969 in the Swinton Journal (which, not at all coincidentally, was the first magazine I ever edited.) The article had the uninviting title “The Direction of Conservatism,” and in it I advocated educational vouchers, road pricing, flexible exchange rates, and many other good things from the handbook of classical liberalism. It had quite an impact too. When a second article on flexible exchange rates appeared (“Set the Pound Free”  —   I had a gift for headlines) Edward Heath, then Tory leader, forbade all the MPs in the parliamentary party from even discussing the topic in the future. Poor Ted. After that it was almost inevitable that as prime minister he would himself introduce floating rates, as he did in an early   crisis. From the Swinton Journal I jumped onto the Daily Telegraph as a parliamentary   producing four comic weekday columns on the previous day’s proceedings in the House of Commons, from 1972 to 1979. In that capacity and later ones, I lived through the Heath revolution (followed swiftly by the Heath  ) the (Enoch) Powellite revolution (aborted) the Thatcherite revolution (blocked and delayed by “the Wets” in numerous petty rebellions) the eventual establishment of the Thatcher Terror, its overthrow after a decade by notables from the   leadership class, then the slow, grey disintegration of the party during the John Major interregnum, the long years of exile under the   usurpation, and, finally, Restoration! under the triumphant Tory banner of Modernization. And all that was before I arrived in America and National Review to encounter Buckleyites, Birchers, neos, paleos,   RINOs, and now Monty Trump’s Flying Circus. RELATED: How Should Conservatives Respond to the Age of Trump? It is possible, as some predict, that its present civil war over the Brexit referendum will finally break the Tory party’s tensile unity. The history of Toryism is full of party splits, realignments, breakaways, and mergers. If the Tories split on this occasion, they will likely pause, regroup, and reunify (perhaps joining with UKIP) as they have done in the past, and as the Canadian Conservatives did under the redoubtable Stephen Harper. Great political parties and great movements of ideas sometimes die, but they rarely fade away. They are tough old beasts that fight from the stomach as much as from the head. And they certainly never die of anything as ephemeral as shame. RELATED: No, Conservatism Isn’t Dying Out, But what will they survive as? Both Trump admirers (broadly defined) and Trump detractors (ditto) see Republican and conservative establishments reeling before a hostile takeover by an invasion of populist Vikings and Visigoths who have come from nowhere under the banners of “No Entitlement Reform” and “America First” nationalism. Peggy Noonan celebrates this Jonah Goldberg will resist it just short of in perpetuity. But the main truth here is that this invasion doesn’t come from outside. It is an invasion mainly of people who have been in the ranks of conservatism all along. It is understandable if most commentators haven’t fully grasped this, because the invasion is led by Donald Trump, who does come from outside both movement and party and who, as Camille Paglia noted in a very different context, makes a very fetching Viking (“bedecked with the phallic tongue of a violet Celtic floral tie . . . looking like a triumphant dragon on the thrusting prow of a long boat”  —   wow! ). But the more we look at who votes for The Donald, the more they look like people who have voted Republican in the past. As Michael Brendan Dougherty, echoed by Ross Douthat, points out, they may belong disproportionately to the working and   classes, but they also belong to the   sectors of those classes. (They were voting in GOP primaries, after all.) And if common observation counts for anything, it is the lower social end of the Republican electorate where conservative views are most often to be found (though less on finance, say, than on crime.) Rod Dreher made exactly this point as early as January when, disagreeing with NR’s “Against Trump” special issue, he noticed that on visits to his family and in talks with neighbors, they agreed with statements by Trump that he felt were not only absurd but also plainly  . Yet they believed themselves to be conservatives in good standing and regarded their own views (and Trump’s) as well within the canon. Moreover, they were conservatives in good standing  —   just not conservatives who met the particular criteria of conservatism required by, well, by people like me who think, argue, and write about these things all the time. And until “policy wonks” were suddenly confronted with the fact that street conservatives differed from them quite seriously on entitlements, immigration, and much else, we were perfectly happy to assume their support or, if we noticed these differences, to believe that they would come around when we explained things carefully. It turns out, however, that they not only had different views but that they rooted these views in a different set of moral values that were both morally decent and broadly conservative. They were astonished to find themselves denounced by us as betraying or abandoning conservatism. RELATED: What Now, Conservatives? Take entitlements. Conservative writers have long pointed out that the present structure of such payments is fiscally unsustainable, destructive of   unrelated to the contributions beneficiaries have paid in over years, likely to undermine the dependent —  worker ratio on which the entitlements depend, and much else. All that is true, and as Jonah rightly points out, people like us are paid to tell the truth, the most relevant truth here being that if something can’t go on, it won’t go on. Most suburban conservatives don’t see it that way, however, and in particular they distinguish morally between different kinds of transfer payments. As Rod Dreher found when talking to his father, they think that welfare payments going to idlers are quite different from Social Security payments going to retirees. In the first case, they reward vice   encourage dependency in the second, they are the return on their investment in America as hard workers, good providers, helpful neighbors, potential draftees, and patriotic citizens. RELATED: The GOP’s Ideological Earthquake and the Aftermath, Admittedly, retirees receive far more in Social Security payments than their accumulated contributions could justify in purely investment terms. Often they know that, but they believe on moral grounds that those Americans who built the country, played by the rules, and defended it in war should be last in the line for making sacrifices. In addition, they have been officially told for   of a century that they will be secure in old age, and so they have legitimate expectations as a result. What prevents these facts from amounting to a   argument is mathematics: The cost of entitlements enjoyed by millions is higher than most other sorts of federal spending. So the    battle, refracted through political principles, becomes a clash between two conservative values: honest accounting and moral desert. There can’t be a knockout victory for either principle in a decent stable society. So if legitimate expectations have to be disappointed, that can only be as part of something like what James C. Bennett and Michael J. Lotus in America 3. 0 call the “Big Haircut,” in which all social groups sacrifice something in a grand fiscal compromise. Nothing like that will occur until a great deal of persuasion (from, among others, conservative wonks) has occurred, until   bargaining has taken place among all social groups and their political representatives, and until the sense of crisis is much more acute, spreading even to Democratic politicians. Those things will not happen for at least a decade. Many of today’s retirees will then be dead. So the slogan “protect entitlements” is a reasonable one both before and during any “Big Haircut” negotiations and any compromise outcome should and will reflect the conservative moral distinctions that at present underpin popular support for entitlements. Finally, most conservative intellectuals  —   excluding   libertarians  —   will probably accept such a measured approach as the best practical solution in an imperfect political economy. In other words, we Big Think merchants will end up not very far from these dangerous intruders who are stealing our party. Share article on FacebookshareTweet Another group of alleged invaders are   nationalists. It’s been a surprise to me to discover that nationalists are not conservatives in good standing, since they used to be the third leg of the conservative tripod, alongside social and economic conservatives. Some years ago when no one was looking, however, this tripod underwent a transplant, and national conservatives were quietly replaced by “defense conservatives. ” That is an absurdly thin and tepid concept (unless you happen to be a defense contractor, in which case the concept becomes a fat and passionate one). It probably reflects the nervousness of mainstream parties and moderate politicians about the full range of national conservative issues that include, as well as foreign policy and defense, crime, multiculturalism,   social disorder, and immigration. RELATED: After the GOP Darkness, the Dawn of Conservative Opportunity, National conservatism has a domestic concern for the social fabric as well as an   one for the national interest. (Indeed, I once suggested “  conservatives” as an alternative to national conservatives.) But because it takes a critical or skeptical view of leftist positions on crime, multiculturalism, etc. it is likely to invite accusations of racism, xenophobia, and much else from the very same leftists. These accusations apparently paralyze thought. For very few conservative politicians have shown enough savvy to reply that an accusation of white racism requires more evidence than that the person accused is white. Instead they remain more or less quiescent, avoiding controversy, in the face of mob violence to shut down political opponents and openly racist campaigns to delegitimize the police. All of these are matters of acute personal concern to ordinary Americans of all races, since they will be the ones who suffer if the social fabric shreds. In the aftermath of the Ferguson riots, there are signs that the police are holding back from proactively enforcing the law (that, is from taking the “broken windows” approach) thereby enabling a serious rise in urban crime. Regular Americans, especially ordinary conservatives, are increasingly anxious as the crime and disorder spread and as the Democrats almost flagrantly refuse to confront either the evils themselves or their political allies who are pushing them. Not only, therefore, is the salience of domestic “nationalist”     issues rising with everyday conservatives it is also forging a link between them and conservative intellectuals. Heather Mac Donald, one of the most effective national conservatives writing today, was almost alone for some time in reporting and analyzing the   campaign against the police. Others, at NR and elsewhere, have come to follow her lead. Michael Barone noticed an eerie similarity between the 1960s and ’70s and today: In both periods, liberals discussed crime and other social evils almost wholly in terms of white racism, and partly as a result they lost every election from 1968 to 1992 (with the exception of 1976.) The political impact he highlighted is prompting others to look again at these issues as potential  . And immigration, the issue that Trump exploited as the   of his campaign, demonstrates that these national issues are reshaping conservative and Republican politics in an unexpected way. Until recently there have been two political platitudes on this topic: that immigration divided the conservative grassroots from the GOP donor class and national leadership, and that this division was mimicked by a lesser split, within the conservative intelligentsia, between those who were more and those were less in favor of “open borders. ” In fact, the split in the conservative intelligentsia has been gradually resolving itself in favor of those who favor a smaller intake of   migrants. That position, adopted by NR in 1991 and held by us ever since, is now the dominant position on the intellectual right. It unites the national voters in the wider electorate with most writing conservatives. RELATED: Does a Conservative Reformation Loom on the Horizon? What the primary campaign did was to isolate in public view those who were committed to oppose any serious control of   immigration (and, by extension, to oppose the conservative position on other   issues)  —   namely, the donor class, the party leadership, the Chamber of Commerce conservatives, and, for months of the campaign, all the candidates except Trump who were unbelievably slow in responding to electoral incentives (i. e. votes) rather than financial ones (i. e. donations.) They are exposed as representing a narrow set of economic interests  —   essentially corporate America in libertarian camouflage  —   and offering social and national conservatives rhetorical slogans rather than practical reforms. In effect, they wanted a tripod resting on one leg. And they fell. What made their fall all but inevitable was that they were selfish, narrow, and unimaginative in their policy thinking  —   fighting for   immigration and repeating outdated slogans (‘the party of Jack Kemp”) rather than thinking about how to redesign opportunities for the new world of automation, family enterprises, independent contracting, and desktop industrialization. (See Bennett and Lotus again, and, in the Australian journal I edit, “Populism Rising,” by Peter Murphy.) RELATED: What Has Conservatism Ever Done for Us? A Great Deal, Actually, And it wasn’t a true fall, either, but a temporary loss. They have lost a nearly monopoly control of the GOP (and to a lesser extent, control of the definition of conservatism) not to invaders from outside but to conservative Republicans who suddenly started voting for their opinions rather than for their incumbents. In fact there are far fewer “invaders” (from the   segments of the working class) than I and most other commentators believed at the start of his campaign. That may change, but what we are currently seeing is less a takeover by outsiders than a “reunification” of the party as its disillusioned supporters were suddenly given hope that they might be heard once again. That’s not the best news for the GOP electorally, but it offers the prospect that a   GOP will find it easier either to govern or to rethink. More Conservatism The shocking speed of entrenchment, c. Civil Asset Forfeiture: Where Due Process Goes to DieA Conservative Brain (and Excellent Teacher) All of these reflections are prompted not by Trump but by those who voted for him  —   and no less by those who voted for Cruz. Both men led revolutions and both attracted significant levels of support. Between them, they won   of the votes on the right. Both will influence the GOP in the next decade or two. Those who despair of the effect that Trump’s nomination will have on the GOP should consider a few simple points. A presidential nominee only borrows his party until the election. If he loses the election, he loses the party, too. If he wins the election but is a failure  —   and the odds are stacked against the possibility that a candidate such as Trump, without the full support of his party, could succeed as president  —   he loses the party a little later. If he wins the election and has a successful presidency, he probably reshapes the party in his own image.

    "Brazil’s government has sharply increased spending in local infrastructure projects proposed by lawmakers, according to budget data reviewed by Reuters on Tuesday, as a graft scandal threatens to topple President Michel Temer. Federal spending on infrastructure works and other projects this year sponsored by congressman for their constituencies jumped to 1. 49 billion reais ($451 million) in June, up from 959 million reais the month before, the data showed.  As Brazil grapples with   budget deficits, the recent splurge illustrates Temer’s efforts to keep his fragmented coalition united despite growing calls for his resignation more than one year before general elections.   Temer’s office declined to comment on the increase in spending in the past month. Brazilian legislators can earmark the federal budget for local works, but the federal government must authorize that spending.  Brazil’s budget deficit before interest payments soared to 30. 736 billion reais ($9. 30 billion) in May, the   for the month. The gap in the 12 months through May reached 157. 7 billion reais, above the official target for a deficit of 143. 1 billion reais for this year. The increase in spending comes at a time when Temer is facing charges with taking millions of dollars in bribes in connection with a graft scheme involving the world’s largest meatpacker, JBS SA. Company executives said in   testimony that the president took bribes for resolving tax matters, freeing up loans from   banks and other matters. According to the testimony, Temer also allegedly arranged to receive a total of 38 million reais from JBS.  The president has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.   VOTE ON TEMER’S FATE Under Brazilian law, it is now up to the lower house of Congress to decide if the president will be tried by the Supreme Court.   of the lower house must vote to approve the charge for that to happen. Temer’s charge will first be voted on by the   Constitution and Justice Committee, which on Tuesday evening chose deputy Sergio Zveiter, from the president’s own Brazilian Social Democracy Party, to be the rapporteur for the case. Zveiter vowed to be independent and beholden ”only to the country.” The commission’s vote is expected by July 13.  Regardless of the commission’s decision, the full house must still vote on the charge against Temer. That full vote is expected to take place on July 14.             Rodrigo Janot last week said he would likely level new charges of racketeering and obstruction of justice against Temer in the coming weeks. Each charge would require lawmakers to vote on whether to defend the deeply unpopular president from being tried. Lawmakers within Temer’s coalition are confident they have the votes to block the   majority required to proceed with a trial.

    "I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. Updated on April 27 at 2:05 p. m. ET, Describing the   Republican speaker of the House as a “serial child molester,” a federal judge in Chicago sentenced Dennis Hastert to 15 months in prison on Wednesday for lying to investigators and evading federal banking regulations as part of a scheme to cover up   sexual abuse. Judge Thomas Durkin also imposed two years’ supervised release, a $250, 000 fine, and attendance in a   treatment program. Hastert faced five years in prison for the charges under federal sentencing guidelines. Prosecutors had requested a maximum of six months, while the former politician’s defense team asked for probation, citing his age, 74, and health woes. Before entering politics, Hastert taught high school in Illinois and coached a wrestling team between 1965 and 1981. At least four members of the team have now accused him of sexually abusing them one of them filed a lawsuit for $1. 8 million in compensation on Monday. The court heard stunning testimony during the hearing from Scott Cross, previously known as “Individual D” in court filings, before the judge handed down his sentence. Cross testified publicly for the first time that Hastert molested him decades earlier as a teenager. “As a 17 year old boy, I was devastated,” he told the court. “I felt intense pain, shame, and guilt. ” “I don’t remember doing that, but I accept his statement,” Hastert said when asked about Cross’s allegations during Wednesday’s hearings. Scott’s brother, Tom Cross, served as the Illinois House GOP leader for 11 years and was a political protégé of Hastert during his political career. According to the Chicago Tribune, Hastert asked his former friend and ally to write a letter of support for his sentencing he received no response. Hastert has not faced criminal charges for the acts, which now fall outside the statute of limitations. None of the acts occurred during his   career in the U. S. House of Representatives. The court also heard from Jolene Burdge, whose brother, Stephen Reinboldt, had told her about repeated instances of abuse. He died of   complications in 1995. From the stand on Wednesday, she demanded Hastert admit what he had done to her brother and “tell the truth. ” Hastert addressed the court last and apologized for “mistreating athletes. ” When Durkin pointedly asked him whether he had sexually abused them, Hastert simply answered, “Yes. ” The    former politician’s downfall came not from the allegations of sexual abuse themselves, but from his efforts to cover them up: In or about 2010, according to the indictment, Hastert —  a former   teacher and coach —  met with an unnamed individual from Yorkville, Hastert’s hometown. They “discussed past misconduct by defendant against Individual A that had occurred years earlier. ” In effect, Hastert fell victim to blackmail, the indictment alleges: He “agreed to provide Individual A $3. 5 million in order to compensate for and conceal his prior misconduct against Individual A. ” (Since leaving the House, Hastert has become a highly paid lobbyist.) [  …    ] After the 2010 meeting with Individual A, Hastert allegedly began withdrawing cash from his bank accounts to pay to the individual. But federal laws require financial institutions to report transactions greater than $10, 000, and Hastert made a series of them. In April 2012, the indictment alleges, employees of Hastert’s bank questioned him about the withdrawals, and he promptly reduced his withdrawals to smaller amounts, to escape the requirement. Authorities were already watching, however, and they began investigating Hastert for structuring currency transactions to evade federal requirements —  itself a crime. Federal prosecutors indicted Hastert last May for lying to FBI agents and evading banking regulations on cash withdrawals. He pled guilty in October.             Like this?

    "The writing is on the wall when it comes to the University of Wisconsin’s stance on ” ” graffiti, but some students and faculty reportedly sided with the alleged vandal instead of the law.   Campus police last week capped a   investigation into a wave of graffiti, arresting a senior as he sat in   Studies class at the Madison campus. The messages he allegedly   around campus, which included ”    the Police,” cost $4, 000 to clean up, according to police. ”Graffiti is criminal vandalism and we act on these crimes regardless of the content,” said campus Police Chief Susan Riseling. The police chief did apologize for disruption caused by the arrest of Denzel McDonald, but said in a statement that efforts to apprehend him outside of class were unsuccessful and that officers did not realize class had begun. But McDonald’s supporters on campus were upset that he was arrested at all, according to Inside Higher Ed. “The university is more interested in protecting the symbols of UW as a progressive institution, like their buildings and (mascot) Bucky, rather than the students who are actually fighting for social change, and apparently their lives,” Professor Johanna Almiron,  whose class was interrupted by the arrest, said in a letter of protest signed by 700 students and faculty. “The way UWPD officers entered my class was very aggressive, with bulletproof vests and guns visible. I cannot believe they humiliated and terrified my students. ” The 11 messages McDonald allegedly spray painted around campus also included, “Racizm in the air. Don’t  ” and “White supremacy is a disease. ”   McDonald was subsequently arrested on 11 preliminary counts of vandalism and one count of disorderly conduct, for allegedly threatening to kill someone who saw him painting the graffiti. Prosecutors have not yet formally charged McDonald, who has been released on bail. Almiron and other faculty members have asked that McDonald be “given immunity from expulsion,” and called the police response to the graffiti overzealous.

    "(CNN) A Latino surrogate for the Trump campaign warned Thursday that without tighter immigration policies from the Republican presidential nominee, ”you’re going to have taco trucks on every corner.” Latinos for Trump founder Marco Gutierrez’s comments came while he was defending Donald Trump’s immigration position to MSNBC’s   Reid. ”My culture is a very dominant culture. And it’s imposing, and it’s causing problems. If you don’t do something about it, you’re going to have taco trucks on every corner,” Gutierrez said. Moments before, Gutierrez had argued that ”the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few” and that ”we need to understand that this is a different time and we’re having different problems” regarding illegal immigration. Trump’s campaign did not respond to a CNN request for comment. The Trump supporter’s comment about ”taco trucks” sparked backlash and mockery on social media, with the hashtag #tacotrucksoneverycorner trending on Twitter throughout the night.  ”Hey, what’s wrong with #TacoTrucksOnEveryCorner?! Use my Evamoji for the taco truck! #Evamoji” actress and activist Eva Longoria wrote on Twitter, including an image of taco truck. Hillary Clinton’s campaign also joined in, with spokesman Brian Fallon tweeting, ”(Clinton campaign manager) Robby Mook  Team Brooklyn is fired up for #TacoTrucksOnEveryCorner.” Immigration policy has been at the center of the Trump campaign’s messaging over the last week, as the Republican nominee made a   trip to Mexico to meet with President Enrique Peña Nieto. Trump followed that up the same day with a major speech on his immigration position, intended to clarify a stance that had become muddled as the candidate vacillated between ”softening” his policy and maintaining the hardline policies he’d touted during the primary.": "57401",
    "(CNN) When Andrea Hood saw the window, she knew it might be her only chance to survive. ”The Hunt With John Walsh” airs Sundays at 9 p. m.   on CNN. Got a tip? Call     (In Mexico: 0188000990546) or click here. Abducted two days earlier by two men she didn’t know, the    had spent most of the previous 48 hours chained to a bed in a room with a barred window. Held captive, she was tortured and raped repeatedly. But on a trip to the bathroom, she spotted another window, this one without bars.   ”That was my first bit of hope, like, ’Oh, I can maybe get out,’” Hood said of the moment on CNN’s ”The Hunt with John Walsh.” Her captors had wanted her to read a book about subservient women. She told them she would, and they unchained one of her hands to turn the pages. Left alone, she quickly freed her arm and other legs, grabbed one of the many firearms around the house and ran for the window, for freedom. She smashed the window with the gun, climbed through the broken glass and started running. ”One of the guys was yelling, ’Get her, get her, she can’t get away!’ ” Hood said.  ”I ran down the street hysterically crying, and bleeding all over. I was scared that they were literally right behind me.” CNN’s John Walsh believes Hood’s decisive action that night may be the reason she’s alive today. ”Here’s a vulnerable    girl that was smart enough, tough enough, had the presence of mind to say, ’I’m going to stay alive. I’m going to look for that chance,’ and that’s what saved her life,” he said. Inside the torture house, Hood found her way to the police and learned she was in Hillsboro, Oregon, 17 miles west of Portland, where she had been picked up by the men two days earlier.  It was 1990. Hood had been working as a prostitute on the streets of Portland to pay for her drug habit. It was around 2 or 3 in the morning when the men pulled up in a small pickup truck. ”Before I knew what was even happening, I was in the back of the truck, chained to the bed of the truck, and with a pillowcase on my head and duct tape on my mouth,” Hood told ”The Hunt.” Now she had been treated for her injuries, and was driving around with law enforcement, leading them back to the torture house she had escaped only hours earlier. There, the police found the broken window with the rifle Hood used to break it outside on the ground. Inside, they discovered more evidence supporting her account, including Polaroid photos of other women in bondage, as well as photos of Hood. After searching the Hillsboro house, police arrested the home’s owner, Vance Roberts, and his   Paul Jackson. That night, the pair had driven their pickup truck to a hospital, where Roberts received medical attention for a cut on his arm. In his version of events, Hood had been trying to steal from them, which is why she jumped out the window and how Vance got his injury. The photos? Old girlfriends, he claimed. A previous victim steps forward, To this day, many of the other women in those photos have not been located or identified. One has: Michaelle Dierich. Like Hood, she was a Portland prostitute with a drug habit.  Two years before Hood’s ordeal, Dierich went through almost the same experience: abducted by two men in a pickup truck, chained up in a closet, sexually tortured and brutalized for days. After a week of this treatment, the younger man threw a hood over her head again and put her back in the truck.  Dierich assumed they were planning to kill her. Instead, she was dropped off on a street in Portland. Dierich went to the hospital and was interviewed by police. She filled out a report and submitted a rape kit. But she could not tell them where she’d been taken, or by whom.  Lacking enough evidence to launch a detailed investigation, the report was filed away and nothing else happened    until Hood’s case came to light. The Hillsboro police found Dierich with the help of the Portland police. She identified Roberts and Jackson as her abductors from 1988. Armed with two witnesses and hard evidence, prosecutors charged the brothers with kidnapping and rape.  A trial date was set, but in February 1991, Roberts and Jackson, who were free on bond, fled. Roberts returns to face justice, In September 2006, after 15 years on the run, Vance Roberts unexpectedly walked into the Washington County Jail and turned himself in.  He claimed to have been living under bridges in Portland, but police didn’t believe his story.  They were unsuccessful in getting any more information from him.  At his trial, Roberts insisted the women had stayed with him voluntarily.   Hillsboro sergeant Bruce Parks recalled the trial: ”The defense tried to victimize the two women. They may have committed a small crime by working on the street as a prostitute, but they never agreed to be kidnapped. They’re still human beings.” The jury didn’t buy it, and after finding Roberts guilty, sentenced him to 108 years in prison.  Hood said she feels vindicated by the verdict. ”[H]e gets to spend the rest of his life in a situation of subservience. He’s told when to use the bathroom, when to eat, what he can do, just like they had planned for me, and I felt like that was just.” On the day of the sentencing, Dierich took the stand and confronted Roberts about the women in the photos whose identities and whereabouts are still unknown.  ”You brutalized me you terrorized me. You left me mentally and emotionally crippled beyond words or expression.   ”It wasn’t just me, though. Indeed there were many other victims, more victims than we may know about today.  ”Everybody knows about the 10 other victims. So, I’d like to know where their bodies at?” The hunt for Paul Jackson, Since his return in 2006, Vance Roberts has never turned on his brother, or said anything about Paul Jackson’s whereabouts.  Jackson is still on the run, 23 years since he jumped bail.   Deputy U. S. Marshal John Moody hopes the exposure given to the case by CNN’s ”The Hunt” will bring forth new leads. ”The biggest thing that we’re looking for is someone to come forward that they’ve, maybe this has happened to them and they escaped from it,” he said. ”We’d like to hear from them. They may have a piece to the puzzle to get this creature off the streets.” Paul Jackson has a scar on his stomach from having his appendix removed. Jackson has lived in both Arizona and Hawaii and has a background in electronic and automotive work.

    "President Barack Obama broke his   silence on Thursday to deliver a statement celebrating the seventh anniversary of Obamacare, as House Republicans work to pass a plan that would replace it. [“So the reality is clear: America is stronger because of the Affordable Care Act,” he wrote in a statement over 600 words long.  Obama painted his bill as the culmination of progressive history, citing leaders of both parties since former President Theodore Roosevelt fighting for the cause of health care. “[U]ltimately, after a century of talk, decades of trying, and a year of bipartisan debate, our generation was the one that succeeded,” he wrote. “We finally declared that in America, health care is not a privilege for a few, but a right for everybody. ” The former president repeated many of the selling points he used seven years ago, arguing that thanks to his bill more Americans were insured and enjoyed the benefits of health insurance. Obama specifically disputed Speaker Paul Ryan’s claim that Obamacare was in a “death spiral” even though he admitted that some premiums went up instead of down, he argued that the “vast majority” of plans did not experience premium hikes. Read the full  statement below: Statement from President Barack Obama On the 7th Anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, When I took office, millions of Americans were locked out of our health care system. So, just as leaders in both parties had tried to do since the days of Teddy Roosevelt, we took up the cause of health reform. It was a long battle, carried out in Congressional hearings and in the public square for more than a year. But ultimately, after a century of talk, decades of trying, and a year of bipartisan debate, our generation was the one that succeeded. We finally declared that in America, health care is not a privilege for a few, but a right for everybody. The result was the Affordable Care Act, which I signed into law seven years ago today. Thanks to this law, more than twenty million Americans have gained the security and peace of mind of health insurance. Thanks to this law, more than ninety percent of Americans are insured  —   the highest rate in our history. Thanks to this law, the days when women could be charged more than men and Americans with   conditions could be denied coverage altogether are relics of the past. Seniors have bigger discounts on their prescription drugs. Young people can stay on their parents’ plans until they turn 26 years old. And Americans who already had insurance received an upgrade as well  —   from free preventive care, like mammograms and vaccines, to improvements in the quality of care in hospitals that has averted nearly 100, 000 deaths so far. All of that is thanks to the Affordable Care Act. And all the while, since the law passed, the pace of health care inflation has slowed dramatically. Prices are still rising, just as they have every year for decades  —   but under this law, they’ve been rising at the slowest rate in fifty years. Families who get coverage through their employer are paying, on average, thousands of dollars less per year than if costs kept rising as fast as they were before the law. And reality continues to discredit the false claim that this law is in a “death spiral,” because while it’s true that some premiums have risen, the vast majority of Marketplace enrollees have experienced no average premium hike at all. And so long as the law is properly administered, this market will remain stable. Likewise, this law is no “” because America’s businesses went on a   streak of job growth in the seven years since I signed it. So the reality is clear: America is stronger because of the Affordable Care Act. There will always be work to do to reduce costs, stabilize markets, improve quality, and help the millions of Americans who remain uninsured in states that have so far refused to expand Medicaid. I’ve always said we should build on this law, just as Americans of both parties worked to improve Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid over the years. So if Republicans are serious about lowering costs while expanding coverage to those who need it, and if they’re prepared to work with Democrats and objective evaluators in finding solutions that accomplish those goals  —   that’s something we all should welcome. But we should start from the baseline that any changes will make our health care system better, not worse for hardworking Americans. That should always be our priority. The Affordable Care Act is law only because millions of Americans mobilized, and organized, and decided that this fight was about more than health care  —   it was about the character of our country. It was about whether the wealthiest nation on Earth would make sure that neither illness nor twist of fate would rob us of everything we’ve worked so hard to build. It was about whether we look out for one another, as neighbors, and fellow citizens, who care about each other’s success. This fight is still about all that today. And Americans who love their country still have the power to change it.": "32502",
    "Alice Ollstein contributed reporting. For the last few months, House GOP moderates who have been uncomfortable with their party’s Obamacare repeal bill have had the raucous complaints of House conservative hardliners about the legislation to hide behind. But that shield has fallen, the hardliners are supporting the bill, and now it’s the votes of Republicans from purple and blue districts that determine the fate of the legislation. Those moderates are squirming under the new spotlight chasing them around the Capitol as reporters feverishly construct their own whip counts. Around 20 moderates have come out against the bill, and handfuls more have retreated into the undecided column. But unlike their House Freedom Caucus counterparts  —   who relished telling anyone who would listen their demands on Obamacare repeal  —   the GOP centrists are playing coy about where they stand on the bill and what it would take to move their vote. ”I don’t want to give a full press conference. I answered your question,” Rep. Kevin Yoder ( ) told TPM Monday evening after confirming tersely that he was undecided. Rep. Darrell Issa ( ) whose district voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, smiled like a Cheshire Cat as reporters grilled him Monday evening on where he stands on the bill. “I have commented many, many times about my undecided position,” he finally said. Rep. Michael Turner ( ) would only say that he was “busy” when a reporter asked him repeatedly Monday evening about his current stance. Last week a change to the legislation, the American Health Care Act, was unveiled, allowing states to opt out of certain Affordable Care Act insurer mandates. The amendment  —   hammered out by conservative hardliner leader Rep. Mark Meadows ( ) and prominent moderate Rep. Tom MacArthur ( )  —   quickly brought most of the House Freedom Caucus on board. For moderates, whose opposition to the original bill was more under the radar, supporting the proposal would put them in violation of a key promise many Republicans made in the repeal fight: that they would preserve Obamacare’s protections for Americans with   conditions. Under the new changes, consumers living in states that opted out of the ACA mandate known as community ratings for health status could face higher premiums for any   conditions. “We’re going to allow the states to go out there and make a determination for themselves what they want to do in terms of waiving programs. What does that literally mean for people with preexisting conditions? That’s what I need to figure out for myself,” Rep. Brian Mast ( ) told reporters coming out of Tuesday morning’s conference meeting. He is now undecided on the a bill, after previously giving a stirring speech encouraging members to vote for it the night before it was pulled from the floor in March. Top Republicans have said that they are closer than ever on passing the health care bill out of the House. But to get over the finish line, they have had to engage in a new round of  . Vice President Mike Pence was at the Capitol Monday afternoon, meeting with members wavering on the bill, such as Yoder and Rep. Mario   ( ).   played it cool coming out of the meeting. Asked if he was still undecided, he said he was focusing on the appropriations bill Congress will pass this week to fund the government, and wouldn’t elaborate on what Pence said to him about health care. The position moderates are in is a tough one: oppose the bill and be blamed for getting in the way of a   promise of the GOP or support it and put yourself at political risk regardless of whether the Senate passes it. Even before the latest changes, moderates were already feeling the pressure due to the bill’s massive cuts to Medicaid and phase out of the Medicaid expansion. The way the bill restructures the ACA’s tax credits for individual insurance —  making them more generous to young people at the expense of older consumers —  also puts some members in a pinch. The current dynamics have allowed some members to assert that more changes are negotiable on the bill, despite the signal from leadership that this is the version they want to move forward. Rep. Peter King ( ) stressed Tuesday morning that he “tend[s] to vote yes” but the current language probably wasn’t final. “If they don’t have the votes, then they’ll have to make changes,” King said.": "92353",
    "In San Francisco, a young engineer hopes to “optimise” his life through sensors that track his heart rate, respiration and sleep cycle. In Copenhagen, a bus running two minutes behind schedule transmits its location and passenger count to the municipal traffic signal network, which extends the time of the green light at each of the next three intersections long enough for its driver to make up some time. In Davao City in the Philippines, an unsecured webcam overlooks the storeroom of a fast food stand, allowing anyone to peer in on all its comings and goings. What links these wildly different circumstances is a vision of connected devices now being sold to us as the “internet of things”. The technologist Mike Kuniavsky, a pioneer of this idea, characterises it as a state of being in which “computation and data communication [are] embedded in, and distributed through, our entire environment”. I prefer to see it for what it is: the colonisation of everyday life by information processing. Though it can often feel as if this colonisation proceeds of its own momentum, distinct ambitions are being served wherever and however the internet of things appears. The internet of things isn’t a single technology. About all that connects the various devices, services, vendors and efforts involved is the end goal they serve: capturing data that can then be used to measure and control the world around us. Whenever a project has such imperial designs on our everyday lives, it is vital that we ask just what ideas underpin it and whose interests it serves. Although the internet of things retains a certain sprawling and formless quality, we can get a far more concrete sense of what it involves by looking at how it appears at each of three scales: that of our bodies (where the effort is referred to as the “quantified self”) our homes (“the smart home”) and our public spaces (“the smart city”). Each of these examples illuminates a different aspect of the challenge presented to us by the internet of things, and each has something distinct to teach us. At the most intimate scale, the internet of things is visible in the form of wearable biometric sensors. The simplest of these are little more than networked digital pedometers, which count steps, measure the distance a person has traversed, and furnish an estimate of the calories burned in the course of this activity. More elaborate models measure heart rate, breathing, skin temperature and even perspiration. If wearable biometric devices such as Fitbits and Apple Watches are, in theory, aimed at rigorous   the colonisation of the domestic environment by similarly networked products and services is intended to deliver a very different experience: convenience. The aim of such “smart home” efforts is to   the process of reflection that stands between having a desire and fulfilling that desire by buying something. Right now, the perfect example of this is a gadget being sold by Amazon, known as the Dash Button. Many    devices are little more than some conventional object with networked connectivity tacked on. The Dash Button is the precise opposite, a thing in the world that could not have existed without the internet. I cannot improve on Amazon’s own description of this curious object and how it works, so I’ll repeat it here: “Amazon Dash Button is a    device that reorders your favourite item with the press of a button. To use Dash Button, simply download the Amazon app from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Then, sign into your Amazon Prime account, connect Dash Button to   and select the product you want to reorder. Once connected, a single press on Dash Button automatically places your order. ” In other words:   electronic devices, each dedicated to an individual branded item, that you press when you’re running low. Pressing a Dash Button specific to your preferred pet food, washing powder or bottled water automatically composes an order request to Amazon for that one product. I don’t for a second want to downplay the value of such a product for people who have ageing parents to look after, or kids to drop off at daycare, or for whom simply getting in the car to pick up some cat food may take an hour or more out of their day. But the benefit to the individual customer is tiny compared with what Amazon gains. Sure, you never run out of cat food. But Amazon gets data on the time and place of your need, as well as its frequency and intensity, and that data has value. It is an asset, and you can be sure that Amazon will exploit it in every way its terms and conditions permit  —   including by using it to develop behavioural models that map our desires in high resolution, so as to target them with even greater efficiency in the future. Again, the aim of devices such as the Dash Button is to permit the user to accomplish commercial transactions with as little conscious thought as possible  —   not even the few moments it takes to tap out commands on the touchscreen of a phone or tablet. The data on what the industry calls “conversion” is as clear as it is unremitting: with every box to tick or form to fill, the percentage of users that make it all the way to checkout tumbles. The fewer steps there are in a transaction, the more likely people are to spend their money. Manufacturers, enticed by the revenue potential of conquering the domestic environment, keep trying to eliminate these steps, in the hope that one of their connected products will become as essential to everyday life as the smartphone. The recent industry push toward the “smart home” is simply the latest version of this.  For the moment, this strategy is centred on   smart speakers, a first generation of which have now reached the market. These products include the Amazon Echo and Google Home, each of which is supposed to function as the command hub of a connected domestic environment. Amazon’s Echo is a simple cylinder, while the Google Home is a bevelled ovoid. But the physical form of such speakers is all but irrelevant, as their primary job is to function as a branded “virtual assistant” providing a simple, integrated way to access the numerous digital controls scattered throughout the contemporary home  —   from lighting and entertainment to security, heating, cooling and ventilation systems.  Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple each offer their own such assistant, based on   speech recognition. Most are given female names, voices and personalities, presumably based on research indicating that users of all genders prefer to interact with women. Apple’s is called Siri and will, according to reports, soon be getting its own device, Amazon’s Alexa, and Microsoft’s Cortana, while one simply addresses Google’s Home offering as “Google. ” At first, such devices seem harmless enough. They sit patiently and quietly at the periphery of our awareness, and we only speak to them when we need them. But when we consider them more carefully, a more problematic picture emerges. This is how Google’s assistant works: you mention to it that you’re in the mood for Italian food, and then, in the words of one New York Times article, it “will then respond with some suggestions for tables to reserve at Italian restaurants using, for example, the OpenTable app”. This example shows that though the choices these assistants offer us are presented as neutral, they are based on numerous inbuilt assumptions that many of us would question if we were to truly scrutinise them. Ask restaurateurs and    workers what they think of OpenTable, for example, and you will swiftly learn that one person’s convenience is another’s accelerated pace of work, or worse. You’ll learn that restaurants offering reservations via the service are, according to the website Serious Eats, “required to use the company’s proprietary   system, which means leasing hardware and using   software” and that OpenTable retains ownership of all the data generated in this way. You’ll also learn that OpenTable takes a cut on reservations per seated diner, which obviously adds up to a significant amount on a busy night. Conscientious diners have therefore been known to bypass the ostensible convenience of OpenTable, and make whatever reservations they have to by phone. By contrast, Google Home’s frictionless default to making reservations via OpenTable normalises the choice to use that service. This is not accidental. It reflects the largely preconscious valuations, priorities and internalised beliefs of the people who devised Google Home. As throughout the industry, that is a remarkably homogeneous cohort of young designers and engineers. But more important than the degree of similarity they bear to one another is how different they are from everyone else.    devices are generally conceived by people who have completely assimilated services such as Uber, Airbnb and Apple Pay into their daily lives, at a time when figures from the Washington   Pew Research Center suggest that a significant percentage of the population has never used or even heard of them. For the people who design these products, these services are normal, and so, over time, they become normalised for everyone else. There are other challenges presented by this way of interacting with networked information. It’s difficult, for example, for a user to determine whether the options they are being offered by a virtual assistant result from what the industry calls an “organic” return  —   something that legitimately came up as the result of a search process  —   or from paid placement. But the main problem with the virtual assistant is that it fosters an approach to the world that is literally thoughtless, leaving users disinclined to sit out any prolonged frustration of desire, and ever less critical about the processes that result in gratification. Virtual assistants are listening to everything that transpires in their presence, and are doing so at all times. As   interfaces, they must be constantly attentive in order to detect when the “wake word” that rouses them is spoken. In this way, they are able to harvest data that might be used to refine targeted advertising, or for other commercial purposes that are only disclosed deep in the terms and conditions that govern their use. The logic operating here is that of preemptive capture: the notion that companies such as Amazon and Google might as well trawl up everything they can, because no one knows what value might be derived from it in the future. This leads to situations that might be comical, were it not for what they imply about the networking of our domestic environments. These stories circulate as cautionary tales: one of the   was the time the US National Public Radio network aired a story about the Amazon Echo, and various cues spoken on the broadcast were interpreted as commands by Echos belonging to members of the audience, causing domestic chaos. Put aside for one moment the question of disproportionate benefit  —   the idea that you as the user derive a little convenience from your embrace of a virtual assistant, while its provider gets everything  —   all the data about your life and all its value. Let’s simply consider what gets lost in the ideology of convenience that underlies this conception of the internet of things. Are the constraints presented to us by life in the   world really so onerous? Is it really so difficult to wait until you get home before you preheat the oven? And is it worth giving away so much, just to be able to do so remotely? Most of us are by now aware that our mobile phones are constantly harvesting information about our whereabouts and activities. But we tend to be relatively ignorant of the degree to which the contemporary streetscape has also been enabled to collect information. This development is often called the “smart city”. If the ambition beneath the instrumentation of the body is ostensible   and that of the home is convenience, the ambition at the heart of the smart city is nothing other than control  —   the desire to achieve a more efficient use of space, energy and other resources. A broad range of networked   devices are increasingly being deployed in public space, including CCTV cameras advertisements and vending machines equipped with biometric sensors and the indoor micropositioning systems known as “beacons” that, when combined with a smartphone app, send signals providing information about nearby products and services. The picture we are left with is that of our surroundings furiously vacuuming up information, every square metre of seemingly banal pavement yielding so much data about its uses and its users that nobody yet knows what to do with it all. And it is at this scale of activity that the guiding ideology of the internet of things comes into clearest focus. The strongest and most explicit articulation of this ideology in the definition of a smart city has been offered by the house journal of the engineering company Siemens: “Several decades from now, cities will have countless autonomous, intelligently functioning IT systems that will have perfect knowledge of users’ habits and energy consumption, and provide optimum service . .. The goal of such a city is to optimally regulate and control resources by means of autonomous IT systems. ” There is a clear philosophical position, even a worldview, behind all of this: that the world is in principle perfectly knowable, its contents enumerable and their relations capable of being meaningfully encoded in a technical system, without bias or distortion. As applied to the affairs of cities, this is effectively an argument that there is one and only one correct solution to each identified need that this solution can be arrived at algorithmically, via the operations of a technical system furnished with the proper inputs and that this solution is something that can be encoded in public policy, without distortion. (Left unstated, but strongly implicit, is the presumption that whatever policies are arrived at in this way will be applied transparently, dispassionately and in a manner free from politics.) Every aspect of this argument is questionable. Perhaps most obviously, the claim that anything at all is perfectly knowable is perverse. However thoroughly sensors might be deployed in a city, they will only ever capture what is amenable to being captured. In other words, they will not be able to pick up every single piece of information necessary to the formulation of sound civic policy. Other,    distortions inevitably colour the data collected. For instance, people may consciously adapt to produce metrics favourable to them. A police officer under pressure to “make quota” may focus on infractions that she would ordinarily overlook, while conversely, her precinct commander, under pressure to present the city as   may downwardly classify a felony assault as a simple misdemeanour. This is the phenomenon known to viewers of The Wire as “juking the stats,” and it is particularly likely to occur when financial or other incentives depend on achieving a performance threshold. There is also the question of interpretation. Advocates of smart cities often seem to proceed as if it is   that each of our acts has a single, salient meaning, which can be recognised, made sense of and acted upon remotely by an automated system, without any possibility of error. The most prominent advocates of this approach appear to believe that no particular act of interpretation is involved in making use of any data retrieved from the world in this way. But data is never “just” data, and to assert otherwise is to lend inherently political and interested decisions an unmerited gloss of scientific objectivity. The truth is that data is easily skewed, depending on how it is collected. Different values for air pollution in a given location can be produced by varying the height at which a sensor is mounted by a few metres. Perceptions of risk in a neighbourhood can be transformed by slightly altering the taxonomy used to classify reported crimes. And anyone who has ever worked in opinion polling knows how sensitive the results are to the precise wording of a survey. The bold claim of “perfect” knowledge appears incompatible with the messy reality of all known   systems, the human individuals and institutions that make use of them and, more broadly, with the world as we experience it. In fact, it is astonishing that any experienced engineer would ever be so unwary as to claim perfection on behalf of any computational system, no matter how powerful. The notion that there is one and only one solution to urban problems is also deeply puzzling. Cities are made up of individuals and communities who often have competing preferences, and it is impossible to fully satisfy all of them at the same time. That such a solution, if it even existed, could be arrived at algorithmically is also implausible. Assume, for the sake of argument, that there did exist a master formula capable of balancing the needs of all of a city’s competing constituencies. It certainly would be convenient if this golden mean could be determined automatically and consistently. But the wholesale surrender of municipal management to an algorithmic toolset seems to place an undue amount of trust in the party responsible for authoring the algorithm. If the formulas behind this vision of future cities turn out to be anything like the ones used in the current generation of computational models,   decisions will hinge on the interaction of poorly defined and subjective values. The output generated by such a procedure may turn on   abstractions, in which complex circumstances resistant to direct measurement are reduced to more easily determined proxy values: average walking speed stands in for the “pace” of urban life, while the number of patent applications constitutes an index of “innovation” and so on. Quite simply, we need to understand that creating an algorithm intended to guide the distribution of civic resources is itself a political act. And, at least for now, nowhere in the current   literature is there any suggestion that either algorithms or their designers would be subject to the ordinary processes of democratic accountability. And finally, it is difficult to believe that any such findings would ever be translated into public policy in a manner free from politics. Policy recommendations derived from computational models are only rarely applied to questions as politically sensitive as resource allocation without some intermediate tuning taking place. Inconvenient results may be suppressed, arbitrarily overridden by more heavily weighted decision factors, or simply ignored. As matters now stand, the claim of perfect competence that is implicit in most   rhetoric is incommensurate with everything we know about the way technical systems work. It also flies in the face of everything we know about how cities work. The architects of the smart city have failed to reckon with the reality of power, and the ability of elites to suppress policy directions that don’t serve their interests. At best, the technocratic notion that the analysis of   data would ever be permitted to drive municipal policy is naive. At worst, though, it ignores the lessons of history. So, yes: the internet of things presents many new possibilities, and it would be foolish to dismiss those possibilities out of hand. But we would also be wise to approach the entire domain with scepticism, and in particular to resist the attempts of companies to gather ever more data about our lives  —   no matter how much ease, convenience and   we are told they are offering us.

    "Politicians in Stockholm said the policy of “ ” snow removal has failed after the weather brought Sweden’s capital to a standstill last week, with hospitals reporting a fourfold increase in broken bones. [The city switched to a “feminist” system of clearing snow last winter but last week’s burst of snow, which threw the city into chaos, has cast doubt on its effectiveness.  Hundreds of thousands of people were affected, with the majority of bus routes put out of service and commuters having to wait in queues for several hours. Previously, fresh snowfalls were cleared first from main roads and by areas like construction sites before being removed from pavements and cycle lanes. As men are more likely to drive and women more likely to travel on foot, more women slipped on the ice which led to complaints that the system was sexist.   of Stockholm, the Green Party’s Daniel Helldén, admitted that “equality snow removal” had failed the city, and apologised to residents who had injured themselves as a result. When the   coalition, comprising politicians from the Social Democratic Party, Green Party, Left Party, and Feminist Initiative, were elected to City Hall in 2014 the introduction of a “feminist” snow clearance was high on the agenda. But police last week said the system is so bad, with ambulances unable to make their way along Stockholm’s roads, it posed a danger to society. Officer Fredrik Ståhle branded the conditions for drivers in the city “deplorable”. Opposition   Cecilia Brinck called the concept of “ ” snow removal “a little silly”. The Moderate party politician said despite the promise that feminist   would make life better for women, its implementation made the weather “bad for everyone”. Per Ossmer and Martin Westmont from the Sweden Democrats said that the city’s snow clearance plan should not be “characterised by a feminist perspective”. Speaking for the populist party in a piece for Stockholm Direkt, the pair advised that politicians prioritise delivering an effective transport system over investing “considerable resources” in “gender certifying” various services.": "41234",
    "LaVar Ball’s confounding parenting tactics go beyond the   dynamics he’s made his life. He also advises his sons on how to treat  —   or, if they want, mistreat  —   their mother. The brash basketball father, who shared a rare moment of vulnerability in May when he   dove a little deeper into the role of the one member of the Ball family who’s stayed out of the spotlight. Following Ball’s twisted logic, the three sons apparently learned to refrain from misogynistic insults against their mom only so they could get what they needed from her. “I told them, ‘If you’re going to be disrespectful to your mom, I want you to be all the time.’ So, excuse my language right here, but if you want to say, ‘Good morning, b —  ’ that’s fine with me,” Ball   at the family’s home in Chino Hills, Calif.. “I’m not going to say nothing. If you want to call your mom a b —    that’s fine. But don’t get sick, when your stomach is hurting and you want me to care for you because you know I ain’t.   …     She’ll clean up the   the s —  t, whatever. She’ll take care of what you want.   …     So don’t wait until you need something, or you need her to make you something, and now you want to be nice to her.   …     “So they never disrespect their mom or talk back to her or say nothing. Because I say, ‘In the long run, you’re going to need her before you need me. ’” When it came to the boys breaking   rules, LaVar said he had no problem using physical punishment  —   “a couple of hits upside the head” to   Lonzo after he missed curfew and had a   with police or using a “belt or something” on youngest son LaMelo  —   before quickly backtracking. “I spanked them once,” Ball said as clarification, “to let them know there are repercussions at times. But my boys are respectful, and usually my voice is enough. ” Ball’s voice has been ringing in the ears of the basketball world since son Lonzo emerged as a star guard at UCLA and an expected   pick in the NBA draft on June 22. Tina, meanwhile, has been trying to regain her speech after she suffered a stroke in February that hospitalized her for about three months and damaged her verbal abilities. Ball said he’s been monitoring Tina since she returned home and feels confident he can restore her strength while their sons continue doing what they were raised to do: play basketball. “Like I told my boys: ‘I got her. Now you can do whatever you want to do. What I’m not going to is burden you with sitting there rubbing her hand.   …     We’re not making a movie,’” he said. “That’s my wife, and I take care of her. She wants to talk, and she can get out a few words. I’m rebooting her now right now. She’s saying, ‘LaVar, you’re right. You are right.’ That’s all I want to hear her say. Now we can get another 25 years having a good time. She is going to get better with me. ” Although Tina won’t be feeling well enough in time to attend the draft, Ball said, there’s no doubt in his mind Lonzo will wind up a Laker. And that assumption is only the first part of the equation. Next up in Ball’s wildly optimistic mind:    LiAngelo and    LaMelo will go “  ” and find their way to Los Angeles at any cost. “I’m going to do the same thing with Melo,” Ball said. “And we get three of the Ball boys on the Lakers together, and we gonna go championship, championship, championship, championship, championship. You think I’m playing? You saw what they did in high school. ”": "132724",
    "Donald Trump’s campaign CEO, Stephen Bannon, said during a 2011 radio interview that progressives vilify prominent women in the conservative movement because they are not “a bunch of dykes that came from the Seven Sisters schools. ” Citing women like Ann Coulter, Michele Bachmann, and Sarah Palin, Bannon said conservative women threaten the progressive narrative. “And so these women cut to the heart of the progressive narrative,” he said on Political Vindication Radio while promoting his movie, Fire From the Heartland: the Awakening of the Conservative Woman. “That’s why there are some unintended consequences of the women’s liberation movement. That, in fact, the women that would lead this country would be   they would have husbands, they would love their children. They wouldn’t be a bunch of dykes that came from the Seven Sisters schools up in New England. That drives the left insane and that’s why they hate these women,” he said. The Seven Sisters schools are the historic women’s colleges of Barnard College, Bryn Mawr College, Mount Holyoke College, Radcliffe College, Smith College, Vassar College, and Wellesley College in the Northeast. Bannon’s past has come under scrutiny in recent days, with old court filings showing he faced accusations from his   of   and domestic violence. Bannon said earlier in the 2011 interview that the progressive narrative was all about victimhood. “The progressive narrative Saturday morning was the progressive narrative and that is all about victimhood,” he said. “They’re either a victim of race. They’re victim of their sexual preference. They’re a victim of gender. All about victimhood and the United States is the great oppressor, not the great liberator. ”": "110154",
    "The Clinton Global Initiative, which arranges donations to help solve the world’s problems, set up a financial commitment that benefited a   company   by people with ties to the Clintons, including a current and a former Democratic official and a close friend of former President Bill Clinton. The $2 million commitment was placed on the agenda for a September 2010 conference of the Clinton Global Initiative at Mr. Clinton’s urging, according to a document from the period and people familiar with the matter. Mr. Clinton also personally endorsed the company, Energy Pioneer Solutions Inc. to   Secretary Steven Chu for a federal grant that year, said people with knowledge of the endorsement.

Mr. Chu, now a professor at Stanford University, said he didn’t remember the conversation. The Clinton Global Initiative is a program of the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. The foundation has been a focus of criticism this political season over donations received from governments and corporations that had business before Mrs. Clinton when she was secretary of state and that could be affected by decisions she would make as president.

    "Good news: We’ve got a Code Switch podcast extra for you this week  —   Karen Grigsby Bates sat down with NPR’s movie critic, Bob Mondello, to talk about Southside with You, a new independent film about Michelle and Barack Obama’s very first date, back in the summer of 1989. The film takes place over the course of a single afternoon, and, as the title suggests, is set on the South Side of Chicago. Famous subjects notwithstanding, Southside with You is your typical date movie, complete with   antics (Barack shows up late Michelle refuses to admit she’s on an actual date.) But, as Karen and Bob point out, there’s something amazing in the film’s simplicity  —   and that’s because it’s pretty uncommon to see everyday black romance on the screen today. The film is ”not about other things, it’s just about the two of them getting to know each other,” Bob says. ”What’s remarkable about the film is that at any given moment, it’s not being remarkable. It’s being lifelike. And that is such a rarity in movies. You don’t see   characters behaving in a way that is just, sort of, normal.” Bob says the film industry has a bit of a checkered history when it comes to    love. Some of the earliest examples he’s found were musicals  —   full, operatic productions, like Cabin in the Sky, Porgy and Bess, and Carmen Jones. He and Karen theorize that stylizing black love with music was a way of making it safe for white audiences  —   because, as Karen ponders, ”Who has sex in a musical?” (OK, we know, we’ve seen Spring Awakening, too.) In 1961, that began to change with the film adaptation of Lorraine Hansberry’s A Raisin in the Sun. The film starred Sidney Poitier and Ruby Dee, and was, in many ways, a showcase of normal black love. Over the years, Poitier became the paragon for a black male romantic lead in the movies. Later on, it seemed that Denzel Washington might fill that space, with roles like Demetrius Williams in Mississippi Masala in 1991. But unlike Poitier, Washington didn’t keep playing the perfect guy in movies  —   Training Day and American Gangster were hardly  . The realm of black love on screen continued to grow into the ’90s, with hits like Waiting to Exhale in 1995, Love Jones in ’97, How Stella Got Her Groove Back in ’98, and Love  Basketball in 2000. But in 2016, it’s once again become rare to see two black characters fall in love on screen. The simple presence of that love story is what makes Southside with You special  —   even more than the fact that we’re watching   fan fiction of a sitting president and First Lady.

    "Boston Globe and Bloomberg News journalist Joshua Green had some breaking news to share on Thursday’s Breitbart News Daily about the stark difference in negative campaign ads endured by Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in their respective primaries. [To get a sense of how the Republican and Democratic primaries differed, Bloomberg News consulted with a media tracking firm and asked, “How many dollars of negative ads were run versus Donald Trump in the Republican primary, and how many were run against Hillary Clinton?”  “The disparity could not have been more striking,” he said. “  million dollars in ads run against Trump, zero in attack ads run against Clinton. ” Green noted such an imbalance in negative advertising was unprecedented. “Back in 2008, the last time the Democrats had an open primary, you had Hillary Clinton hitting Barack Obama with the famous ‘3 a. m.’ ad, and there was a lot of kind of  ” he recalled. “This time, nothing. No attacks. So essentially, Clinton got through the Democratic primaries unscathed. ” Green thought this was not necessarily good news for the Democrats.  “I think there are two schools of thought on this,” he said, adding: If you talk to Republican strategists, they will say, “Look, Hillary Clinton has had zero dollars in negative ads run against her, and her favorability numbers are only marginally better than Trump’s. Once we start running ads, they’re gonna fall even further, and she’s in real trouble. ” “The Democratic sort of    —   and I do put some stock in this  —   is that, look, it’s better to come out of a primary with your reputation, your political reputation intact,” he continued. “Look what happened to Mitt Romney in 2012, when Newt and Rick Perry branded him a ‘vulture capitalist. ’” SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon noted that Clinton’s Democratic rival Sen. Bernie Sanders went decidedly more negative against her in the final days of his campaign, while 72 percent of his supporters say they do not trust her, leading him to conclude that her political reputation is not intact. He noted Green’s revelation that the lack of primary attack ads against Clinton was as stunning as the complete absence of media questioning she faced for the Clinton Cash revelations. Bannon said that Clinton and her surrogates do not seem   to deal with the trustworthiness issues she was never hit with during the primary, based on some embarrassing stumbles they have made lately.  Green countered by citing Bill Clinton’s   in 1996, and noting, “You don’t necessarily need to be considered trustworthy to get elected president. ” “The problem she has, I would say, is sort of the flip side of the Trump problem,” he suggested. He continued: Trump got through the Republican nomination because Republicans didn’t want to make a lot of the attacks that Hillary is going to make. The flip side for this is the fact that Bernie didn’t attack Hillary on her secret Goldman Sachs speeches, and on this Clinton Foundation stuff, and on the emails, means that we still have five months to go where there is gonna be a candidate who’s gonna raise those issues. Green predicted that if Trump can “show the discipline and the wherewithal to not go berserk attacking, you know, judges with Mexican heritage, and if he can train his fire on the Clinton message that the party wants him to talk about  —   on the Clinton Cash message, basically  —   then I think he could potentially do a lot of damage to her, and you could see those negatives rise even higher. ” “It only takes one thing from Trump, and that is ” he stressed. “It’s the one thing he hasn’t exhibited a lot of. ” “Look, the minute you open your mouth, if you’re Donald Trump, and you talk about Trump University, or a Mexican judge, or something like that, the media are gonna flock like moths to a flame and cover that, and they’re not going to cover Hillary Clinton,” he warned. “This is the big complaint that Republicans justifiably had when the IG report came out on Hillary’s email. Did anybody pay attention to that?” he asked, then answered himself: “Not really because they were so busy talking to Trump about the judge and listening to Trump double down, and triple down, and quadruple down on these attacks. ” Green said he personally found the IG report against Clinton stunning, but the “Trump Effect” causes him to “dominate news coverage,” for better and worse. “We’ve been seeing that since basically last summer,” he observed. “The downside of that is, the media only covers what comes out of Trump’s mouth. And if he’s not talking about the IG report, if he’s not talking about Hillary Clinton’s email, then that’s not going to get the type of    coverage that you want to see happen, if you’re a Republican. ” Bannon envisioned the 2016 election as “the heavyweight title match, in living memory, of two candidates who are both heavyweights and not afraid to go to places other people that maybe have more decorum won’t go. ” “Oh, absolutely, absolutely,” laughed Green. “That’s what’s so fascinating about the race, and that’s the thing that really does scare a lot of Clinton strategists about Trump,” he said. “Any traditional Republican candidate, you basically know the parameters of the possible attacks. With Trump, it could be literally anything, and that’s hard to prepare for. ”  “It’s also hard to drive your own message, if you’re Clinton and the Democrats, because at any moment, Trump could open his mouth and say something that is going to completely wipe out whatever it is that you think you want to talk about,” he added.

According to McCaul, Rahami stated in the journal “his guidance” came from Abu Muhammad   the chief spokesperson and propagandist for the terror group ISIS, who was killed in a US drone strike in Syria in August. “Death to the oppression,” Rahami wrote. “God willing the sound of bombs will be heard in the streets. ”  —  Jon Passantino, Bharara went on to list that evidence, which included12 fingerprints on the “undetonated bomb” on 27th Street in Chelsea, surveillance video of Rahami near the detonated 23rd Street bomb   before the explosion and video of Rahami walking with a suitcase at 27th Street, and license plate readers that showed his vehicle, which was linked to his home address, entering Manhattan through the Lincoln Tunnel two hours before the explosion and leaving Manhattan two hours after.  Bharara also said during the press conference Wednesday that a “handwritten journal was found on Rahami at the time of his arrest” which mentioned, jihad, pipe bombs, a pressure cooker bomb and the sounds of bombs heard in the street. The journal, according to Bharara, also contained “laudatory” references to   founder Osama bin Laden and Anwar   an American citizen whose speeches have been credited with inspiring domestic terrorists even years after his death by a US drone strike in Yemen.  “This weekend, as you all appreciate, the American way of life was attacked and everyday routines were shaken by explosions in Chelsea and Seaside Park,” Bharara opened the press conference by saying.  “The response to these misguided acts of terror has been classically American, and what we have come to expect in our city from New Yorkers: care for the victims, calm in the midst of chaos, and swift law enforcement action. Now, thanks to that response, Rahami will face federal terrorism charges in a court of law. ”   —  Talal Ansari, Surveillance footage obtained by the FBI shows the two men “located a piece of luggage on the sidewalk, removed an improvised explosive device from the luggage, and then left the vicinity leaving the device behind but taking the luggage,” the FBI said in a statement. The video was taken on 27th Street between 6th and 7th Avenues in Manhattan, and was taken within the same hour a bomb exploded four blocks south, on 23rd Street, injuring 29 people. “The FBI is interested in speaking to these individuals and recovering the luggage,” the agency said.  A widely circulated photo of the improvised explosive device revealed it was a pressure cooker bomb with exposed wires.   —   Talal Ansari, FBI seeks public’s help in locating two men related to   investigation https:  .  The complaint against Rahami, filed in the Southern District of New York, includes four charges: Use of weapons of mass destruction, bombing a place of public use, destruction of property by means of fire or explosive, and use of a destructive device during and in furtherance of a crime of violence. Prosecutors also charged Rahami in New Jersey Tuesday with six counts related to using weapons of mass destruction and bombs. Several of Rahami’s charges in both states carry potential life sentences.  The complaints also provide details about how Rahami allegedly bought, built, and tried to detonate the bombs. At the site of an explosion at Seaside Park in New Jersey, for example, investigators found an explosive device made of three pipe bombs. They also found a cell phone in the area that they believe was used as a timer for the bomb.  At the scene of the explosion in New York City’s Chelsea neighborhood, investigators found ball bearings and steel nuts they believe were packed into a pressure cooker bomb to make it more deadly scattered over the blast site that spanned 650 square feet. The complaint mentions two victims who were inside cars but nevertheless injured when the bomb went off. As was the case with the New Jersey explosion, investigators believe Rahami used a cellphone as a timer for the Chelsea bomb. Prosecutors believe Rahami bought bomb components, including chemicals and devices he could use as detonators, on Ebay. The complaint describes purchases going back to June 20 and continuing through August. The complaint also states that investigators searched social media accounts believed to belong to Rahami and found that he had liked videos related to jihad.  In addition, authorities recovered what they describe as Rahami’s handwritten journal. In it, Rahami allegedly praises   leader Anwar   and Fort Hood shooter Nidal Hasan. According to the complaint, his journal concludes: “Inshallah [God willing] the sounds of the bombs will be heard in the streets. Gun shots to your police. Death To Your OPPRESSION. ”  —   Jim Dalrymple II, It remains unclear what law enforcement agency has taken the lead on interrogating Rahami. The FBI did not respond to questions asking whether federal interrogators had yet gained access to the suspect.  —   Ali Watkins, “In August 2014, the FBI initiated an assessment of Ahmad Rahami based upon comments made by his father after a domestic dispute that were subsequently reported to authorities,” the FBI said in a statement sent to BuzzFeed News.  “The FBI conducted internal database reviews, interagency checks, and multiple interviews, none of which revealed ties to terrorism. ” His father, Mohammad Rahami, told the New York Times earlier on Tuesday he called authorities because his son was “doing really bad. ” “Two years ago I go to the FBI because my son was doing really bad, OK?” Mohammad Rahami said. “But they check almost two months, they say, ‘He’s OK, he’s clean, he’s not a terrorist.’ I say OK. ”  —  David Mack, On Tuesday, while speaking with reporters outside the family’s restaurant in Elizabeth, N. J. Mohammad Rahami said, “I called the FBI two years ago,” the New York Times reported. “Two years ago I go to the FBI because my son was doing really bad, OK?” Mohammad Rahami said. “But they check almost two months, they say, ‘He’s OK, he’s clean, he’s not a terrorist.’ I say OK. ” “Now they say he is a terrorist,” Rahami said. “I say OK. ” The Associated Press reported that Mohammad Rahami contacted the FBI in 2014 and told them that he believed his son was a terrorist, but later retracted the statement, according to an official. ABC News reported that in the summer of 2014 a “concerned citizen” also called police in New Jersey to report that Mohammad Rahami had said that his son may be in contact with individuals overseas who were collecting explosives. Based on this report, a “Suspicious Activity Report” was compiled on Rahami and sent to the FBI. Federal agents then interviewed Mohammad Rahami, who told the FBI that his son had traveled to Pakistan and was interacting with “bad people,” ABC News reported. The handwritten notes also referenced the 2009 Fort Hood shooting that left 13 people dead and 30 others injured, and was described to NBC News as “a hodge podge, a rambling, disconnected, choppy series of references to past events. ”    who was killed in a US drone strike in 2011 in Yemen, was a spokesman for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and editor of the terrorist group’s online magazine Inspire. In one section of Rahami’s notes, which were covered in blood and pierced by a bullet hole, the    wrote of “killing the kuffar,” or unbeliever, the New York Times reported. NBC originally said the note was found on an unexploded pressure cooker bomb left Saturday night on 27th Street in Manhattan, four blocks from where another exploded, but CNN and the Washington Post said the note was found on Rahami after his arrest Monday in Linden, New Jersey.  —  Jon Passantino, The official said authorities were working with officials in Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates to find her and question her about what she knew of her husband’s actions.  On Monday, a New Jersey lawmaker said Rahami had contacted his office when he was in Pakistan in 2014 to ask for help in securing a visa for his pregnant wife. Rep. Albio Sires said Rahami emailed his office in 2014 after his wife’s Pakistani passport expired, the Associated Press reported. Sires said he contacted the FBI about Rahami’s request, and the follow up letter his office sent to the US embassy in Pakistan, after he was named as a suspect. Bar owner who spotted Bombings suspect speaks out: It ”shocked me” https:  .  https:  .  Bains said it was raining when he saw that he thought was just a drunk man sleeping outside his bar with a hoodie pulled around his face. Around 9 a. m. Rahami was leaning against the door of the bar, which had a cracked piece of glass, so Bains suggested that he move. “I said, ‘Hey buddy, you’re going to get hurt, this door is cracked,’” Bains recalled. Rahami moved, but as he did Bains got a glimpse of his face and “was shocked” when he recognized the same person he had seen earlier on CNN’s website. Later, Bains told a friend about the man who resembled the bombing suspect.  The friend suggested contacting law enforcement, so Bains called the Linden Police Department.  A shootout ensued later Monday morning when Lindon police arrived at the scene. Bains said he saw two officers arrive, then watched as Rahami fired two shots at them. Rahami then ran, “firing in the air,” Bains said.  “The whole thing took maybe 30 seconds or less than 30 seconds,” Bains said.  Rahami and two officers were wounded in the shootout, but no one was killed. Rahami remains in custody after being hospitalized for his injuries.  Bains was praised in the aftermath for recognizing the man and alerting authorities, but told CNN instead that he simply believes “when you see something you should say something. ” “I’m not a hero,” Bains added. “I’m just a citizen doing what every citizen should do. ” Rep. Albio Sires said Rahami, a US citizen who was born in Afghanistan, emailed his office in 2014 after his wife’s Pakistani passport expired, the Associated Press reported. Rahami, who remains in custody after alleging planting bombs in New York and New Jersey and getting in a shootout with police, was charged with attempted murder and other weapons related crimes on Monday. Sires said he contacted the FBI about Rahami’s request, and the follow up letter his office sent to the US embassy in Pakistan, after he was named as a suspect. It was unclear if Rahami wife ever came to the US.  —  Jason Wells, Union County Prosecutor Grace H. Park announced the charges over the shootout that occurred on Monday morning prior to Rahami’s capture by police. Rahami is also facing two   charges over his alleged possession of a handgun. “At approximately 10:30 a. m. on Monday morning, a uniformed Linden police officer approached a man later identified as Rahami outside a bar on East Elizabeth Avenue, according to the investigation,” the prosecutor’s office said in a statement. “At that time, Rahami immediately produced a handgun and shot the officer in the torso, striking him in his protective vest. ” “Additional patrol officers responding to the scene engaged Rahami in an exchange of gunfire that ended when Rahami was shot multiple times outside of an auto repair shop on East Elizabeth Avenue, several blocks west of where he was initially approached,” the prosecutor’s office said. Bail for Rahami was set at $5. 2 million by state Superior Court Judge Regina Caulfield. Each attempted murder charge carries potential prison term of 10 to 20 years, while Rahami could also face jail terms of   years for each weapons charges.  —  David Mack, The    woman told Fox Rahami did not pay child support and was angry at Western culture. “He would speak often of Western culture and how it was different back home,” she said. “How there weren’t homosexuals in Afghanistan. “He seemed standoffish to American culture, but I never thought he would cross the line. “One time, he was watching TV with my daughter and a woman in a [military] uniform came on and he told [their daughter] ‘That’s the bad person,’” she said. Here’s everything we know so far about Rahami.  —  David Mack, “Remember that we’re less than 48 hours into a multitude of five attacks,” Burr told BuzzFeed News. “And in less than 48 hours we have somebody in custody. But 48 hours is not enough to take the media or the weapons and do the forensics on them we need to do to make that determination. ” He added that authorities also do not yet know if there was more than one person involved in the attacks, in the US or abroad.  “We won’t know until we’ve worked with the media we’ve got,” he said.  —   Emma Loop,": "110957",
    "President Donald Trump’s nominee to become director of national intelligence assured senators on Tuesday that he’d be an apolitical and independent spymaster with full control over the U. S. intelligence agencies. Former Sen. Dan Coats tried to placate the worries of his onetime colleagues on the Senate Intelligence Committee who said they were worried by the appearance of Trump’s early attempts to sideline the job before Coats was confirmed. ”I’m reassured with regard to your position,” said Sen. Martin Heinrich,  . M. ”I am not reassured with regard to the process these [orders] have been going through.” Trump raised eyebrows in the national security world by ordering changes to the National Security Council, inside the White House staff. He added his chief political strategist, Steve Bannon, to what had in past been considered a   committee. And he made other changes viewed as hostile to the DNI and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the nation’s top uniformed military officer. Not long after, news organizations reported that Trump was considering bringing in a friend, financier Stephen Feinberg, to do a ”review” of the intelligence community. Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins condemned the notion of someone coming in from the outside to take an oversight role beyond that of the DNI and the president’s existing National Intelligence Council. ”This is a textbook definition of waste and duplication,” she said. The White House has since said it would revise its goals for the National Security Council and Trump has cast doubt on whether he’d actually order the review to be undertaken by Feinberg. Coats told the committee on Tuesday that the administration has assured him he’ll have the full authority and independence of his predecessors. ”I have full confidence that’s the way it’ll turn out,” Coats said. Trump’s relationship with the intelligence services has been rocky since before his inauguration. He blasted what he called leaks of classified information that have appeared in news reports linking his presidential campaign with Russia’s intelligence services. And he has also gone back and forth about whether he accepts the conclusion of the U. S. intelligence community that Russia meddled in last year’s presidential election. Coats told senators Russia ”definitely” tried to influence the presidential race, but echoed the spy agencies’ careful agnosticism by adding, ”to what extent they were successful, I don’t think we know.” Coats also said Russia continues to run the same playbook in political races taking place today in Europe, including France and Germany, and he suggested there need to be ”consequences.” Trump’s predecessor President Barack Obama ejected some Russian diplomats from the U. S. and imposed some sanctions in retaliation for the Russian meddling, but Coats’ remarks suggested he supports even more action. ”Russia’s assertiveness in global affairs is something I view with grave concern,” he said. As a former senator and former member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Coats got a genial reception and his confirmation appears likely. But Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Lankford and Maine’s independent Sen. Angus King both warned Coats that once he is in his new job, he can’t always be the nice guy from Indiana. ”I’m not sure likability and affability are the qualities I want in this position,” King said. ”I want somebody who’s crusty and tough and mean.”": "162431",
    "Budweiser has chosen the charged political issue of immigration as the subject of its Super Bowl LI commercial. [The   spot explains the origin story of the beer company’s immigrant   Adolphus Busch.  The ad, titled “Born the Hard Way,” begins with a young,   Busch being told, “You’re not wanted here! Go back home!” The big budget production eventually sees Busch land on the shores of St. Louis where he built his  . “This is the story of the original   man, one of the founders of the American Dream, making it the hard way, and his path that all came after him followed,” Laura Rowan, of Budweiser’s creative branch told Adweek. “We then see the words appear: ‘When nothing will stop your dream, this is the beer you’ll drink.’ We end with the Budweiser logo and [tagline] ‘This Bud’s for you,’” she said of the ad. Ricardo Marques, vice president and executive for the Budweiser brand in the U. S. says the company’s   Super Bowl ad is “relevant today,” in light of President Donald Trump’s executive order temporarily suspending the U. S. Refugee Admissions Program and his executive order intended to tighten security along the U. S.  border and enhance enforcement of U. S. immigration laws. “It’s true, Adolphus Busch made an incredible journey to this country, and that’s really what this is about. It’s about his vision, his dream, everything that he doest to achieve that,” Marques told AdWeek. “Even though it happened in the 1850s, it’s a story that is super relevant today. That’s what we’re honing in on it’s the pursuit, the effort, the passion, the drive, the hard work, the ambition, that’s really what this is about more than anything else. ” However, Marques insists that the ad’s placement during the Super Bowl is not an attempt at making a political statement. “There’s really no correlation with anything else that’s happening in the country,” he said. “We believe this is a universal story that is very relevant today because probably more than any other period in history today the world pulls you in different directions, and it’s never been harder to stick to your guns. ” Despite Marques’s assurance that the Super Bowl ad is not about making a political statement, his company has recently played politics with its commercials. Bud Light, another brand under the   InBev umbrella, hired and then fired   actors Amy Schumer and Seth Rogen, who starred in the beer brand’s “Bud Light Party” television  last year. One of the   ads enraged viewers, who slammed the Bud Light gender pay   commercial. What’s more,   InBev, which recently cut its revenue projections for the year after reporting a consistent sales slump, invested   levels on its short TV spot. Budweiser ads typically cost between $2 million to $3 million to produce. Add the record $5 million average cost for a   Super Bowl ad, and it’s easy to understand why the brewing company is hoping its $12 to $15 million commercial can spur growth in sales.

    "ROME  —   Italy’s foreign minister, Paolo Gentiloni, accepted a presidential mandate on Sunday to try to form a new government, hoping to lead Italy out of a political crisis that ensued with the resignation of Matteo Renzi as prime minister. Mr. Renzi stepped down last week after the defeat of a referendum on constitutional changes that he had hoped would streamline Italy’s government. He staked his seat on the outcome, and failed. In a brief speech on Sunday, Mr. Gentiloni, 62, said he had accepted the challenge of forming a new government out of a “sense of responsibility. ” “I’m aware of the urgency to give Italy a government in the fullness of its powers, to reassure the citizens and to face with utmost commitment and determination international, economic and social priorities, starting with the reconstruction of the   areas,” Mr. Gentiloni said. In coming days, Mr. Gentiloni is expected to form a government using the same majority, led by the   Democratic Party, as his predecessor, and to then face a confidence vote before Parliament, perhaps as early as Tuesday. His cabinet is likely to resemble that of Mr. Renzi, with whom he has had a close relationship. For those reasons, the opposition,   Five Star Movement has already called Mr. Gentiloni “Renzi’s avatar. ” Mr. Gentiloni, a journalist, has long worked in   parties. A communications minister in Romano Prodi’s government until 2008, he has been in charge of Italy’s foreign affairs for two years. He has advocated international support to stop violence in Libya and help for migrants who gather on those shores before risking their lives crossing the Mediterranean. This year, he lobbied with the Egyptian government to find out who was responsible for the death of a young Italian researcher in Cairo. In his brief speech on Sunday, Mr. Gentiloni said he would work to clarify Italy’s new electoral rules “with the necessary promptness. ” Disputes over the laws are a central obstacle to the country’s holding a new election. In late January, Italy’s Constitutional Court is scheduled to issue a   verdict on the current system, which may face an overhaul. Most of the opposition parties are calling for elections soon after, a year ahead of the due date in spring 2018. But Italy’s president, Sergio Mattarella, noted at the end of his consultations with Italy’s political leaders that the Democratic Party still held a parliamentary majority. The decision whether and when to call elections, then, will rest in the hands of Mr. Mattarella. Mr. Renzi has all but vanished from Italy’s political scene. Soon after moving boxes of “books, clothes and notes” out of Palazzo Chigi, the prime minister’s residence, Mr. Renzi repeated that he had kept his promise to step aside if he lost the referendum, writing in a long Facebook post from his hometown in Tuscany. He also pledged to try again to reunite the country. “Only those who change can help a country as beautiful and difficult as Italy,” he said, acknowledging his mistakes.": "25622",

    "New England winters are melting away.  out of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the northeastern United States will see warmer temperatures significantly faster than the rest of the planet. “I tell my students that they’re going to be able to tell their children, ‘I remember when it used to snow in Boston,’” Raymond Bradley,   of the study, and director of the Climate System Research Center at UMass,  . The study, published Jan. 11 in PLOS ONE, suggests that the Northeast will reach the Paris Agreement’s global warming threshold 20 years earlier than anywhere else in the world. The Paris pact sought to limit the rise in global temperatures to two degrees Celsius (3. 6 degrees Fahrenheit.) Average global temperature have already risen one degree since 1880, and   of that increase has taken place since 1975. The 2 degree mark is considered the point of no return for catastrophic effects of global warming. “The 2 C number is a global average, and many regions will warm more, and warm more rapidly, than the earth as a whole,”  Bradley and his   Dr. Ambarish Karmalkar, predict the Northeast will have already warmed by 3 degrees Celsius as the rest of the world approaches the 2 degrees mark. Their report follows an   which found that, in a   scenario, rising sea levels could sink 30 percent of Boston by the end of the century. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Jan. 9 that   behind 2012. “No other year had as many states breaking or close to breaking their warmest annual average temperature,” NOAA said in a statement, calling the warming “unparalleled. ” The Northeast can expect more wet winters, an increase in flooding, and many, many more   days (at least 90 a year, compared to 11.) The southwest is also expected to warm faster, while the Northwest and Great Plains will experience longer droughts and drier summers. “Policymakers need information that is useful at the local, not global scale,” Karmalkar said in the press release. But despite the agreement’s global attempt to curb temperature increase,   found that even if countries meet their pledges, a failure to cut an additional 12 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 would result in a warming between 2. 9 to 3. 4 degrees Celsius (5. 2 to 6. 1 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of this century. And the World Economic Forum’s annual risk report   predicted that the world is now most likely to be devastated by environmental  —   not economic  —   disasters.

He said that peace required a   Palestinian state, with a full end to Israeli military occupation, and normalization of Israel’s relations with its neighbors.

    "WASHINGTON  —   The escalating American military engagement in Somalia has led the Obama administration to expand the legal scope of the war against Al Qaeda, a move that will strengthen   Donald J. Trump’s authority to combat thousands of Islamist fighters in the chaotic Horn of Africa nation. The administration has decided to deem the Shabab, the Islamist militant group in Somalia, to be part of the armed conflict that Congress authorized against the perpetrators of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, according to senior American officials. The move is intended to shore up the legal basis for an intensifying campaign of airstrikes and other counterterrorism operations, carried out largely in support of African Union and Somali government forces. The executive branch’s stretching of the 2001 war authorization against the original Al Qaeda to cover other Islamist groups in countries far from Afghanistan  —   even ones, like the Shabab, that did not exist at the time  —   has prompted recurring objections from some legal and foreign policy experts. The Shabab decision is expected to be publicly disclosed next month in a letter to Congress listing global deployments. It is part of the Obama administration’s pattern of relaxing various   rules for airstrikes against Islamist militants as it tries to help its partner forces in several conflicts. In June, the administration quietly broadened the military’s authority to carry out airstrikes in Afghanistan to encompass operations intended “to achieve strategic effects,” meaning targeting people impeding the work of Afghan government forces, officials said. Previously, strikes in Afghanistan were permitted only in   for counterterrorism operations targeting Qaeda or Islamic State forces, or to “prevent a strategic defeat” of Afghan forces. Later in the summer, the administration deemed Surt, Libya, an “area of active hostilities,” after the Libyan prime minister asked for assistance in dislodging Islamic State militants from that city. The move exempted the area from 2013 rules that restrict drone strikes and other counterterrorism operations away from battlefield zones, which President Obama had announced in a major speech that year that sought to turn a page in the   war against Al Qaeda. As of last week, the Pentagon had carried out 420 airstrikes against militants in Surt since August. In Somalia, the 2013 rules limiting airstrikes away from “areas of active hostilities” still apply for now. But in practice, restrictions are being eased there in another way: Over the past year, the military has routinely invoked a   exception to those rules for airstrikes taken in “” which can include strikes to help foreign partners even when Americans are not at direct risk. The Shabab grew up as an Islamist insurgency after 2007, when Ethiopia, with American support, invaded Somalia to overthrow an Islamist council that had briefly taken control of much of the   country. The officials familiar with the internal deliberations spoke on the condition of anonymity. In a statement, Lisa Monaco, Mr. Obama’s top counterterrorism adviser, emphasized that the terrorist threat “is constantly evolving and requires an adaptable response. ” The administration’s strategy, Ms. Monaco said, “recognizes that we must more effectively partner with countries where terrorist networks take hold, enabling and empowering these partners to share the burden of combating these threats to our mutual interests. ” “Because the threats and enemies we face evolve and adapt,” she continued, “we must be flexible in confronting them where they are  —   always doing so consistent with our laws and our values. ” But some experts criticized the administration for using a    congressional authorization as a justification to go to war with the Shabab. “It’s crazy that a piece of legislation that was grounded specifically in the experience of   is now being repurposed for close air support for regional security forces in Somalia,” said Micah Zenko, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Under the 2001 authorization, the United States is engaged in an armed conflict with a specific organization, not every Islamist militant in the world. But that authority has proved elastic. In 2014, for example, Mr. Obama declared that the 2001 law authorized him to battle the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. An Army captain rejected that claim and argued that the Islamic State war was illegal because Congress had never explicitly approved it. Last week, a judge dismissed that lawsuit, without ruling on its merits. In Somalia, the United States had long taken the position that a handful of Shabab leaders, as individuals, had sufficient ties to Al Qaeda to make them wartime targets. But it has debated internally for years whether the Shabab as a whole, including their thousands of foot soldiers, can or should be declared part of the enemy. To qualify as an “associated force,” a group must be an organized armed body that has aligned with Al Qaeda and entered the fight against the United States or its partners. Officials declined to discuss whether there were specific new reasons to justify declaring that the Shabab could meet that standard. For now, the administration intends to continue its strategy in Somalia of primarily helping partner forces battle the Shabab  —   including carrying out airstrikes to defend them when they get into trouble during missions. It is not declaring Somalia an “area of active hostilities,” which would free up the American military to carry out airstrikes targeting   militants more expansively. In particular, officials said, Somalia  —   unlike Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Surt  —   will continue to be subject to the Presidential Policy Guidance, the set of 2013 rules for drone strikes and other counterterrorism operations outside conventional war zones. The 2013 rules apply restraints on the use of lethal force outside areas of active hostilities. They include   interagency review of proposed strikes and requirements that the target pose a threat to Americans  —   not just to American interests  —   and near certainty that no civilians would be killed. But the military always retains an inherent right to carry out strikes in its own defense, officials said, and it has conducted “collective  ” strikes to aid partners in Somalia with growing frequency over the past year. On March 5, the military carried out a huge airstrike in Somalia that killed over 150 people said to be Shabab fighters planning to attack an African Union base where American advisers were stationed. The military undertook the strike without consulting Washington policy makers, calling it a matter of  . The enormous death toll raised internal questions, officials said, about whether the   exception in the 2013 rules had become a loophole permitting more unconstrained warfare. The dilemma sharpened in the following months as   Somali government forces got into trouble and required “collective  ” airstrikes to bail them out, even though no American advisers faced direct threat. The emerging pattern, officials said, brought to the surface an inherent conflict between two principles of Mr. Obama’s counterterrorism strategy: his effort to impose constraints on airstrikes outside war zones, as reflected in the 2013 rules, and his “light footprint” approach of building up and working with partner forces rather than using American forces to occupy countries. One problem, the officials said, is that the 2013 rules were written against the backdrop of operations at the time in Yemen, in which drones based abroad flew over the country, took planned shots and flew out again. But when American advisers are on the ground working with partners, as they are in Somalia, both the Americans and their partners attract fire or get into combat situations and need to be defended. “I think it’s a real tension,” said Luke Hartig, who was the senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council until this year. “We ask countries to go into the fight against our counterterrorism adversaries, but we have a stated policy of not using force against groups unless they pose a continuing and imminent threat to Americans. ” “At the same time, we don’t want to just be everyone’s air force,” said Mr. Hartig, who is now a fellow at New America, a think tank in Washington. The administration decided against exempting Somalia from the 2013 rules because its adherence to limits intended to avoid civilian casualties was seen as helping to maintain partner support for American operations. Another aspect of the dilemma the administration faces, the officials said, centers in part on the War Powers Resolution, a   War law that limits combat deployments that Congress has not authorized to 60 days. After the March 5 airstrike, the administration argued that the War Powers Resolution limits did not apply to strikes made both to aid African Union forces battling the Shabab and to defend American advisers. The idea was that Americans had been deployed to Somalia in part to counter   Shabab elements, so the 2001 authorization covered their presence and strikes to defend them from any threat. But as American partners have been going after the Shabab in general more often without any particular focus on individuals linked to Al Qaeda, it has been harder to point to any congressional authorization for such airstrikes that would satisfy the War Powers Resolution. As the election neared, the administration decided it would be irresponsible to hand off Somali counterterrorism operations to Mr. Obama’s successor with that growing tension unresolved. Now, as Mr. Zenko pointed out, “this administration leaves the Trump administration with tremendously expanded capabilities and authorities. ”": "22551",
    "Sen. Jeff Sessions appeared on Breitbart News Daily with host Stephen K. Bannon on Monday to discuss his endorsement of Donald Trump for President, noting that “a Trump election would kill the advancement of that   [Trans Pacific Partnership trade] agreement. ”[Sessions said he was impressed with the size of the crowd for his endorsement, and its energy.  “That stadium was filled,” he said of his appearance with Trump at the Madison City Schools stadium on Sunday.  “There were people from all categories of life.  You know, you had your young people with tattoos and things, you had some of the best civic and business people in the community  …     it was really sort of an expression of national concern about the country, and they’re seeing in Donald Trump a force that they think could break through the logjams we’re in, and advance America in a good way. ”  Sessions praised Trump for listening to American voters’ desire for a “lawful system of immigration” that “serves the national interest, and that is good for the people of America. ”   He also found voters to be “uneasy about these trade agreements that have not worked as promised, and they want us to slow down and protect American manufacturing and jobs. ” The Senator conceded that Trump is “not a perfect person,” and advised him to “clean up his speeches some, and be more focused” on these winning issues, but gave him credit for being a “smart and capable” leader who could bring new voters into the Republican Party. Sessions was especially forceful in his criticism of the Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement, which he saw as a serious threat to American sovereignty, as well as a menace to the economic interests of   voters. “I believe the advancement of the   partnership, with this   commission  —   the Pacific commission that would be created here, where each of our Pacific partners in that trade agreement, if it were adopted, would get one vote, and they set rules, they can change the rules, without Congress, without the permission of the American people  —   I think that’s a huge mistake,” he said.  “It absolutely should not happen. ” Unfortunately, Sessions added, his friend Senator Marco Rubio “voted for it, and he says it’s one of the three pillars of his foreign policy.  That worries me.  Trump is clear, and I think a Trump election would kill the advancement of that   agreement. ” He wanted a new deal, negotiated from a position of strength, with the understanding that America’s trade partners need us more than we need them  …     by a President who “understands that we’re not going to lose a single job as a result of an unfair trading agreement. ” Sessions saw the Gang of Eight immigration bill as another bad deal, made without due consideration for the needs of the American people, and criticized Rubio as the chief spokesman for that effort. He recalled advising the Gang of Eight to have law enforcement in the room when they designed the bill, including representatives of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers who could have explained “the loopholes and the problems, and the frustrations they have with trying to enforce the law. ” “But they didn’t want them,” Sessions noted ruefully.  “They had La Raza there, they had the Chamber of Commerce there  …     they had other special interest groups, the ACLU  …     the American people weren’t there, and law enforcement was not there. ”  Listen to the full audio of Sessions interview below: Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 weekdays from 6:00AM to 9:00AM EST.": "35029",
    "Presidential candidate Ted Cruz laid out a strategy to “build a wall” along the United States border as a paramount portion of his plan to solve illegal immigration.  During Saturday night’s Republican Presidential debate in New Hampshire he added, referring to Donald Trump, “I’ve got somebody in mind to build it. ” Moderator David Muir asked Cruz about his immigration plan and how he would deal with “11. 5 million undocumented people. ” Cruz responded: So, in terms of a practical solution, I’ve laid out the most detailed plan for solving illegal immigration. It’s 11 pages,   chapter and verse. It’s on our website, tedcruz. org. In short, we’re going to do, we’re going to build a wall. We’re going to triple the border patrol. We’re going to increase  —   and actually, since Donald enjoyed that, I will simply say, I’ve got somebody in mind to build it. We’re going to increase   the   and   aircraft, so that you have technology monitoring an attempted incursion to direct the boots on the ground where they’re occurring. We’re going to put in place a strong   system in the workplace, so you can’t get a job without proving you are here legally. We’ll put in place a biometric   system on visas, because 40 percent of illegal immigration comes not over the border illegally, but people coming on visas and overstaying. We will end sanctuary cities by cutting off taxpayer dollars to any jurisdiction that defies federal immigration law. After audience applause Cruz added, “And we will end welfare benefits for those here illegally. ” Muir tried to push Cruz asking how he would deal with those families in the U. S. illegally. Cruz replied: What you do is, you enforce the law. You know, under the Constitution, the president has an obligation to, quote, “Take care that the laws be faithfully executed. ” Federal immigration law provides, if someone is here illegally and is apprehended, they are to be deported. We saw just this past week the head of the border patrol union testify before Congress that President Obama had given the order to the border patrol to stand down, not to enforce the law. That is wrong. I will enforce the law, and for everyone who says, you can’t possibly do that, I would note that in eight years, Bill Clinton deported 12 million people. In eight years, George W. Bush deported 10 million people. Enforcing the law  —   we can do it. What is missing is the political will. And when they were deporting the people, the border wasn’t secure, so they’d come right back. Once you secure the border, enforcing the law will solve this problem and that will benefit American workers. The three main points of the Cruz Immigration plan are: •First, secure the border, once and for all. No other reform is meaningful if we do not fix our porous southern border. •Second, strengthen and enforce our existing immigration laws. We must reverse President Obama’s enforcement “priorities,” which allow a large number of criminal aliens to unlawfully remain in the United States. •Third, pursue reforms to the   system that will prioritize the interests and   of Americans. As a nation built by those fleeing persecution and seeking freedom, we must once against welcome and celebrate legal immigrants while at the same time protecting American jobs and interests.

    ", I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. Sometimes it seems the Internet is, at its core, a tremendous nostalgia machine. You are, at any given moment, just a few clicks and keystrokes away from local television that aired 40 years ago, from discontinued toys, and from sounds you haven’t heard in forever (or at all). It seems fitting, if not outright magical, for example, that the immersive virtual worlds of my youth —  computer games like Lemonade Stand (1979) The Oregon Trail (1979)  Choplifter (1982) Carmen Sandiego (1985) and Think Quick! (1987) —  are all playable online. Back when I was playing these games on my family’s Apple IIc, they were often   by a generation that had first encountered home computers as adults —  and distrusted gaming as a waste of time. If anything destroys the practice of reading once and for all, The New York Times warned in 1994, it will be computer games. Computer games did not destroy reading. Instead, games had a profound effect on the popular perception of computers. The ginormous machines of the 1960s and 1970s were viewed as either complex and boring or, in science fiction, threatening. “I think the fact that computers were primarily used to play games really helped to get people to accept that computers were good and helpful devices instead of the negative portrayals of them in the ‘60s and ‘70s in movies,” said John Romero, the   of id Software and the designer of several hugely popular games including Wolfenstein 3D (1992) Doom (1993) and Quake (1996). Games also shaped people’s understanding of what computers are for —  and what humankind’s relationship with such machines could be like. Computers were serious tools, yes, but they could enable exploration and experimentation, too. Computers weren’t just expensive calculators or advanced typewriters they were fun. “I strongly believe that games have been largely underrated in the spread of what we might think of as our ‘orientation’ toward computing,” said Laine Nooney, a cultural historian of video games and computing. “In the span of less that 20 years, many Americans went from having never seen a computer to interacting with these machines in many facets of their daily lives. Gaming is the first form of computational technology most of us ever handled   …     Games taught us principles of interaction and screen responsiveness, about coordination between hand and eye, how to type, how to sit, how to look at a screen. ” Early games also served a crucial function in the shaping the broader culture of computing —  including promoting central ideas about openness and sharing that would eventually become foundational values of the web. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, game makers —  like anyone who found themselves tinkering with computers at the time —  were inclined to share what they learned, and to build on one another’s designs.  This dynamic was, Nooney says, an “outgrowth of the general need for a decently sized but geographically disparate group of microcomputer users to trade knowledge. ”   The thriving culture of early computing magazines was a direct byproduct of this need —  people helped debug each other’s code, swapped tips about hardware, and generally supported one another. “It wasn’t uncommon for for someone who had written in with a question and included their address to receive a phone call from another computer user helping them with their question —  since all another reader had to do was get the operator on the phone and request a lookup by name and town,” Nooney said. “The Apple II is really a product of the hacker culture which originally came from universities —  they were the only organizations able to afford mainframes and later minicomputers but still allow freedom to play and experiment,” said Bill Budge, the legendary game designer who created Raster Blaster (1981) and other early games. “Certainly, the Apple II exposed more people to computers than was possible at universities. When I started at Google, I was surprised by how many engineers had played my games as kids and been inspired to pursue tech at a very early age. So the Apple II was definitely an accelerator of hacker culture. ” That same culture, and the premium it placed on openness, would eventually carry over to the early web: a platform that anyone could build on, that no one person or company could own. That idea is at the heart of what proponents for net neutrality are trying to protect —  that is, the belief that openness is a central value, perhaps even the foundational value, of what is arguably the most important technology of our time. But there isn’t a straight line from early computing culture to early web culture —  even though many of the same players were involved in early game development and early online communities. In fact, in the   at a time when many Americans were buying personal computers for the first time, the open culture that once permeated gaming (and computing in general) changed dramatically. “Nintendo arrives on the scene just about the time the Macintosh does, and it has a similar effect on computing by advancing the idea that closed systems —  designed systems that users don’t fool around with —  are the way to go,” said Henry Lowood, a historian of technology at Stanford University Libraries. It wasn’t just Nintendo or Apple. The open culture at Atari had already begun to shift, for instance, when it was acquired by Warner Communications in the late 1970s. At the time, Warren Robinett, who designed Adventure for Atari’s 2600 —  the first graphical video game of its kind —  was told not to work on the game by supervisors who didn’t think the concept would be possible, given the memory constraints of computing systems of the era. “I worked on it in secret,” Robinett told me. “I produced what you could call a feasibility demonstration, and I showed it to some of the other people at Atari. If [my boss] had been a more powerful person, he would have just crushed me. Adventure could have easily not happened if things had been slightly different. ” Adventure’s enormous impact on the future of gaming —  and, arguably, on the broader visual aesthetic of that would come to dominate the web —  is difficult to quantify. “I realize that to somebody who grew up after adventure games became commonplace, that it seems like Adventure was probably handed down from a mountain on a stone tablet, but it wasn’t,” Robinett said. “I was lucky that I was in the right place at the right time, and got to make one of those little innovations that had an impact and changed the way we do things. ” But technological progress has a way of seeming inevitable in retrospect. From the player’s perspective, the culture that defined the early web seemed similarly preordained —  like a natural extension of the dynamics that shaped virtual spaces in offline gaming. I grew up playing Think Quick, for example, a game released in 1987 by The Learning Company, which Robinett   after his time at Atari. The game involved exploring the rooms of a castle opening trap doors, finding secret objects, evading the dreaded slime worms, and eventually ousting a dragon. It also offered a mode called Castle Creator —  think of it as a kind of predecessor for creative mode in Minecraft —  that let players create their own levels. You could do everything from building the layout of the rooms to designing icons for hidden objects. Years later, when Romero created Doom, he took the idea of game modification a step further. Players could build their own levels, and in some cases entirely new games, using the game files that Doom made accessible to players. “Just the way there had been this interesting coincidence with Apple and Nintendo [introducing] these closed systems in 1984, there was another interesting coincidence that happens about 10 years later, and that coincidence is the launch of Doom and the web,” Lowood, the Stanford historian, told me. “Because Doom, the way it was architected, could be modified —  that has been looked at by people in the technology community as the beginning of open source. This sort of open culture reemerged. It’s a key thing —  open versus closed, sharing versus   —  and these tensions are really important parts of the history of computing. ” The cultural standing of video games, meanwhile, has only grown in the mobile Internet age. Even during the economic recession, the video game sector in the United States grew 9. 6 percent and added $6. 2 billion to the economy —  outpacing the entire national economy four times over, according to CNET. “I don’t think its too much of an exaggeration to say games are everywhere,” Lowood said. “There are   systems built into a lot of parts of our lives. Games have to be seen not just as the specific   but also a part of the story of the impact of technology on our lives, a part of the story of different ways of learning, different ways of doing business. All of these changes that have occurred as a result of technology, games are a big part of those stories. ”             Like this?

    "Hillary Clinton preached to the faithful, Donald Trump embraced his   Staten Islander and Bernie Sanders attracted throngs of young supporters in Brooklyn on Sunday as candidates made a final weekend push for votes ahead of Tuesday’s huge New York primary. Clinton sought to consolidate her African American following, telling congregants at Grace Baptist Church in Mt. Vernon that she’ll “preserve and build on the progress that President Obama has made. ” But the former secretary of state gently distanced herself from the 1994 crime bill signed into law by husband Bill Clinton, which has led to record incarceration of young black men. “I will do everything I can   …     to reform the criminal justice system to confront systemic racism,” she said. “We will tackle the problem of mass incarceration. ” The Democratic frontrunner hopes a strong New York showing Tuesday can finally shake off challenger Sanders, riding a wave of enthusiastic young voters. The Vermont senator is speaking in Prospect Park at 4 p. m.  but hordes of his supporters were already at the event hours early. On the Republican side, frontrunner Trump told supporters at the Hilton Garden Inn that he has fond memories working summers on the island for his real estate magnate dad. “I love Staten Island. Tysens Park,” he said. “I worked on Staten Island for four summers. I love it. The greatest people. ” When asked where his favorite slice of pizza in the borough known for good slices, Trump responded: “I have a lot of them  …    Denino’s is good. ” Trump has been winning primaries, he’s struggled capturing delegates at various state conventions. He’s endured recent beatings, by Ted Cruz, in Wyoming and Colorado. Trump said he didn’t put any effort there, whining that those competitions were “rigged. ” “When it’s up to the bosses  —   we didn’t play in Colorado, because I heard that it was going to be for the bosses, for the RNC,” he told supporters. “I’m not going to waste a lot of money. Don’t forget, I’m self funding. We didn’t play there, we didn’t play in Wyoming because the game was rigged. That’s what you have to do, take them on trips, put them in hotel rooms. I don’t want to play that game. ” Trump has the most pledged delegates going Tuesday’s battle, he’s facing a steep hill to make the magic number of 1, 237 delegates before the GOP convention in Cleveland in July.

    "From Alia Wong  The Absurdity of College Admissions, Acceptance rates at highly selective colleges have plummeted in recent years.  Exclusivity has always been baked into their brand: Only about 3 percent of    in the U. S. go to schools that admit fewer than half their applicants, making the “  mania,” as The Atlantic’s Derek Thompson once put it, “a crisis for the 3 percent. ” Still, it’s a mania to which more and more teens are subjecting themselves, pressuring applicants to pad their resumés and tout superficial experiences and hobbies, convincing them that attending a prestigious school is paramount. And critics say that mania has even spread into and shaped American culture, often distorting kids’ (and parents’) values, perpetuating economic inequality, and perverting the role of higher education in society as a whole. * * * In Pursuit of Integration, Although Brown v. Board of Education decided more than six decades ago that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional, children today are more racially and socioeconomically isolated than they have been in decades. Critics often attribute that regression in part to the failure of policymakers to take action —  policymakers like [former Education Secretary Arne] Duncan, who in a   episode of This American Life last August acknowledged, “We haven’t done enough. ” [Education Secretary John] King wants to change that: “We must find ways to make our schools better reflections of the diverse society we have become. ” * * * Asian Americans and the Future of Affirmative Action, It’s sad that this is what   admissions have come to: a   process that encourages students to distort their identities solely for the sake of getting in. But the rampant racism to which these pointers allude, if real, is even sadder. According to some activists, brilliant, accomplished, and   Asian students are consigned to gaming a system that’s rigged against them. Either that, or they have to prove themselves extra brilliant, extra accomplished, and extra   to ensure they’re on equal footing with   applicants. The premise is that affirmative action enables colleges and universities to discriminate against Asian applicants simply because there are so many of them on campus already. * * * Escaping the Disability Trap, Today, more than 1 million students are trapped in an education system that wasn’t built for them. That system wasn’t designed to accommodate their disabilities —  the kinds of intellectual, cognitive, communicative, and physical conditions that often conjure images of people reliant on wheelchairs and aides, of individuals consigned to dreary, isolated lives. Many of the public schools they attend rest on the assumption that those stereotypes are inevitable truths. But these students, even those with the most severe disabilities, have potential far beyond what they are often educated for. From Emily DeRuy, Across the Border and Into School, In the past several years, more than 100, 000 children from Central America have fled the violence and poverty of their home countries to travel north —  often all alone —  for the chance at a better life in the United States.   …     As with most young people, school is the daily constant that anchors their lives. For many of these undocumented children, their waking hours are spent mostly in classrooms, where they are attempting to navigate a completely foreign education system. The law is clear: All children in the United States, regardless of immigration status, have the right to a quality   education. * * * Judge’s Football Team Loses, Juvenile Sentences Go Up  Kids who are sentenced by    judges who are disappointed after unexpected team losses are finding themselves behind bars for longer than kids who are sentenced after wins or predicted losses. That’s the gist of a new working paper by a pair of economists at Louisiana State University. It sounds almost comical, like an Onion headline, at first glance: “Judge Sentences Teen to Two Years After Louisiana Tigers Fall to Wisconsin Badgers. ” But, insists Naci Mocan, an economics professor at LSU and a   (with a fellow professor, Ozkan Eren) of “Emotional Judges and Unlucky Juveniles,” it’s not far off. * * * The Tricky Pursuit of Diversity at the Air Force Academy, Educators and military officials are grappling with shifting demographics, where the people in leadership roles look less and less like the people they are charged with serving. At colleges across the country, the overwhelming whiteness of those in power has prompted Black Lives Matter activists to call for more diversity. At the Pentagon, the Defense Department is looking for creative ways to fight an enemy that is less predictable and more amorphous. Both tasks require a delicate balance of preservation and evolution, of security and openness. As the leader of both an elite institution of higher learning and a key piece of the military pipeline, [Lieutenant General Michelle] Johnson, [the superintendent of the U. S. Air Force Academy,] sits at the nexus. “We’re trying to deliver this traditional mission in a relevant way to this generation and to the profession of arms,” she said. * * * A Plan to Teach Every Child Computer Science  And after more than a year of work, a carefully crafted yet adaptable framework for what   education should look like at each grade level went live this week. The writers hope it will help more states craft standards and ultimately bring the subject to classrooms across the country. The   Computer Science Framework is a “response to the history of inequity in computer science,” said Pat Yongpradit, the chief academic officer at Code. org, one of the organizations steering the initiative. From Hayley Glatter, Should Students Learn About Black Lives Matter in School? If the Chicago   teacher Gregory Michie waits for a textbook to teach his students about the Black Lives Matter movement, the first   to hear the lesson won’t be born for another seven years. Despite the historical implications of that movement, bureaucratic timelines all but quash any possibility that students might learn about today’s events from an actual history textbook in the near future. The Gendered Past of Typing Education, Over time, typing education has evolved in tandem with both the progression of computer technology and the decreasing age at which students are exposed to that technology. Today, that age may be reaching its lowest limit, as standardized tests and metrics emphasize the need for exceedingly young learners to successfully navigate a computer. These histories, Darren Wershler, the author of The Iron Whim: A Fragmented History of Typewriting, said, are inseparable from the history of writing itself. * * * The CEOs of Sorority Row, According to the National Science Foundation, there was a 6. 4 percent increase in the number of women intending to major in science and engineering fields between 1995 and 2012. On top of that, the National Panhellenic Council reports its undergraduate membership was 58 percent higher in 2015 than it was in 2007. And so it follows that as women become more likely to study   fields, so too are women who decide to “go Greek. ” And yet, even as presumably more and more women are balancing what it means to be both technically minded and involved in Greek life, the stigmas associated with sororities continue to range from the foolishly feminine to the flagrant.    * * * Where Do Schools Close Most Often for Weather? The frequency with which some districts around the country cancel classes warrants a closer look at closure policies. Districts have their own sets of guidelines for determining when the weather is too difficult to overcome, and while each area deals with specific forecasts and challenges, the variance between states is stark. Many districts outline on their websites that a primary priority when considering a   closure is the safety of students and faculty, but the ramifications of an unplanned day off extend past chilly toes and spilled cocoa. From our contributors, Why Do Colleges Have So Much Art? Jacoba Urist,  Public or private, rural or urban, college museums are tackling ambitious projects like never before, promoting academic curators —  who were once part of a sleepier, insular art world —  to be lead actors on the cultural stage. But not everyone agrees that school museums should compete with their mainstream counterparts or that students necessarily benefit more from having art of such magnitude as opposed to more modest collections. The ongoing art wave raises questions about whether college museums have outlived their primary purpose as educational institutions and perhaps now serve a different function in both academic and art circles. * * * The Unmanufactured Impact of a Plastic Best Friend, Erik Raschke, For an autistic mind, a question is vastly different than it would be for a   mind. “Are you my best friend?” is more philosophical than literal, an abstract pondering, an eccentric artist examining an established truth. My son is 10 years old, but he does not know how old he is. He does not know which country we live in. He cannot tie his shoes, brush his teeth, count higher than four. Only within the last month has he begun to remember his last name. Still, ever since he was first diagnosed with his neurodevelopmental condition at the age of 3, I have always recognized the tenebrous clues of consciousness glowing behind his eyes. * * * Navigating Campus Together, Melissa Scholes Young,  Writing centers and campus counselors and   programs want students to succeed. But as a   college student I avoided all of them, assuming I couldn’t afford the extra bill. Now, as college faculty, I want my students to know what I didn’t. According to College Board, more than 30 percent of today’s undergraduate students are the first in their families to go to college.   of   students attend community college, many  . They are disproportionately minorities from   backgrounds. And even for those of us who win the elusive admission ticket, three out of five won’t graduate with a bachelor’s degree. Very few of us attend graduate school. * * * Black History Month in Schools —  Retire or Reboot?  Melinda Anderson,  First celebrated in 1976, Black History Month was the result of a growing racial pride and consciousness of black Americans and Woodson’s association pushing to expand the weekly celebration. Now a   nationally recognized observance, Black History Month is a commemoration that might be short in days but is increasingly long on controversy. In the last month —  in examples that cross racial boundaries —  the black actress and conservative commentator Stacey Dash called to eliminate Black History Month, labeling it a vestige of segregation, while Republicans in the Kansas legislature questioned if an entire month dedicated to honoring black history was “too long. ” And be sure to check out our Educational Eden project.

Women bringing in the new year in downtown Bangalore, the country’s cosmopolitan IT hub, were surrounded and groped by mobs of pushing, shoving, handsy men. Photos and videos captured that night show young women trying to push through crowds of up to 300 men pressing in on them. Some of the women were crying, some yelling, others were being defended by their friends. Many of the women said they used their shoes to beat off gropers. A short distance away, an emcee walked out of his event and stumbled upon 25 men threatening a group of women. According to some women on the scene, not only was the harassment frightening, the apathy of cops who looked away and didn’t intervene was worse. In the days that have followed, the official stance on the mass harassment has done somersaults. First the police vowed to punish the offenders and called on the victims to file police complaints. Three days later, the police said they found no street camera footage to support the claims of sexual harassment, although the police commissioner has since said there is ”credible evidence” of the attacks. And then came the remarks of home minister G. Parameshwara, one of the highest ranking officials in the state of Karnataka, of which Bangalore is the capital. He went on record to say: ”Youngsters . .. try to copy the Westerners not only in the mindset but even the dressing. So some disturbance, some girls are harassed, these kind of things do happen.” On January 3, Abu Azmi of Mumbai, the state leader of a political party, said on national TV: ”If my sister or daughter is roaming around on December 31 with random men who aren’t their husband or brother, I don’t think that’s right.” He added, ”If there’s petrol near fire, it will burn. If there is sugar, ants will come.” His words were highlighted in angry tweets. Trisha Shetty, a lawyer, is the   of SheSays, a nonprofit group that educates young women about their rights, especially in the areas of sexual violence. She said the responses from officials were reprehensible. ”We reject this sense of entitlement men have over women’s bodies, sexuality and spaces,” she said. And, she added, the display of such parochial mindsets from people in charge of ensuring safety in public spaces is a huge setback for women. Meanwhile, on social media the #NotAllMen hashtag started to trend the next day defending men who didn’t do it, arguing that women were generalizing their anger. Japleen Pasricha, who runs the Feminism in India platform, was a critic of #NotAllMen tweets: ”The #NotAllMen tag detracted from the conversation, hijacked the narrative, and moved it away from how to deal with what’s happening. We’re not saying all men do this, but we do know all women are harassed.” To counter it, Feminism In India and Pasricha dusted off the globally used #YesAllWomen hashtag. Their tweet inviting Indian women to share their stories of public harassment, assault and abuse has been retweeted more than 900 times, with at least 1, 000 responses, says Pasricha. Sharing stories publicly may not change too many minds (although one Twitter troll changed his handle to ”I’m sorry” after being taken to task for sexism) m says Pasricha, ”But, mainly we wanted to take the narrative back.” A petition has been floated demanding unconditional apologies from the politicians, and on January 21 solidarity marches will be held in seven cities: Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Pune and Kolkata, organized and supported by 18 organizations, including Take Back the Night and Why Loiter, under the umbrella hashtag #IWillGoOut2017, Will a march make a difference? In late 2012 and early 2013, protests and vigils took place across the country, but soon other issues overtook demands for women’s safety. ”In the wake of the Nirbhaya case [the 2012 rape] the nation was in fervor  —   taking to the streets, debating on various media outlets,” the organizers of the #IWillGoOut march told me in a collectively authored email. ”Some blamed her and her partner. Some fathers vowed to never send their daughters out again because the world was cruel to them. Is this how we deal with assault? By limiting the freedoms and mobility of half the population?” What’s more, cases of sexual attack are on the rise. Data shows that police reports of assault on women rose 92 percent from 42, 968 in 2011 to 82, 422 in 2015. But conviction rates declined by 5 percent. In Karnataka, the rate of conviction is 1. 2 percent. Sukriti Gupta,   at the Academy For Earth Sustainability, an environment education organization, said she’s still hopeful of making a difference. ”I strongly believe reclaiming public space, making our voices heard, is important to remind and encourage others, especially women, that there is a support system out there  —   that we have a right and a place in our country, at night, regardless of what we wear.” Plus, she said, ”the visual nature of marches can cross socioeconomic barriers and provide food for thought for those who are normally not engaged in   press such as women and young girls living in more conservative families and slum areas.” The organizers of the march told me that the Bangalore harassment was not an isolated incident: ”It is a visible part of systemic inequality that prevents, hinders and shames half the population from moving around their cities, their homes. It is time to stake a claim in our landscape and our rights to own the streets and go out!” India’s tourism minister expressed the opposite perspective in August 2016. After high profile rape cases across the country, some involving foreign tourists, in August 2016 Mahesh Sharma advised foreign visitors to avoid wearing skirts and venturing out at night: ”For their own safety, women foreign tourists should not wear short dresses and skirts,” he said, because ”Indian culture is different from the Western.” This attitude toward safety seems to have been a contentious issue even a century ago. The Twitter account for the Why Loiter group has shared a quote from 1905 that mocks how keeping women safe means locking them up rather than changing or punishing the attitudes that endanger them.": "160812",
    "A high school boy in Pennsylvania was humiliated and emotionally harmed by being forced to share a locker room and bathrooms with a transgender boy, according to a lawsuit filed by a top religious conservative group, which ripped an argument from the progressive playbook and turned it on its head. The suit says that Joel Doe, an anonymous name for the high school junior, was changing his outfit for a PE class last October when he noticed the transgender boy, whom the lawsuit refers to as female. “When he was standing in his underwear about to put his gym clothes on, he suddenly realized there was a member of the opposite sex changing with him in the locker room, who was at the time wearing nothing but shorts and a bra,” according to the complaint filed on Tuesday in US District Court. “Plaintiff has experienced embarrassment and humiliation, both in terms of being viewed and viewing a student of the opposite sex in a state of undress and because of the stigmatization and criticism he received from other students and adults,” the complaint continues, noting that he “also fears the future embarrassment of meeting students of the opposite sex in the bathroom when simply relieving himself. ” By allowing the transgender student to share the facilities, the lawsuit alleges, the Boyertown Area School District has violated the boy’s civil and constitutional rights. Lawyers at Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian advocacy legal group representing the plaintiff, have asked a federal judge to suspend a school policy that lets transgender students use facilities that match their gender identity. “He also fears the future embarrassment of meeting students of the opposite sex in the bathroom when simply relieving himself. ” The case inverts arguments made in the past by several transgender students in other lawsuits that attempt to overturn   rules that restrict access to bathrooms. Among those students is Gavin Grimm, whose   case is winding through federal appeals courts. In those cases, transgender students have argued that Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which bans discrimination on the basis of sex, and the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment ensure students can use facilities that match their gender identity. A federal judge in Pennsylvania’s western district upheld that view in February. But the suit filed in the state’s eastern district on Tuesday claims the same civil rights law has the opposite effect  —   thereby making   school restroom policies illegal. Because Title IX allows for   facilities as a general matter, the complaint says, only people identified as male at birth may enter facilities designated for boys, and vice versa. The suit adds that the 14th Amendment guarantees privacy from people of a different birth sex in those facilities. The case inverts arguments made by several transgender students in other lawsuits. “The policy harms Doe because unless he surrenders his right to bodily privacy, he can no longer use the locker room designed for use by boys,” the suit says. After seeing the transgender boy partially undressed, Doe complained to school officials “that there was a girl in their locker room,” the lawsuit says. But the school principal allegedly told him that “students who mentally identify themselves with the opposite sex could choose the locker room and bathroom to use, and physical sex did not matter. ”The principal also allegedly told the boy to “tolerate” the situation and act as naturally as possible. The boy reportedly felt so uncomfortable by the threat of sharing locker rooms with the transgender boy that he didn’t change clothes before PE, instead opting to wear street clothes  —   which has “resulted in disciplinary action and poor grades. ” Ever since the incident, the boy “does not feel secure in the locker rooms or restrooms that are properly set aside for the exclusive use of boys to protect their privacy from exposure to members of the opposite sex,” the suit says. Lawyers add that the boy “now avoids using the restroom during the school day because of the ongoing risk of having his privacy violated. ” “The anxiety, embarrassment, and stress he feels as a direct result of [the school district’s] practice and actions has caused him to refrain from using restrooms as much as possible, stress about when and if he can use a given restroom without running into persons of the opposite sex, and opting to hold his bladder rather than using the school’s restroom,” the suit says.

    "This wasn’t how this postseason was supposed to go. For the past few months it has been an article of faith that the Western Conference would come down to the San Antonio Spurs and the Golden State Warriors. Throughout the regular season, the two teams looked like they were playing on a completely different level then the rest of the league. That’s why it was downright jarring to see the Thunder thoroughly dismantle the Spurs last night in Game 6. With their   victory, Oklahoma City clinched a trip to the Western Conference finals. The Spurs, their season having come to an abrupt end, now have to turn their attention to towards their uncertain future earlier than they had hoped. The Spurs were favored to win this series for a very good reason. San Antonio came into the postseason having won 67 games, a franchise record. In the first round of the playoffs they completely demolished the Memphis Grizzlies in a   sweep. Plus, they had home court advantage in the series against the Thunder, although it didn’t look like they would end up needing it after they beat the Thunder   in Game 1. By this point, uncertainty around Stephen Curry’s health and availability led to the Spurs becoming the favorites to win the NBA finals. Instead, San Antonio ended up winning just one more game after that. Even though the Spurs only lost once at home during the regular season, and that to the   Warriors, the Thunder found a way to beat the Spurs at ATT Center twice in the span of four games. On the brink of elimination, San Antonio played Game 6 with uncharacteristic desperation. As Spurs player after Spurs player tried and failed to get into an sort of offensive rhythm, Gregg Popovich, almost universally regarded as the best head coach in the NBA, kept making increasingly inexplicable substitutions as if hoping to stumble upon a combination that would work. He did not. By   the Spurs had scored just 31 points, a   and the Thunder were clearly in command. To their credit, the Spurs didn’t relent. In fact, there was a moment in the fourth quarter where it looked like the team had at least one more miracle comeback left in them. During this manic final run, the Spurs cut the Thunder lead, which was once as large as 28 points, to 11. Thunder fans, loud and boisterous for most of the game, became increasingly quiet, all too familiar with the signs of a potential late game collapse. Then the Spurs run came to a sudden, shocking end when Serge Ibaka blocked a Duncan   one he probably would have made just a few years ago. With that one swat, it was as if all the tension in the building was released at once. San Antonio never really threatened again. If you weren’t a Thunder fan, Duncan’s failed   might have brought on an unexpected rush of sadness. It’s always a difficult to watch the greats face their basketball immortality, but, as our DJ Gallo noted, it’s downright shocking when the player in question is Duncan, who staved off   decline for such a long time that it’s become his primary characteristic. In fact, for well over a decade, the Spurs’ identity has been tied to this concept that they’re the only constant in the   basketball world. Every year, the Spurs would be in the playoffs. Duncan, Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker would be three of the most important players on the court. That era is coming to an end. Duncan and Ginobili have player options for next season and could choose to retire. Even if they decide to return, it will be to serve as role players.  Don’t think of this as a eulogy, however. The Spurs are not going into rebuilding mode. While the Spurs might finally have reached the end of one era, the next one has already begun. With Kawhi Leonard, who placed second in this year’s MVP voting, they have maybe the most dangerous   player in the league. While LaMarcus Aldridge seemed to be like a luxury item when the Spurs signed him during the offseason, it looks like he’ll be a crucial part of the next version of the Spurs. Popovich will be head coach for however long he wants to continue in that role. Unless something goes terrible awry, they should be an attractive to free agents for the foreseeable future simply because their track record of success.  But, still, even if last night didn’t mark the end of the Spurs as one of the premier teams in the league, it certainly felt like the end of something. Something very real, if not entirely explicable. For an entire generation of NBA fans, Duncan, Ginobili and Parker are the Spurs and have always been the Spurs. What could this team possibly look like without them?": "152556",
    "Wall Street’s   about Apple’s merger and acquisition prospects is starting to look like post time at the Kentucky Derby. Citigroup’s Apple analyst James Suva threw his hat into the ring Friday, covering every conceivable base. Suva suggests the most likely options for Apple are Netflix (40 percent odds) and Disney (25 percent odds). Citi also suggested Apple might even scoop up Elon Musk’s   manufacturer Tesla (5 percent odds) or   makers including Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, or   Interactive (10 percent each). Suva’s   is prompted by bets that the globe’s most profitable company will benefit from the Trump Administration’s desire for US corporations to bring cash back into the country in return for a lower tax rate. Apple has some $257 billion in cash on its books and has not provided  . But some, including Citi’s Suva, believe Apple could be considering a move to buy a video streaming service. The company’s business selling downloadable music and media has seen declines as consumers move to online streaming instead. Talk of an   combination has also been heating up in the past few months. The Associated Press pointed out a merger would create the world’s first   company. Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told the AP in an interview published on Tuesday, “We are looking at every size of acquisition, so we will see how it goes going forward. ” Apple CEO Tim Cook has historically been cautious about big deals. Many thought Apple   which instead accepted an offer from AT&T. Apple shares closed the Friday session at $148. 96, up 1. 7 percent. Cook did spend $3 billion in 2014,   to help it carve an identity for its Apple Music streaming service.": "130565",
    "It’s the dead of winter in Stockholm and I’m sitting in a very small room inside the very inaptly named Calm Body Modification clinic. A few feet away sits the syringe that will, soon enough, plunge into the fat between my thumb and forefinger and deposit a   microchip roughly the size of an engorged grain of rice. “You freaking out a little?” asks Calm’s proprietor, a heavily tattooed man named Chai, as he runs an   cotton swab across my hand. “It’s all right. You’re getting a microchip implanted inside your body. It’d be weird if you weren’t freaking out a little bit. ” Of Course It Fucking Hurts! his   admonishes in bold type. My choice to get microchipped was not ceremonial. It was neither a transhumanist statement nor the fulfillment of a childhood dream born of afternoons reading science fiction. I was here in Stockholm, a city that’s supposedly left cash behind, to see out the extreme conclusion of a monthlong experiment to live without cash, physical credit cards, and, eventually, later in the month,   currency altogether, in a bid to see for myself what the future of money  —   as is currently being written by Silicon Valley  —   might look like. Some of most powerful corporations in the world  —   Apple, Facebook, and Google the Goliaths, the big guys, the companies that make the safest bets and rarely lose  —   are pouring resources and muscle into the payments industry, historically a complicated,   business. Meanwhile, companies like Uber and Airbnb have been forced to become payments giants themselves, helping to facilitate and process millions of transactions (and millions of dollars) each day. A recent report from the auditor KPMG revealed that global investment in fintech  —   financial technology, that is  —   totaled $19. 1 billion in 2015, a 106% jump compared to 2014 venture capital investment alone nearly quintupled between 2012 and last year. In 2014, Americans spent more than $3. 68 billion using    tech, according to eMarketer. In 2015, that number was $8. 71 billion, and in 2019, it’s projected to hit $210. 45 billion. As Apple CEO Tim Cook told (warned?) a crowd in the U. K. last November, “Your kids will not know what money is. ” To hear Silicon Valley tell it, the   leather wallet is on life support. I wanted to pull the plug. Which is how, ultimately, I found myself in this sterile Swedish backroom staring down a syringe the size of a pipe cleaner. I was here because I wanted to see the future of money. But really, I just wanted to pay for some shit with a microchip in my hand. The first thing you’ll notice if you ever decide to surrender your wallet is how damn many apps you’ll need in order to replace it. You’ll need a mobile credit card replacement  —   Apple Pay or Android Pay  —   for starters, but you’ll also need    payment apps like Venmo, PayPal, and Square Cash. Then don’t forget the  : Dwolla, Tilt, Tab, LevelUp, SEQR, Popmoney, P2P Payments, and Flint. Then you might as well embrace the cryptocurrency of the future, bitcoin, by downloading Circle, Breadwallet, Coinbase, Fold, Gliph, Xapo, and Blockchain. You’ll also want to cover your bases with individual retailer payment apps like Starbucks, Walmart, USPS Mobile, Exxon Speedpass, and Shell Motorist, to name but a few. Plus public and regular transit apps  —   Septa in Philadelphia, NJ Transit in New Jersey, Zipcar, Uber, Lyft. And because you have to eat and drink, Seamless, Drizly, Foodler, Saucey, Waitress, Munchery, and Sprig. The future is fractured. This isn’t lost on Bryan Yeager, a senior analyst who covers payments for eMarketer. “This kind of piecemeal fragmentation is probably one of the biggest inhibitors out there,” he said. “I’ll be honest: It’s very confusing, not just to me, but to most customers. And it really erodes the value proposition that mobile payments are simpler. ” On a frigid January afternoon in Midtown Manhattan, just hours into my experiment, I found myself at 2 Bros. a     pizza shop that operates with an aversion to frills. As I made my way past a row of stainless steel ovens, I watched the patrons in front of me grab their glistening slices while wordlessly forking over mangled bills, as has been our country’s custom for a century and a half. When my turn came to order, I croaked what was already my   phrase: “Do you, um, take Apple Pay?” The man behind the counter blinked four times before (wisely) declaring me a lost cause and moving to the next person in line. This kind of bewildered rejection was fairly common. A change may be coming for money, but not everyone’s on board yet, and Yaeger’s entirely correct that the “simple” value proposition hasn’t entirely come to pass. Paying with the wave of a phone, I found, pushes you toward extremes to submit to the will of one of the major mobile wallets is to choose between   retailers and chain restaurants and small, niche luxury stores. The only business in my Brooklyn neighborhood that took Apple Pay or Android Pay was a cafe where a large iced coffee runs upwards of $5 globally, most of the businesses that have signed on as Apple Pay partners are large national chains like Jamba Juice, Pep Boys, Best Buy, and Macy’s. Partially for this reason, the primary way most Americans are currently experiencing the great fintech boom isn’t through Apple or Android Pay at all, but through proprietary payment apps from chains such as Target, Walmart, and Starbucks  —   as of last October, an astonishing 1 in 5 of all Starbucks transactions in the U. S. were done through the company’s mobile app. It wouldn’t be all that hard to live a fully functional  —   if possibly boring  —     consumer life by tapping and swiping the proprietary apps of our nation’s biggest stores. If that doesn’t feel revolutionary or particularly futuristic, it’s because it’s not really meant to. But the future of mobile retail is assuredly dystopian. Just ask Andy O’Dell, who works for Clutch, a marketing company that helps with consumer loyalty programs and deals with these kinds of mobile purchasing apps. “Apple Pay and the Starbucks payment app have nothing to do with actual payments,” he told me. “The power of payments and the future of these programs is in the data they generate. ” Imagine this future: Every day you go to Starbucks before work because it’s right near your house. You use the app, and to ensure your reliable patronage, Starbucks coughs up a loyalty reward, giving you a free cup of coffee every 15 visits. Great deal, you say! O’Dell disagrees. According to him, Starbucks is just hurting its margins by giving you something you’d already be buying. The real trick, he argued, is changing your behavior. He offers a new scenario where this time, instead of a free coffee every 15 visits, you get a free danish  —   which you try and then realize it goes great with coffee. So you start buying a danish once a week, then maybe twice a week, until it starts to feel like it was your idea all along. In that case, O’Dell said, Starbucks has “changed my behavior and captured more share of my wallet, and they’ve also given me more of what I want. ” “That’s terrifying,” I told him. “But that’s the brave new world, man,” he shot back. “Moving payments from plastic swipes to digital taps is going to change how companies influence your behavior. That’s what you’re asking, right? Well, that’s how we’re doing it. ” In this sense, the payments rush is, in no small part, a data rush. Creating a wallet that’s just a digital version of the one you keep in your pocket is not the endgame. But figuring out where you shop, when you shop, and exactly what products you have an affinity for, and then bundling all that information in digestible chunks to inform the marketers of the world? Being able to, as O’Dell puts it, “drive you to the outcome they want you to have like a rat in a maze by understanding, down to your personality, who you are”? That’s disruption worth investing in. For all its complexity and bureaucracy and importance, money, at its core, is really just information. When FDR weaned the United States off the gold standard in 1933, cash, no longer backed by physical gold, became an abstraction. Today, that abstraction is pushed to new extremes: Not only does 92% of the money in the world exist as a series of ones and zeroes, but now it’s being transferred from place to place by any number of digital intermediaries looking to take a cut. That process is complicated, but the key issue is trust. Money, argues David Wolman in The End of Money, is not much more than “a belief in a shared purpose, or at least a shared hallucination. ” This faith in the “particular religion” of cash has been at the center of standardized currencies since Kublai Khan, and the loss of that faith has been associated with every major economic catastrophe in history. But trust  —   especially when it comes to new forms of currency  —   takes time to build. The first two weeks of my experiment, most people balked when I offered an alternative means of payment. “I’m a little worried this might not go through in time,” one server at a German beer hall told me when I asked if I could Venmo her for my bill. A waiter at a different establishment scoffed when I tried to pay him or the restaurant via PayPal, suggesting his manager would think he was getting ripped off. Yaeger sees this as standard for a nascent technology. “I kind of equate now to where things were 10 to 12 years ago with ” he told me. “The concept of putting credit cards on a screen was new. Retailers and normal people were concerned about that. So innovative companies like PayPal and Amazon built that trust up over a decade while others slowly moved in. ” There are, of course, legitimate reasons not to trust these new forms of payment. Anyone who’s been mugged or lost a wallet knows cash is far from perfect, but this constellation of new digital payment products introduces a whole new category and scale of ways to get robbed, hacked, scammed, and screwed. Venmo  —   the social payment service that’s now transferring over $1 billion per month  —   may, in some ways, be the truest glimpse at a mobile payment future, but it’s not exactly entirely secure. Smartphones can be as easily lost and stolen as wallets, but they’re also eminently breakable, orders of magnitude more expensive, and obsolete after two or three years. And the   landscape is still such that living cashlessly in 2016 means entering your credit card information or routing number into dozens of   apps, some of which look as if they’ve been built overnight by a high school computer science class. All this risk and all this friction, in the service of  …    what, exactly? “Plastic works really well,” Randy Reddig, an entrepreneur who was a part of Square’s founding team, told me, taking a shot at what he called “mobile wallet hysteria. ” “I have a wallet right now in my pocket, and it’s great. It can feel like this is something that nobody is asking for. It’s solutioneering: Take something that exists just fine in the meatspace world and make it digital and somehow we’re all supposed to believe it’s better. ” To Reddig, the true future of payments is revealing itself inside many of Silicon Valley’s biggest new companies. Airbnb, he said, has one of the most sophisticated payments infrastructures of any company in the world, handling deposits and disbursements in hundreds of markets, many with different currencies. “All the innovation around payments is a means to an end  —   table stakes,” he said. “Uber has one of, if not the most used mobile payments methods in the world, and it was absolutely crucial  —   they had to do it to create the experience and service they wanted. Payment technology created certainty for riders and drivers that they’d get paid  —   it facilitated trust. ” Much as the true value of a retailer’s mobile payment app is in the metadata it gobbles up, the real power of digital payments lies in the largely invisible infrastructure that undergirds them. Fintech companies like Square aren’t exactly sexy, but they allow small businesses and individual merchants to process transactions without prohibitively expensive equipment or the fees that legacy credit companies charge. “It’s about financial inclusion and serving real, normal people,” Reddig said. “There is a lot of opportunity to build very profitable businesses that operate better than incumbents in transparency, great design, great user experience. Millennials don’t trust banks, but they trust Apple and Google. ” This is already happening, just outside the U. S. If fintech’s true believers think it’ll fundamentally change the way we live, the developing world is where their vision is revealing itself most clearly. In Kenya, for example, the payment messaging service   has attracted over 13 million monthly active users (out of a population of 44. 3 million). As of last May, roughly 42% of Kenya’s GDP was transacted via   all without tying Kenyans to expensive, cumbersome bank accounts. But more than that,   has effectively invented a new form of credit that’s based on a history of reliable transactions from phone to phone, rather than through a bank. In a world where 2. 5 billion people don’t have bank accounts, systems like   are set to leapfrog Western banking the same way much of the developing world skipped the desktop and went straight to the smartphone for its computing needs. In reinventing money transfers,   and its ilk offer more than a new way to pay  —   they are opportunity engines, offering the ability to build credit in a world that previously shut them out. And in the process, there are billions to be made in transfer fees. By my third week, the cashless, frictionless future I’d hoped to live began to feel glitchy, burdensome, and alienating. I had to meticulously plan my every move hours or even days in advance  —   a haircut required me to convince my barber to start using Venmo, going out for a meal meant lining up a dining companion willing to submit to confused stares and     processes. One January afternoon, I found myself trying to persuade a prodigiously bearded,    barista named Michael to allow me to pay him personally via Square Cash for a coffee, which he would then pay the register for. After a confession that this was all for a story from me and a pity laugh from him, Michael reached for his phone, but not before he locked eyes with me. “I’m only doing this because I want you to write about how much this sucks for us,” he said. He went on to talk about a popular coffee app called Cups, which allows customers to order and pay all inside the phone. “It’s like, now everyone who comes in is a robot  —   they just stare at their phone and wait to have their name called. Nobody even looks at us,” he said. At this point, replacing my wallet with a phone struck me as little more than a shallow gimmick, an academic exercise, like living in a house   before the appliances work and the water and electricity have been switched on: It’s entirely doable, and chances are no one’s going to get hurt, but that’s an awful reason to do anything. I needed something more drastic, which is how I found Hannes Sjoblad, who told me, with surprisingly little fanfare, that he could make me a cyborg. When I contacted Sjoblad, whose LinkedIn profile lists him as the chief disruption officer at the Swedish biohacking group BioNyfiken, he’d been experimenting with NFC and RFID chip implants by hosting chipping parties for curious   . His xNT NFC chip is really just a prototype: Sjoblad’s implantees are guinea pigs testing out what they believe could become common uses for a technology that’s usually reserved for phones and credit cards. Sjoblad himself uses his as a replacement for his house keys, business cards, and bike locks. I asked him if I could use the chip  —   the same kind, more or less, that sits in and powers the Apple, Google, and Samsung Pay parts of our phones  —   to pay for things in a store he wasn’t sure, but he knew a programmer who could link it to a bitcoin wallet. We Skyped once and formalized plans to make me an implantee. “I think when you meet us you’ll see that we’re pretty normal mainstream persons,” he told me over a grainy video chat. “We’re not like some underground den of hackers. ” He let out the kind of nervous, mischievous laugh you might let slip if you ran an underground den of hackers. In the meantime, if I couldn’t bring the future to myself, I would have to do the next best thing: get into bitcoin. At its most basic, bitcoin is the very complicated product of advanced mathematics and cryptography, a “   system for online payments that does not require a trusted central authority. ” Bitcoin can be mined by those who donate part of their computing power to help verify the    transactions going on in bitcoin’s ecosystem via the blockchain, which is a string of bundled past transactions. (It’s a bit like if you loaned part of your computer to your bank to help it process payments across the world and got a very tiny reward for the donation). But bitcoin’s real beauty, according to its disciples, is that it’s not really governed by any entity, making it nonreversible, unfreezable, and anonymous, all with very low transaction fees. It’s a powerful idea, and bitcoin has been a bolded and underlined bullet point in every    argument. But in 2016, almost eight years since its creation, using bitcoin is a   exercise in frustration. If living without cards and cash meant planning all my purchases in painful detail, living without   currency of any kind only exacerbated the problem. To buy anything immediately out in the physical world, I had to use bitcoin to buy gift cards and then redeem them at the store for groceries, meals, and anything else. When I ran out of toilet paper, I loaded up Gyft, a digital gift card site, and purchased a $15 CVS card, which I then redeemed for Cottonelle as the store opened  —   all told, a   ordeal. Splitting the bill was impossible without a friend willing to set up their own bitcoin wallet, and sending money through bitcoin’s blockchain technology felt almost purposefully intimidating, with long, wonky wallet addresses, exchanges, and codes. And again, there’s trust  —   using bitcoin means transferring real money into a volatile currency, which hit home when bitcoin’s value dropped almost 18% just hours after I converted $800 dollars to book a flight. Though today bitcoin is niche but somewhat stable, it’s not exactly hard to imagine the whole thing melting down overnight. (As a challenge, my editor tasked me with buying something “tangible” with bitcoin’s jokey, basically defunct cousin, Dogecoin: I was rejected by a meme memorabilia merchant on Etsy when I asked to pay for a mug with a cartoon frog using Dogecoin. A new low.) But simply replacing paper dollars with digital ones isn’t the draw for bitcoin’s biggest advocates. Olaf   a    early employee at the bitcoin startup Coinbase, has been living almost exclusively on bitcoin for three years. “The exciting things are not where bitcoin competes with regular money,” he told me, “but where the tech is so radically different it creates new modes of behavior. ”   sees apps like Apple Pay as “abstraction layers,” basically just a digital copy of a common credit card  —   unlike bitcoin, which is a whole new platform. Adi Chikara, a strategist for 3Pillar Global who has been advising on and investing in companies using blockchain technology for years, sees its elegant, unbreakable cryptographic security as a new way to ensure trust. In some scenarios, he argues, blockchain technology can act as a replacement for currency as a whole. Imagine a system where legal contracts are automatically executed through the blockchain  —   for example, your monthly car payments are directly linked to your ability to unlock your vehicle and put it in gear. The particulars are complicated, but blockchain has the potential to act as a powerful reinvention of   bartering. It’s also, ultimately, maybe the only way to ever move past a   currency. “We had paper and it was backed by gold, and right now we’re trusting the government  —   but with the blockchain you may not necessarily need the state,” Chikara told me. The early signs of this are around today  —   Circle, for example, is a    money transfer app, similar to Venmo, which is powered by the blockchain, meaning, unlike Venmo, the payments are instantaneous and can easily be converted into different currencies without fees. Chikara readily admits we’re years, if not decades, away from a viable, universal   financial system. Like Venmo and Apple Pay and cash, bitcoin is still subject to human error, like in 2014, when the executive in charge of Mt. Gox, a popular cryptocurrency exchange, embezzled and lost hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin. But Chikara still proposes a scenario with no banks and no federal reserve. “There is no printing of money,” he said. “It’s owned jointly by the people themselves, and they trust each other. ” Blockchain technology is already being tested by traders across the world and has been implemented in the Australian stock exchange. IBM, Nasdaq OMX, Intel, and Cisco are exploring the blockchain and   open ledger projects for trading, along with banks like Wells Fargo and JPMorgan. And recently Goldman Sachs filed a patent for SETLCoin, the company’s very own   currency. But perhaps the best description of bitcoin’s potential came from Coinbase   Fred Ehrsam, who sees blockchain technology as nothing less than the most significant open platform since the web. “We take what was once a highly controlled system and turn it into a software development problem where people can go nuts,” he said. “And it becomes like the internet, where you have a big open network, people can build whatever they want. The market decides what’s good and what’s not. And before you know it, you have this great big open network that has all these great ideas on it and things can really start to get interesting. ” It was the beginning of week four and bitcoin had driven me deeper into my hermetic state  —   most of my purchases were being made online and my relation to the real world was almost exclusively conducted through a screen of some sort. I needed a change of scenery. As it turns out, if you yammer about the future of money long enough, somebody is likely to tell you to go to Sweden and see it for yourself. There, among the bountiful sweaters, sunless winters, and impossibly good genes, is the closest thing you’ll find to a truly cashless society. Just 20% of all consumer payments are conducted using cash in Sweden according to a 2015 survey, only 2% of Sweden’s economy revolves around the ancient, dirty exchange of paper money and coins. I booked my flight rather painlessly using bitcoin (thanks, Expedia!) to figure out how and why 9 million polite socialists have beaten the rest of us to the paperless money future. With its standing desks,   meeting rooms, and long corridors lined with stark    portraits, the office of Situation Stockholm looks like a startup. In fact, it’s almost the complete opposite: a    glossy print magazine sold primarily by the city’s homeless population. The portraits on the wall are of the magazine’s vendors, who are, incidentally, some of the first pioneers of cashless street busking. “A common response from presumptive customers was ‘Sorry, I don’t have any cash,’” Jenny Lindroth, an operations manager at the magazine, told me. “So we started to think of ways to take this cash business  —   a lot of our vendors don’t have bank accounts  —   digital. ” In 2007, Situation Stockholm started giving select vendors the ability to sell the magazine by having customers text a number, which would then add a charge to their cell phone bill. In 2013, the company bought card readers from a Swedish payment company called iZettle and sent its most reliable vendors out with them. Since then, Situation Stockholm has seen an uptick in sales for vendors, as well as a newfound agency. “People outside the country seem to think that it’s interesting or funny that homeless people have these phones and card readers, but it’s not really big news here in Sweden,” Lindroth said. “It’s just common practice now  —   in Sweden you don’t have cash. ” Walking around Stockholm’s icy cobblestoned sidewalks and winding,   alleyways, I found myself ducking into countless shops, bars, and konditori cafés, eavesdropping on checkout registers and craning my neck for a peek at local wallets. Not once did I see a paper bill. Paying by phone was commonplace, and I didn’t even get a weird look when I scanned a QR code at a grocery store checkout and wordlessly strolled away with my basket of smoked meats. According to Jacob de Geer, the CEO of iZettle, Sweden’s cashlessness can be traced back to the early 1990s, when tax subsidies encouraged citizens to buy early personal computers en masse, thereby making the country extra technologically adventurous. But all that early adoption hasn’t been easy for everyone. Swedish banks have drastically cut back on ATMs, raised cash transaction fees roughly 300% in the last four years, and made depositing as inconvenient as possible. Recently, Lindroth witnessed an elderly woman being turned away at the bank after she attempted to deposit a large amount of cash she’d been storing at home. “If she had transferred that money from her phone, she wouldn’t have been questioned in the same way. ” The problem, according to Björn Eriksson  —   a former head of the Swedish police and Interpol, and a prominent dissenting voice in the country’s rush to cashlessness  —   is not the end of paper money, but the speed of the transition, which is especially hard on older generations, those in rural areas, tourists, and new immigrants who come to the country without cards or bank accounts. “It’s gotten so that some people are resorting to hiding money in their microwave because they have nowhere to put it,” Eriksson told me. It can even be dangerous to public health: Just last September, Sweden’s highest court ruled against the Kronoberg County Health Authority and reprimanded them for not accepting cash as legal tender for medical services in all but two of their health clinics. Access to new technology is never evenly distributed. And even those like iZettle’s de Geer, who are enabling and profiting from a digital payments revolution, have reservations about abandoning paper money outright: “Everyone thinks I’d like to see the death of cash, but privacy is a big issue for all of us. Cash’s benefit is privacy. There’s plenty that’s legal to buy out there that you don’t want everyone to know you’ve bought. ” If America is headed down Sweden’s cashless path, we have much to learn from our Scandinavian friends. Or get comfortable finding stacks of twenties in the fridge next time you’re at grandma’s place. As I pushed through the door of Calm Body Modification, a bell tinkled amiably, as if to reaffirm the shop’s namesake. I looked up at the proprietors, tall men with all their exposed skin covered in tattoos. Above one, a sign advertised genital piercings for 1, 000 kronor. My piercer, Chai, and I retired to the backroom where my skewering would take place. “So now I’m going to tell you something you probably didn’t consider before,” he said, furrowing his brow. “People  —   very conservative   Christian types  —   might come after you for this. They see it as the Mark of the Beast. I just want you to be prepared. ” I nodded like this is something I had expected to hear. This comes from the Book of Revelation: “And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond to receive a mark on their right hand, or on their foreheads and that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast or the number of his name. ” The passage essentially describes a closed economic system, where power is consolidated and financial gatekeepers can shut anyone out. It made for a potent metaphor. I’d spent the last three weeks in search of a connected, seamless future, but I found myself more separated than ever from the people around me. Around week two, I’d noticed how robotic my interactions had become during any financial transaction: walk into some reliable   establishment, mumble order, flash phone, move down the line. Moments like my conversation at the coffee shop with Michael, the barista, heightened these concerns. The    world of commerce is in the midst of a rewiring  —   one that’s supposed to bring in more merchants and give consumers more access to what they want when they want it. But that means new behaviors, some of which are likely to be harmful. New commerce apps and technology may have a lower barrier to entry than, say, credit cards, but many of these programs  —   like miles cards  —   reward you and work best when you’ve got money to spend. And while much of fintech is billed as liberating us from the old ways and institutions, new gatekeepers are bound to emerge, in many respects, guiding us  —   perhaps unwittingly, at times  —   toward the outcomes that their data analysis has told them we want. Bitcoin evangelists are optimistic, but the legacy banking system is as inescapable as it is flawed. Even today’s most disruptive money solutions are still reliant on traditional institutions. While Kenya’s   allows money to be transferred from phone to phone outside of banks using the cellular company Vodafone’s network, at the end of the day, the transferred money is still backed by the pooled accounts held in regulated commercial banks. Bitcoin or   currencies could free us from the tyranny of service fees and interest rates and all the regulations that complicate and ultimately exclude merchants and large populations from the global economy. Or bitcoin could be adopted by legacy institutions that will strip the technology of its open platforms and use it to create a slick, more efficient model of the current system. The fumes from Chai’s alcohol swab jolted me back into the moment. “OK, just a slight pinch, here,” he said. “Sometimes it helps to look away. ” Being chipped was oddly anticlimactic. A trip to the doctor revealed that I hadn’t done anything too horrible to myself. “Wait, you’re telling me I can unlock doors with that thing?” my physician cheerily inquired when I asked if I should be worried about my body rejecting the chip. “I might have to get one myself!” Over the course of a few weeks, the whole thing became an afterthought a piece of me that stored information, like a   flash drive that I couldn’t misplace. But there was still the problem of payments. I reached out to former Venmo employee and   Iqram   who then enlisted the help of Nuseir Yassin, another former Venmo employee, to help me become the first person to pay for a meal with his hand. I asked   who’d had a hand in building one of the most successful    money transferring apps, to explain the allure of the payments industry. “One side effect of this industry is that you make a lot of money if you move a lot of money,” he said. “If you’re serving an underbanked community with a financial product, you get a couple hundred thousand users and you make a small return on each one of them  —   well, that’s a really good business, right there. ” “It’s a big pie,” eMarketer’s Yeager said of the money to be made in the payments space. “It’s going to be around $100 billion by the end of this year, and that’s just retail mobile commerce. ” Similarly, Jeremy Allaire, who runs Circle, cited a study by the Aite research group suggesting that personal payments in the U. S. is a $1. 2 trillion market, 90% of which is cash and checks. “What if you can help introduce a new behavior?” he said of the opportunity to capture some of that money. As Alex Rampell, a general partner and fintech investor at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, told me, the genius of Apple Pay isn’t in the “tap to pay in the physical world” at Whole Foods but the ability to store payment credentials and personal information for millions of cardholders and create a   fingerprint payment method across the entire web. If successful, Apple will have cemented itself as the most widely used and reliable online payment passport, allowing consumers to stop paying premiums at online retail giants like Amazon for the simple convenience of   payments. And then, Rampell suspects, Apple will make the digital wallet available to developers. “If Apple and Google are smart about this, they’ll encourage opening the wallet up as the next platform,” he said. “Imagine allowing budgeting apps like Mint to operate on top of the wallet so that they help you budget your finances in real time. Or allowing lending companies to build a plugin to the Apple Wallet so every person who uses Apple Pay saves 50% on their interest rates? That could force a company like Capital One into bankruptcy by no fault of its own. And that’s a big, big deal. ” All that potential is intoxicating. Over the course of my month, I found myself unexpectedly buying into the possibilities of bitcoin, seduced by the ease of   payment. It feels good to be hopeful about these things, to imagine that there’s a way beyond crazy fees you never asked for  —   a way to replicate the safety, trust, and stability of banks without their consolidation of power and bureaucracy. But disrupting at software speeds in the physical world means feeling growing pains  —   usually important,      signals  —   without having time to consider and interpret them. It turns progressive early adopters like those in Sweden into a system that can exclude its elderly and consolidate power in a handful of banks, all in the name of some kind of progress. The future of money is coming  —   there’s no stopping it. But there is a matter of control, of receiving the future incrementally and responsibly. Weeks passed and normal life returned, save for the   microchip in my left hand. It had become a life raft for the experiment, which had largely failed to yield the kinds of aha moments I had assumed I’d be having when I locked away my wallet. And despite the hype and the influx of money and the feeling that everything is just about to change, it’s going to take real time. (It’s very much worth noting that just in the week before this story was published, the fintech    lending darling Lending Club’s CEO resigned over an internal probe concerning improper loan sales a security breach in a Hong Kong cryptocurrency exchange resulted in the loss of at least $2. 14 million and the massive   consortium MCX has significantly delayed  —   perhaps killed  —   the rollout of its digital wallet, CurrentC, to “concentrate more heavily” on other    areas of the financial sector.) That’s because today’s fintech is more evolutionary than it is revolutionary. And when this change does happen, it will do so on the backs of a new generation that isn’t just asking for a new money model but is demanding it. Buying a sandwich with my fist isn’t some paradigm shift  —   it’s a   for something weightier: a future that feels just a bit less recognizable. One April morning, my inbox pinged. I’d given Yassin full access to my Venmo account, after which he set up a server linked to my unique Venmo payment key. Now his code was working in test runs. We picked a restaurant  —   a Sri Lankan place on New York’s Lower East Side that’s partly owned by   and of course accepts Venmo  —   and Yassin coded the chip so that it would launch a website on the merchant’s device when scanned. The site would trigger a payment from my Venmo account with an automatic 20% tip. All I’d need was my hand. We got to the restaurant a bit after noon on a cold, rainy Monday. Absentmindedly forking spicy lamb into my mouth, I was sure we’d be derailed by a glitch or a bug. Word of the impending hand payment spread in the cramped restaurant. Our waiter, a friendly guy in a   Yankees cap and a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles   was excited but announced his skepticism. “This is crazy, dude,” he said, half excitedly, half exasperatedly. When the bill came, I ambled up to the counter of the cramped restaurant as the other diners craned their necks. Our waiter held out the phone as I thrust my clammy fist forward. Nothing registered. My stomach dropped. He waved the phone like a metal detector around the whole of my fist. Finally, a beep. We locked eyes, pupils dilated. Numbers were input. Another beep. Then, the ching of a cash register. The sweetest sound. •": "108101",

A weekend of nonlethal terrorism; the ceasefire in Syria is kaput; Chris Christie knew about Bridgegate.     3 attacks. Zero civilian deaths. Good work, USA.             On Monday, police apprehended Ahmad Khan Rahami, who is suspected of setting bombs that went off in New Jersey and New York on Saturday. [NYT] No one was killed in either attack (though 29 people were injured in the New York bombing). Rahami was born in Afghanistan and immigrated to the US with his family when he was 7. He spent some time in Pakistan (and possibly Afghanistan) several years ago. [The Daily Beast   Shane Harris, Nancy A. Youssef, and Katie Zavadski] To date, no terrorist organization has taken credit for Rahami’s attacks (possibly because he is still alive). By contrast, a mass stabbing attack at a mall in Minnesota on Saturday night (which injured nine) was claimed by an Islamic State —  linked news agency after the attacker was killed by police. [NYT   Mitch Smith] The stabber has been identified as Dahir A. Adan, a Somali American  —   an immigrant community that’s struggled with the radicalization of a few of its young men. [AP] But the fact that neither Adan nor Rahami succeeded in killing anyone points out an important truth about terrorism: A radicalized amateur, without training in terrorism, doesn’t make a very good terrorist. [Vox   Jennifer Williams] That didn’t stop certain media outlets from treating the bombing in New York, in particular, as a threat every bit as serious as if it had killed dozens of people. [Politico   Jack Shafer] Nor did it stop the emergency alert that all New Yorkers got on their smartphones this morning, warning them to be on the lookout for Rahami  —   but not giving them a picture or description (and therefore encouraging racial profiling). [NY Mag   Brian Feldman] New Yorkers themselves, though, are pretty tough.

That did not go well             The   ceasefire in Syria officially expired Monday. There’s no sign it’s going to be reanimated. It’s pretty much dead. [ABC News   Elizabeth McLaughlin] The coup de grace arguably was the fault of the US  —   it launched an airstrike Saturday that was intended to hit ISIS but killed 60 Syrian soldiers instead. [NYT   David E. Sanger, Mark Mazzetti, and Ben Hubbard] Syria has formally declared the ceasefire over, and has resumed bombing of   areas. [FT   Erika Solomon] Technically, though, you might remember that Syria was never officially a party to the ceasefire to begin with. It was an agreement between the US and Russia. But Russia is extremely upset about the US’s botched airstrike, making it unlikely that the two will agree to a renewal. [Washington Post   Liz Sly, Karen DeYoung, and Louisa Loveluck] Arguably, the ceasefire never succeeded to begin with. Castello Road  —   a route to Aleppo known as the ”road of death”  —   never got secure enough to bring needed supplies to civilians living under siege in Aleppo, even during the ceasefire. [Vox   Yochi Dreazen and Javier Zarracina] But the ceasefire didn’t need to succeed as ceasefire to be a political success. Research on ceasefires suggests they can build the political space for resolutions, whether or not they stop violence on their own. [NYT   Max Fisher]   Time for some traffic problems for Chris Christie             Federal prosecutors declared on Monday that they have evidence Chris Christie knew about the closures of traffic lanes in Fort Lee, New Jersey  —   a political scandal known as ”Bridgegate.” [Reuters   Karen Freifeld and Joseph Ax] The revelation came during opening arguments in the trial of two Christie aides accused of orchestrating the closures as political retribution for the mayor of Fort Lee not endorsing Christie for reelection. [NJ. com   Ted Sherman and Matt Arco] No one’s claiming that Christie ordered or even approved the payback maneuver. Allegedly, he heard about them on the third day. But it’s still bad news for what remains of his political prospects (attorney general to President Trump, perhaps? ).[The Atlantic   Nora Kelly] Of course, he’s still running Trump’s presidential transition team. And the new revelation probably won’t change that: Back when Trump was running against Christie for the GOP nomination, he made clear that he suspected Christie had known about the ”traffic problems” the whole time. [Vox   Andrew Prokop] The transition team is no small role! It gives Christie an outsize role in choosing political appointees. And since Christie appears to prefer the sort of people who text, in earnest, ”Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,” that might say bad things about the character of likely Trump administration appointees.

    "Jurors convicted a man of murdering Florida State University’s   mascot, who was  killed during a squabble over which spices to use in a gumbo recipe.

    "BERLIN  —   Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party suffered the latest in a string of defeats in German state elections on Sunday, when her Christian Democratic Union was ousted from power in Berlin after its worst showing in the capital since World War II, according to preliminary results. Voters in Berlin turned out in higher numbers than in previous years, many responding to voter mobilization calls from the   Alternative for Germany party. The party is now poised to enter the  ’s legislature for the first time, although its share of the vote, 14. 2 percent in the preliminary results, was less than what it was two weeks ago in Ms. Merkel’s home state,   where it placed second. Ms. Merkel’s party won 17. 6 percent of the vote in Berlin, not enough to allow it to continue as the junior partner in a governing coalition with the Social Democrats. The   Social Democratic Party earned 21. 6 percent of the vote and is expected to form a government with two other parties: the Left Party, with 15. 6 percent, and the Greens, with 15. 2. “We are all angry that the AfD got in,” Michael Müller, Berlin’s mayor and the Social Democrats’ leading candidate, told cheering supporters in the capital, referring to the Alternative for Germany party. “But I can assure you that Berlin will remain an international city, open to the world. ” The result proved that the Alternative for Germany party is not as popular in Berlin as it is elsewhere, but it managed to draw considerable support, mostly from the city’s eastern districts. It campaigned hard against the chancellor’s decision last year to allow more than one million migrants into the country. Berlin is the 10th state in which the party has earned representation, and with little more than a year to go before the 2017 general election, the party appears to be gaining enough strength to earn seats in the national Parliament. Some commentators viewed the result as a chance for a rebirth of Germany’s struggling traditional parties and its overall democracy. “The success of the Alternative for Germany is a   call that it can’t be taken for granted that society is liberal and will remain so,” Heribert Prantl, a journalist at the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, wrote in a commentary. “Nor can it be taken for granted that minorities (and not only the refugees) are and will be respected. ” Many former supporters of the chancellor’s party drifted to the liberal Free Democratic Party, which voters returned to the state legislature with about 6 percent of the vote after it was ousted in the 2011 election. But the upstart Pirate Party, which won seats in the state Parliament in 2011, was voted out. Ms. Merkel, who governs on the national level in a coalition with the Social Democrats, had blamed Mr. Müller, the   mayor, for refusing to be held accountable for the chaotic circumstances faced by the 79, 000 refugees who arrived last year in the capital. “Based on my own experience, I know that leaders of government are always responsible, and they will be made responsible,” the chancellor said in an interview with the Berlin newspaper Tagesspiegel before the vote. Yet many in Ms. Merkel’s own conservative bloc have criticized her for allowing the refugee influx to become a crisis. Horst Seehofer, the leader of a Bavarian sister party to Ms. Merkel’s conservatives, has been among her loudest critics. In an interview released Friday, Mr. Seehofer threatened to withhold his party’s support for her in the 2017 election unless she agreed to set a limit on the number of new refugees to be admitted. Frank Henkel, the leading candidate for Ms. Merkel’s party in Berlin, blamed squabbling for the party’s poor showing in Berlin, saying the infighting had alienated voters and led them to question the bloc’s ability to govern.": "24036",
    "This week the podcast and show Invisibilia examines the nature of reality, with a Silicon Valley techie who created apps to randomize his life a wildlife biologist who thinks bears aren’t dangerous and a psychologist who trains herself to experience the world like dogs do. Noses are the unsung feature of the face, sunscreened or surgically fixed, but rarely exalted. And the sense they enable, smelling, is likewise uncelebrated. Regularly voted the ”sense I’d be most willing to lose” olfaction is largely ignored  —   unless it brings word of something savory or foul nearby. But we are born smellers. After being enveloped while in the womb in the smell of our mother and the foods she ingested, babies emerge macrosmatic,  . They find the mother’s nipple and recognize their parents by scent. Children can identify their siblings and friends by smell. In those earliest sniffings, smelling is all about discovery and navigation. Gradually, though, we forsake our noses. What have you smelled today? Perhaps a   odors, mostly likely food or manufactured fragrance, or maybe one. Or none. Over the same period, your dog has sniffed his way out of sleep, come to examine your smell in the morning, busily investigated the smell leavings from the night before on your walk outside, and may have found his way to his fellow canines by scent. We admire the dog’s olfactory acuity, and we should: dogs have hundreds of millions more olfactory receptors, the cells at the back of the nose that grab odors out of the air, than we do. They have two dedicated, separate routes in their snouts for sniffing and breathing they have elaborate bones in their nose that hold yet more olfactory tissue they even exhale out the side slits of their nostrils in order not to disturb the odors coming in. And as the performance of dogs that do tracking,    and other detection tasks, they can use their highly sensitive olfactory instruments to locate substances that we never even thought had an odor: cancerous cells minute quantities of TNT the   footprint left by a missing person. All is not lost for us humans, though. We have the equipment, and, while not as varied or extensive as the dogs’ it works perfectly well. Last month John McGann, an Associate Professor at Rutgers, published a review in Science last month reminding us that humans do, after all, have an olfactory bulb, and Swedish professor Matthias Laska has extensively demonstrated that in detecting some odors, such as amyl acetate (which smells like banana) we are plenty sensitive. Our experience of the flavor of food is mostly due to smell, experienced through the back of the mouth  —   retronasal olfaction  —   instead of through the nostrils. Knowing all this, I recently embarked on a project culminating in my book Being a Dog: Following the Dog into a World of Smell, in which I tried to improve my sense of smell by following the dog’s lead, as well as that of some olfactory experts, among them a perfumer, a sommelier, and a pair of animal trackers. Dogs excepted, few of these experts were born noses. I learned that a few simple steps can change your nose from neglected to noticed, as it had for them: Stick your nose in it. Consider a dog’s daily behavior, and contrast it with the frequency with which you see a person with nose smashed against a surface, inhaling calmly and confidently. Simply getting closer to a source and bravely sniffing will bring more odor molecules into our noses. Get over it. In the U. S. at least, our culture is a discourager of smells. The baby who notices an interesting smell? Her parents ignore her. Eventually, she will think of smells in a mostly binary way, as lovely or horrible. By contrast, experts in smelling view odors merely as information, not intrinsically good or bad, just as the images that we see tell us about our world. Treat scents like sights and it becomes easier to smell. Name the source. Once you start bringing your attention to what you smell, you may be at a loss for words: English doesn’t have much of a vocabulary for smells. So olfactory experts create their own jargon. You can adopt theirs, but consider, too, our smell memories: The scent of cedar mixed with tobacco that floods me with memories of my father’s desk a whiff of pencil shavings, zipping me back to learning cursive in my third grade classroom. Find your own language, images or memories to represent the smell, and in so doing it will be easier to invoke the next time you sniff it. Even after spending months learning how to smell like a dog, observing detection dog training, following truffle dogs, and accompanying my own dog train in the sport of ”nose work” I feel certain: I don’t experience the world my dog does. But my own world is changed: It smells. And by smelling intentionally instead of just letting smells happen to me, odors have lost their simplicity. I’m glad to smell my family and friends. I know the smell of the afternoon in my office, warmed by sun, as well as the smell of the advent of spring. Before opening my eyes on awakening this morning, I could smell that the dogs and cat had joined me in bed, but my husband was up. In the next hour, I smelled mown grass and a waft of cloves in the park the mustiness of a raincoat taken out of a back closet when the toast was ready and the beautiful,   smell of the top of my son’s head. I relish it all. Alexandra Horowitz is head of the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College and author of the recent book Being a Dog: Following the Dog into a World of Smell.": "165419",

    "Washington (CNN) America’s longest war just got a little longer for thousands of U. S. troops. President Barack Obama’s decision to keep 9, 800 soldiers in Afghanistan through this year    double what was previously planned    represents an American bet that a new president, Ashraf Ghani, might finally be the reliable partner in Kabul who can solidify gains, such as they are, of the   U. S. mission. But though Obama has long pined for a dependable counterpart in Afghanistan and hoped for greater stability there, Ghani’s arrival comes with a significant political price. In order to bolster Ghani, who emerged as the winner after a U. S.  settlement to a disputed Afghan election last year, Obama has had little choice but to accept his appeals for more U. S. troops to stay longer in Afghanistan. READ: Obama halts Afghanistan troop withdrawal, And Tuesday’s concession on slowing troop withdrawals sets up an even greater dilemma for Obama, who sees his historic role as concluding the expansive land wars he inherited in Afghanistan and Iraq. It also carries the risk of another misplaced gamble on another leader in the Middle East or South Asia who doesn’t, or can’t, deliver the friendly, solid leadership the U. S. desires. So far, Obama and Ghani have been making a show of camaraderie. Ghani is basking in an effusive reception during a visit to Washington this week, a sharp contrast to the antagonism and treading on eggshells that characterized Obama’s poisoned dealings with   Hamid Karzai. And over and over, he is expressing deep gratitude for the sacrifices made by the United States to keep the Taliban at bay in Afghanistan,  It is clear from the lavish welcome offered to Ghani    a trip to Camp David, five hours in the White House and an address to Congress    that the administration sees him as everything Karzai was not. Where Karzai was erratic, Ghani seems calm. Ghani favors a sharp Western business suit rather than the exotic flowing green robe that Karzai made famous. Where Karzai raged at civilian casualties in U. S. operations, Ghani is expressing deep and repeated gratitude for the price paid by the United States to keep the Taliban at bay in Afghanistan. ”The people of Afghanistan recognize the bravery of your soldiers and the tremendous sacrifices that Americans have made to keep Afghanistan free,” Ghani told a joint session of Congress on Wednesday to applause from the chamber. ”We owe a profound debt to the 2, 350 servicemen and women killed and the more than 20, 000 who have been wounded in (the) service of your country and ours,” he said. ”Thank you for staying.” Ghani’s comments are part of a clear strategy to secure   U. S. support for Afghanistan’s armed forces    which now have primary responsibility for combat. He not only personally offered Obama praise but painstakingly singled out the long list of generals who have run the Afghan war, ambassadors appointed by Republican and Democratic administrations, and politically powerful lawmakers in both parties. In the short term, Ghani’s visit does represent a tangible success for an administration that has struggled to rack up foreign policy wins, and a desire to cement Ghani in power will be one of Obama’s goals.  But later this year, or early next, Obama must decide whether to honor his vow to get every American    save for a small detachment at the U. S. embassy    home from Afghanistan or to pass on an enduring war to a third U. S. president when he leaves office in January 2017. ”I think right now his intention is to stick to it. That’s what he would like to do, and we know that is the legacy he would like to leave    as the president who ended two wars,” said Scott Smith, a former senior United Nations official in Afghanistan now with the US Institute of Peace. ”But I think there is a very strong bipartisan consensus in Washington and on the Hill that it may be worth reconsidering this decision.” Obama insisted at Tuesday’s press conference with Ghani that the 2016 date for a full withdrawal was not negotiable. ”This flexibility reflects our reinvigorated partnership with Afghanistan, which is aimed at making Afghanistan secure and preventing it from being used to launch terrorist attacks,” Obama said. OPINION: Why U. S. troops need to stay in Afghanistan beyond 2016, But the president added: ”This specific trajectory of the 2016 drawdown will be established later this year to enable our final consolidation to a   embassy presence by the end of 2016.” Holding off on that decision makes sense for Obama, simply because of the elevated political stakes. But he will soon face familiar charges from Republican opponents that he is once again making strategic military decisions for political reasons, not based on battlefield conditions. And he will have to weigh whether a full departure of U. S. troops would weaken the fledgling Afghan forces, diminish American leverage with the Ghani government and offer an opening to the Taliban and other extremist groups. A key driver of his decision could be whether Ghani turns out to justify the hopes that are being placed in him and whether his current truce with his election foe, former foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah, holds. Ghani inspires confidence abroad, partly because he speaks the twin languages of the Western elite  —   English and Commerce. An ethnic Pashtun, he’s an academic, who was educated at Columbia University, worked for the World Bank and is a former finance minister won approval among outsiders for his economic reforms. He also lacks the past links to warlordism and violence of many others who came to prominence during Afghanistan’s war torn modern history. ”Every indication so far is that President Ghani wants to work closely with the U. S. and shares a lot of U. S. concerns on issues like corruption and so on,” said Nora Bensahel, a defense specialist at American University. Importantly, Ghani is also sending a message to his own domestic constituency that he wants American troops to stay    a step that was not taken by former Iraqi prime minister Nuri   another   leader in whom the U. S. placed disproportionate hopes, ultimately souring the relationship and  solidifying Obama’s intent to fully withdraw from that country. And there are no guarantees that Ghani, over the   will continue to enjoy the honeymoon that he experienced in the White House on Tuesday    especially as political conditions in Afghanistan remain dangerous. ”There’s not going to be a meltdown in   relations, but there could be a meltdown in   relations or some other catastrophic event in Afghanistan that could change the whole picture,” said Michael O’Hanlon of the Brookings Institution. ”Ghani is not going to be able to be a miracle worker and fix all of Afghanistan’s problems.” The U. S. has been stymied by the depths of the rugged country’s problems and complicated politics before. And there is a cautionary tale of a White House wagering too much on a promising Afghan leader. More than a decade ago, another urbane, bearded and smiling Afghan leader came to Washington, stood in the White House and Congress, and told Americans, still traumatized by the September 11 attacks in 2001, what they wanted to hear. That man’s name was Hamid Karzai. ”Ten years ago, a Karzai visit to Washington would have been greeted with the same kind of welcome and excitement and positivity that this first visit from President Ghani has,” said Smith. But as the war dragged on, Karzai became embittered that the United States went to war in Iraq and seemed to turn away from Afghanistan. When Obama came to power, the White House adopted a   approach with Karzai despite sending a surge of U. S. troops to try and finish off the Afghan war. Soon allegations of corruption around Karzai found their way into the U. S. press and the Afghan leader’s relations with Washington went badly astray. Still, for now the untested Ghani may represent Obama’s best hope of getting out of Afghanistan without another blemish on a legacy aimed at ending wars    one that has already been tarnished by his decision to send troops back to Iraq to fight ISIS. ”I do think the president has a very real choice to make. I don’t think he is being forced into this by any pressure Ghani has put on him,” Bensahel said. ”He has a lot politically at stake.”": "61825",

    "Entitlement reform might be back in fashion. The House Agriculture Committee just released a lengthy report on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) formerly known as Food Stamps. The report  —   Past, Present,  Future of SNAP  —   is a comprehensive review of the federal government’s costliest food program, which has a projected budget of $82 billion in 2017. Republicans in Congress have been eyeing changes to SNAP, and President Trump may have the chance to sign the first major reforms to this program since 1996. The report is a good balance of accountability and compassion, no doubt gearing up for the usual “you want poor people to starve” resistance from Democrats. Opponents are already lined up not just to challenge any changes but to push for more benefits. James Weill, president of the Food Research and Action Center, an   lobbying group, testified that “benefits are not adequate to get most families through the whole month . . . even though SNAP recipients use a variety of savvy shopping practices to stretch their limited food dollars, such as clipping coupons, using shopping lists, purchasing generic brands, buying in bulk quantities, and shopping at multiple stores” (just like most people). During testimony to the committee last year, Erik Randolph of the Illinois Policy Institute broke down some of the numbers: A single parent in Lake County [Illinois] who earns $12 per hour brings home just over $22, 000 in net pay. However, that same single parent is eligible for an array of welfare benefits [including tax credits, subsidized school lunch for their children, housing assistance and child care services]. When you add up the value of those potential benefits, it comes to an astounding $39, 534, bringing the total net receivables  —   in terms of earned income and benefits  —   to $61, 655. In comparison, suppose you earn $18 per hour, bringing home about $33, 000 in net pay. That is a gain of about $11, 000 in earned income. However, your potential welfare benefits will drop drastically to $5, 236 from $39, 534, for a loss of more than $34, 000. Why would any sane person voluntarily give up $34, 000 in benefits to gain only $11, 000? This could help explain the near      rate, which fell to 62. 7 percent in September. A morass of federal and state agencies that oversee 18 different   programs leads to overlap and waste, another problem the next Congress could tackle. Although SNAP is federally funded, it’s administered at the state level with little coordination between it and other   offices, which sows fertile ground for fraud and misuse. Dave Yost, Ohio’s state auditor, told the committee on October 31 that “  fraud hardens the hearts of good people and deafens their ears to the sound of hunger. For those who hunger, and for those who pay the bill, we owe a greater effort toward integrity. ” While most SNAP beneficiaries are children (68 percent) about 11 percent of recipients are     Adults Without Dependents (ABAWDs) accounting for nearly $10 billion per year in benefits. Some states still have time limit waivers for ABAWDs  —   allowing benefits for longer than the standard three months  —   issued after the recession. Congress will likely push to tighten time limits and for tougher work requirements, which Dr. Ron Haskins of the Brookings Institution says are “modest . . . and do not appear to be rigorously enforced. ” The biggest fight could be over eliminating certain items from eligibility. Taxpayers now subsidize the purchase of lots of food they probably shouldn’t. According to a recent Department of Agriculture survey, soft drinks rank number one on the list of most purchased items with SNAP benefits, to the tune of nearly $360 million per year. Other items that could be on the chopping block include bag snacks (#4 on the list) candy (#11) and ice cream (#15). You can just hear the Democrats now: “Republicans want to take away popsicles from poor kids!” Food companies won’t like those plans, either. But it’s worth a look. Not only did the number of SNAP recipients increase over the past eight years, so did Americans’ collective waistline. In 2009, eight states reported at least 30 percent of their adults were obese in 2015, 27 states did with even higher rates among minorities and the poor. The report also addresses how to improve food access, reduce “food deserts,” and promote healthier food. Democrats will use any proposed changes to portray Republicans as heartless  . But with food prices at an   low, rising obesity and diabetes rates, and no major overhaul in a generation, SNAP reform should be on the table.,": "121985",
    "The   debate has returned to the forefront of the Republican presidential battle as the candidates charge into Saturday’s South Carolina primary, going to great lengths to prove their steadfast support of the Second Amendment. Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are locked in a nasty fight over the issue, as Cruz effectively argues the billionaire businessman would, if elected, abolish gun rights. “If Donald Trump becomes president, the Second Amendment will be written out of the Constitution, because it is abundantly clear that Donald Trump is not a conservative,” Cruz told ABC News on Sunday, the morning after a GOP debate in Greenville. Trump claims Cruz is blatantly misrepresenting his positions and has demanded Cruz retract his statements. “Cruz does lie,” Trump said Wednesday at a South Carolina rally, after earlier declaring, “I’m the strongest person on the stage for the Second Amendment. ” He also said Wednesday that he and his sons are “proud” National Rifle Association members. Jeb Bush, meanwhile, drew considerable attention this week for tweeting a picture of a personalized gun with his name etched into it. Next to the photo was a single word: “America. ” America. pic. twitter.  While he faced Twitter ridicule for it, Bush defended the tweet on Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom,” explaining that the gun was given to him by a manufacturer during a visit.  “It was to say that I’m for the Second Amendment,” Bush said, touting his NRA rating. “It meant nothing more than that. It was an appreciation for receiving a gun at a manufacturer that makes the gun, and a lot of jobs are created because of that. ” It’s no accident that gun rights are surging back as a debate topic in the GOP race. Roughly 44 percent of South Carolina residents own guns, according to a study published in June 2015 in the journal Injury Prevention. The state allows residents and   to carry a concealed firearm, with some exceptions. The state’s eastern seaboard is populated largely by military and retired military, while gun rights are also a big part of the culture in the state’s rural communities  —   and beyond. Even in the tourist hub of Charleston, the indoor shooting range Quickshot is a popular entertainment spot where customers can select a gun and shoot at paper targets, like renting a ball and shoes at a bowling alley. The range offers specials for couples on a date and attracted a steady crowd this past Valentine’s Day weekend. While the GOP 2016 candidates are sparring over gun rights, the debate is likely to heat up more when the eventual Republican nominee engages with either Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders in the general election. Those in the GOP field who have served in public office    Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush    all have a high rating from the NRA. Trump and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson are   candidates, and have no NRA rating. Cruz’s campaign, in challenging Trump’s record, has tried to tie Trump to former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, one of the most vocal gun control advocates in the country. But the Trump campaign has pushed back. Still, the GOP candidates are mindful of striking the right tone on guns, at least in South Carolina. They must stay in good standing with the powerful gun lobby while being sensitive to the fact that, last year, a white police officer fatally shot an unarmed black man in North Charleston and a gunman killed nine black parishioners inside a downtown Charleston church. South Carolina residents and political leaders from across the political spectrum appear to have found some common ground on the related issues of police body cameras, better   care and improving FBI background checks. The alleged shooter in the church massacre, Dylann Roof, was allowed to purchase the handgun despite having previously admitted to a felony   charge. Joe Desilet, a partner at the D. C.  political consulting firm 21st  Main, doesn’t see the GOP candidates easing on their defense of the Second Amendment as a result of the Charleston shootings. “However, as Sen. Marco Rubio and others have already done, you may see the candidates advocate for   reform and other   reforms alongside their defense of the amendment,” he said. James Overby, a district director with   Gun Owners of South Carolina, downplayed the notion that Trump would, if elected, try to weaken Second Amendment rights, despite him giving money to the political campaigns of   advocates and Democrats Clinton and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. “I don’t believe it,” said Overby, adding the NRA would have already alerted members in South Carolina and elsewhere if that were the case. Clinton and Sanders, by contrast, support tighter gun laws and mandatory body cameras for police officers. State Democratic Sen. Marlon Kimpson, who backs Clinton, said Clinton’s “immediate” call for tougher gun laws in the aftermath of both killings was a deciding factor in him choosing Clinton over Sanders.": "83179",
    "About 190 workers, most of them Muslim immigrants from Somalia, were fired from their jobs at a meat packing and distribution plant in Colorado this week for walking off the job to protest a workplace prayer dispute. [Approximately 200 workers reportedly walked off of their jobs at Cargill Meat Solutions in Fort Morgan earlier this month to protest what they allege were changes made in times allowed for them to take breaks in order to participate in Islamic prayer.  According to the Denver Post, some workers later returned and were able to keep their jobs, but the majority stayed away in hopes of swaying management to reinstate a prayer schedule as representatives of the Council on   Relations (CAIR) —  an “unindicted  ” in the Holy Land Foundation trial, which concerned fundraising for the Palestinian terror organization Hamas —  negotiated on their behalf. CAIR is also helping the aunt of a    child left orphaned by radical jihadist couple who massacred 14 people and wounded 22 others in a terrorist attack in San Bernardino this month gain custody of the infant. “They feel missing their prayer is worse than losing their job,” Jaylani Hussein, a spokesman and executive director of CAIR said. “It’s like losing a blessing from God. ” Salat is the obligatory Muslim prayer and the second Pillar of Islam, which is required to be performed five times a day by observant Muslims. Hussein reportedly said that the Muslims workers CAIR was negotiating on behalf of would pray at the plant multiple times a day in    minute blocks of time and alleged that the plant decided to change the practice. The Post notes that the time was carved out of a   break period or from the workers’ unpaid   lunch breaks. “At no time did Cargill prevent people from prayer at Fort Morgan,” director of communications for Cargill, Mike Martin reportedly said. “Nor have we changed policies related to religious accommodation and attendance. This has been mischaracterized. ” He added that accommodation on a daily basis is dependent upon changing factors in the plant, noting that this facet had been “clearly communicated to all employees. ” Martin also said that employees of all faiths are permitted to use a “reflection room” at the plant which observant Muslims also use to pray but noted the company’s policy that a maximum of two people are permitted to use the area at any given time in order to avoid slowing down production on the assembly line. Over 2, 000 people work at the plant. Cargill has a policy that prevents workers who are terminated from reapplying for a job there for 6 months.

    "U. S. President Donald Trump’s push to force U. S. industry to bring jobs home is opening investment avenues for Chinese companies in Mexico, an executive with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) the country’s largest lender, said on Friday. Fears of a hit to foreign investment ran high when Ford Motor Co ( ) canceled a $1. 6 billion plant in Mexico’s central state of San Luis Potosi in January.  Trump, who had railed against U. S. manufacturers investing in Mexico, hailed the decision as a major victory, but Ford put it down to declining demand for small cars. Yaogang Chen, head of ICBC’s ( )( ) Mexico unit, said U. S. industry’s loss could be China’s gain. ”If some U. S. investment projects don’t (happen) there has to be somebody to invest. . .. If Chinese companies think it is profitable, they will invest,” he said in an interview on the sidelines of a banking conference in the resort of Acapulco. In February, China’s Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group Co Ltd (JAC Motor) ( ) and Mexico’s Giant Motors, along with distributor Chori Co Ltd ( ) said they would invest over $210 million in an existing plant to build SUVs in the central state of Hidalgo. Prior to Trump’s campaign against U. S. manufacturers shipping jobs overseas, Chinese companies were making tentative inroads into Mexico. China’s BAIC Motor Corp Ltd ( ) in June 2016 started selling in Mexico its own cars imported from China and has said that it will look into building an industrial plant in Mexico to produce cars and electric vehicles. BAIC is already a client of ICBC’s in Mexico. ICBC, one of the world’s top banks by market capitalization and assets, received its banking license in Mexico in 2014 and started operations there in  . ”JAC, we think, will be a client of ours in Mexico too,” Chen said. Still, Chinese foreign direct investment in Mexico is a tiny fraction of what U. S. firms have plowed in over the years.   ICBC expects to grow its assets and loan portfolio in Mexico tenfold over the next three years to some 10 billion pesos ($533 million) Chen said. The executive said ICBC aims to offer a service to allow clients to convert Mexican pesos to Chinese renminbi and vice versa, and make   transactions cheaper.

    "One of the more effective, albeit disingenuous, narratives of the American left goes something like this: The business community is evil and must be punished for the sins it has committed or may yet commit. Its popularity on the left is growing, egged on by President Obama, presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and radical Sen. Elizabeth Warren  —   even at times by Democratic   Hillary Clinton. But they weren’t the ones who mainstreamed it. No, I’m afraid the modern equivalent of this demagoguery comes from a darker, more ambitious and more volatile place: the mind of Eliot Spitzer. Yes, the former New York governor and state attorney general  —   when he was known as the “Sheriff of Wall Street”  —   has been in the news a lot the last couple of days after   25, at the Plaza Hotel over the weekend. Spitzer denied the choking incident, and Travis has  . Whatever you make of this episode (the woman is less than half his age with an apparently spotty employment record) it’s fair to say it isn’t Spitzer’s lone lapse of judgment. Aside from his crazy behavior as governor (remember how he was accused of using state police to spy on a political opponent?) who can forget the reason he was ultimately forced out of office: a federal sting operation that caught him having sex with a hooker in Washington, DC. This rendezvous, as I pointed out in this paper back in 2013, was paid for in part by New York’s taxpayers because the   muscled his way into a congressional subcommittee meeting and used state resources to cover his travel expenses. (Spitzer paid for the hooker himself.) But these are mere symptoms of Spitzer’s larger disorder: recklessness that manifests itself not just in his personal life, but in his professional one as well, where he continually pursued political prosecutions against all reasonable evidence. This is something voters should consider whenever they hear Warren or Sanders parrot their   bile on the campaign trail, or when another ambitious prosecutor looks to make his political bones on the backs of the business community with nebulous evidence. Or if Spitzer, as he did just a couple of years ago, attempts to return to public life. Of course, Spitzer didn’t invent the idea of using Wall Street prosecutions as a springboard to higher office. Indeed, the great Mayor Rudy Giuliani used that playbook as US attorney and we were lucky to have him. But Spitzer did reach new heights in his   and new lows in basing many of his prosecutions as attorney general on nebulous evidence that resulted in failed cases  —   something that has become a benchmark for the left ever since. On his watch, there were lots of press conferences and   media adulation as he threw mud at his targets  —   but none of his top   bad guys went to jail. Those who fought back often had success. Maybe the most blatant example came in 2005 when Spitzer accused Hank Greenberg of using shady accounting to gin up profits at the insurer he ran, AIG. Forget for a moment that Greenberg denied the charges and the numbers involved were picayune; the hoopla eventually forced Greenberg to resign and sent the company into management disarray. Spitzer didn’t seem to care. He used the AIG case to propel himself into the governor’s mansion in 2007 while taking to the airwaves to label Greenberg a “fraud” even before filing any charges. Eventually, a far worse financial calamity would hit AIG. The new,   management ramped up so much risk at AIG, the company’s insolvency became one of the triggers for the 2008 financial crisis. And as for the case against Greenberg: It exists as a shell of what Spitzer initially brought, with nearly all the charges having been dropped. The    Greenberg maintains his innocence and has sued Spitzer for libel, for good measure. As far as I’m concerned, the tribulations of Spitzer’s personal life are a mere symptom of a broader dysfunction of reckless,     politicking that, I’m afraid, is here to stay.

    "When I was 13, in 1981, I immigrated to the United States with my parents and sister from Peru. Since that time the D. C. area has been my home. In many ways, I’ve lived a hybrid life based on values, traditions and experiences of two countries, which is nothing unusual for immigrants. But as I’ve gotten older, and the reality that I have lived in Washington for about   of my life has set in, I have become more nostalgic for Peru  —   family, food, friends, traditions. Three years ago I embarked on a   project exploring my roots; in particular, I wanted to document daily life, festivals and traditions in Lake Titicaca, Puno√ where my Italian    immigrated to in the late 1800s, from Italy. Like me, he was an immigrant and a photographer. and He was also a writer, and musician, and completely immersed in the life and culture of his adopted home, never returning to his native land.     By the time I was born, my family had long left Lake Titicaca, but that’s where many of the great stories I heard as a child came from. And as the folklore capital of Peru, it is also central to Peruvian identity. Whereas Puno was a new land that meant a new identity for my    for me it is a land of inherited memories and part of my identity. Like my    I, too, have made my life in a new country.

    "As we close in on the June 12 Tony Awards  —   the excitement mounts!  —   here’s a snapshot of the race: “Hamilton” has a   16 nominations, but it’s not going to topple Mel Brooks’ “The Producers” for the most wins. Mel will remain the King of Broadway with his 12 Tonys. An informal survey of Tony voters reveals a few cracks in the “Hamilton” facade. Cynthia Erivo, the breakout star of “The Color Purple,” is the clear favorite for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Musical, snapping the prize away from Phillipa Soo, of “Hamilton. ” Both are terrific, but   Erivo is one reason why “The Color Purple,” a show dismissed by many voters back in 2005, is on track to win Best Revival of a Musical. Soo was also one of the “Hamilton” cast members who agitated for a share of the profits. There are plenty to go around, of course, but more than a few producers  —   and some writers from the Dramatists Guild  —   are worried about setting a precedent. They’re prepared to fight Actors’ Equity on this front if it comes up in future negotiations. “We will argue that ‘Hamilton’ is unique,” one producer says. “Actors are not entitled to profits. They’re entitled to a paycheck, but we take the risk. ” Leslie Odom Jr. my “Smash”   was another “Hamilton” agitator, so there’s grumbling about him as well. He’s terrific as Aaron Burr, for which he’s nominated for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Musical, and I think he’s on track to be a big movie or TV star. But more than a few voters told me they marked their ballot for Danny Burstein of “Fiddler on the Roof” instead. “He’s earned it,” one producer says. My money’s still on Odom, but if there’s going to be an upset on Tony night, look for it in this category. The Tony for Best Choreography will likely go to Savion Glover for “Shuffle Along. ” Voters like this show, and Glover’s work is one reason why it moves so swiftly. He’s brilliantly   the original musical’s dances while giving them a modern spin. There’s support for “Shuffle” director George C. Wolfe in his category, but probably not enough to upset Thomas Kail, who staged “Hamilton. ” Let me put in a word for John Doyle. I never gave much thought to “The Color Purple,” but his production has made me a huge fan of the show. In fact, I’m waving my hand in the air and singing “Like a blade of   a   a waterfall” as I write this. David Rockwell is quietly gaining traction for Best Scenic Design of a Musical for his exquisite jewel box set for “She Loves Me. ” Voters adore this revival, lovingly directed by Scott Ellis. It won’t topple “The Color Purple,” but voters will give it a nod by recognizing Rockwell. I’m picking up a lot of support in her category for Ann Roth, who designed the witty costumes for “Shuffle Along. ” Everybody loves this salty old broad. (She won’t be offended by that phrase, trust me!) How can you not vote for a woman who breaks out the charcuterie and the vino when you visit her at her costume shop? Plus, she should have won for her brilliantly funny costumes for “The Book of Mormon” in 2011. (“Priscilla, Queen of the Desert” won, if you can believe that.) Now that I’ve thoroughly depressed the “Hamilton” producers with what they won’t win, let me lift their spirits with what they will win. Best Musical is a given, and so is Best Original Score (Music   Lyrics) Written for the Theatre. It pains me to admit this, but I’m coming around to   Miranda’s score, which I’ve given a few spins on my CD player. I’m not a rapper, and my head hurts from all that rhyming (“Aaron Burr, Sir”?) but “Burn” and “It’s Quiet Uptown” are lovely. And “Wait for It” is a Broadway standard in the making. “Hamilton” is also going to win Best Book of a Musical, but I must report that voters find the   “Hamilton: The Revolution” a bit much. That’s the book Manuel   with his Boswell, Jeremy McCarter, about the making of the musical. “I’ve never read such pretentious drivel in my life,” scoffs one voter. “The  !” Still, he’s casting his vote for the “Hamilton” script. Like many, he’s trying to separate the show from the hype, which everyone agrees is out of control. As another voter says: “I love ‘Hamilton.’ But if I have to read one more story about it in the New York Times, I’m canceling my subscription. ” As they say in “The Color Purple”: “Amen!”": "138893",

    "Part of NPR’s Your Money And Your Life series, ”How many of you guys have $1, 200 in your pocket right now?” Victor Robertson’s voice echoes through the auditorium at Ballou High School in Washington, D. C. where 700 students are taking their seats. Robertson is from the city’s Summer Youth Employment Program, which connects 13, 500 young adults with summer jobs at places like CVS and the Department of Parks and Recreation. Robertson explains the difference between a checking account, a savings account and a prepaid debit card. ”If you open a bank account, that’s establishing a relationship with a bank,” Robertson says. ”Your money is safe in a bank. It’s safe and it’s insured.” For many of these students, this summer is the first time they’ll get a paycheck. So, Robertson says it’s time to talk money. Robertson has seen the surveys and heard the statistics that show how woefully uniformed Americans are about their finances. This situation has prompted both federal and state efforts to increase financial education. But there’s a problem: Research suggests financial education may not lead to better financial choices. That doesn’t mean we should stop teaching about money. It just means we need to do it better. JOIN NPR’S ’YOUR MONEY AND YOUR LIFE’ FACEBOOK GROUP, Gregory Hoey says nobody ever sat down ”and talked to me about having an account until I got into the program.” He’s standing off to one side in the auditorium. Gregory did the Summer Youth Employment Program a few years ago. He was a camp counselor at basketball camp. ”I learned a lot. How to basically be a young adult,” the    says. ”Like if there are some shoes or something coming out, I got bigger priorities now.” Gregory’s not buying shoes because he wants to buy a car. But he says he’s still figuring out exactly how to budget and set financial goals. Across town, Richard Cordray wants to help. He’s the director of the U. S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and he’s pushing for more people to talk about money. ”Often families are reluctant to talk about money issues. And, so, if not in the home then where?” he says. ”School is the natural answer.” Seventeen states require students to take some sort of personal finance course, and five states require a semester of financial education. Research commissioned by Cordray’s office looks at many studies that evaluate this type of education. Here is what it found: In the short term, personal finance classes sometimes lead to better scores when students are quizzed on subjects like credit, debt and banking. But these classes don’t necessarily lead to better financial decisions. There’s no clear link between taking personal finance classes and saving more, paying off debts or raising your credit score. But there are techniques that seem to work. First, ”people have to understand where they may need to go and get more information,” Cordray explains. Since financial products are always changing and people are prone to forget the specifics from class lessons, researchers suggest it might make sense to focus on teaching high schoolers how to find the financial facts they’ll one day need. Second, students should get out there and practice. ”Experiential learning,” Cordray says, ”has been shown to be very effective at reaching young people.” Researchers suggest lessons such as following the stock market or getting lots of credit card offers and comparing them. Third, good old math class. Other research has found that requiring high schoolers to take more math leads to better credit, higher returns on investments, and fewer foreclosures. Cordray says math teachers could also make more assignments about money, such as budgeting or calculating compound interest.  Finally, many experts recommend ”  ” financial education. This is when you learn about a very specific topic, just before you do it. So teaching high schoolers about mortgages is not very helpful. But a class on college loans is useful. And a class on credit scores just before a young adult gets a credit card could make a big difference. That’s the model D, C. ’s Summer Youth Employment Program is following. Just before this auditorium full of high schoolers starts earning money, they talk about bank accounts, credit scores and taxes. Tyandra Ames is appreciative. ”I’ve heard credit score before but nobody has explained it to me” before today, she says. Tyandra is a senior at Ballou High School. She has 13 siblings and says that alone has taught her about saving money. ”I learned how to not want so much and not to need so much.” Tyandra is now getting ready for college. She’s about to open her first account and will be living on her own for the first time. She says all of this makes her a bit nervous. She wishes there was a class to explain it all: ”This is what to do. This is what not to do. This is a credit card. This is a debit card. That is your credit score. Like break it down, a little bit.” Tyandra Ames wants a class about money  —   and she wants one that is actually effective.

    "WASHINGTON  —   When President Donald Trump announced he was nominating Rex Tillerson, the former ExxonMobil chief, for secretary of state last December, GOP Sen. Marco Rubio was quick to announce he had “serious concerns” about the nominee’s relationship with Russia. A month later, Rubio repeatedly grilled Tillerson during his confirmation hearing, making it clear the nominee was not giving him the answers he wanted. The Florida senator, who aggressively took on Trump during the end of the GOP presidential primary, told reporters after the hearing he wasn’t going to make the decision on a partisan basis. “I’m prepared to do what’s right,” he said at the time, hinting he was open to voting against Tillerson, despite Republicans holding only a   advantage on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. But on Monday, hours before the committee’s vote on the nominee, Rubio announced in a Facebook post his decision: “  …     despite my reservations, I will support Mr. Tillerson’s nomination in committee and in the full Senate. ” The decision might seem like a complete   based on Rubio’s foreign policy views and his tone of questioning during the hearing, but it’s not surprising and is telling of how the former presidential candidate will deal with   Trump. Sources close to Rubio insist it wasn’t a ploy for attention, as some Rubio critics suggest. They say he made up his mind after a “full court press” from the Trump team. The senator had a   meeting with Tillerson, Vice President Mike Pence and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus last week. The meeting was described as a “blunt conversation” about Tillerson’s answers at the hearing and his relationship with Russia. In the meeting, a source said that Priebus was “transactional,” pressing Rubio on what he wanted in return for the vote, while Rubio argued his opposition was purely based on principle. Other than the meeting, Rubio also got a call from Oracle CEO Safra Catz, urging him to support Tillerson. Catz was part of the Trump transition committee, while Oracle   Larry Ellison was one Rubio’s major supporters during his White House bid. “In the end, I think Marco decided that it was better to be inside the tent than outside,” a source close to Rubio said. “A vote against Tillerson would have reduced his influence on foreign policy matters with the Trump Administration to zero. ” Rubio also asked Tillerson for written responses to more than 100 questions he submitted. He received the answers on Thursday and reviewed them over the weekend before announcing his decision. Under pressure from Trump administration officials and other Republican senators, sources say, the one question that Rubio had to square with was: How could you vote to confirm John Kerry but not vote for Tillerson? That question, at a time when the new president is focused on loyalty and quick to attack members of his own party, was especially hard for Rubio, who is trying to resurrect his political career after a failed presidential bid. Rubio, whom Trump labeled “Lil’ Marco” during the presidential primary, has seen firsthand what angering Trump can lead to. It was also becoming clear that Tillerson’s nomination was going to make it through the Senate with or without Rubio’s support. Last week, Sen. Bob Corker, chairman of the committee, said the Senate would be able to use certain procedures to bring the nomination up for a vote on the floor even if Tillerson failed in committee, making Rubio’s opposition notable, but irrelevant. Support from other foreign policy hawks  —   Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham, who had been siding with Rubio in expressing doubts about Tillerson  —   was also crumbling. Both officially said they would back Tillerson on the Sunday before the committee vote. In his Facebook post, Rubio tried to satisfy both wings of the Republican Party  —   foreign policy hawks looking to him to stand up to Trump and Trump loyalists. Acknowledging that Tillerson’s answers had been “troubling” on issues including his views on Russia and human rights violations, Rubio said he would vote to give the Trump administration a Secretary of State, in order to avoid uncertainty in foreign policy. He also said he would be even tougher on other State Department nominations going forward. “I remain concerned that in the years to come, our country will not give the defense of democracy and human rights the priority they deserve, and will pursue a foreign policy that too often sets aside our values and our historic alliances in pursuit of flawed geopolitical deals,” Rubio wrote. “But in making my decision on his nomination, I must balance these concerns with his extensive experience and success in international commerce, and my belief that the president is entitled to significant deference when it comes to his choices for the cabinet. Given the uncertainty that exists both at home and abroad about the direction of our foreign policy, it would be against our national interests to have this confirmation unnecessarily delayed or embroiled in controversy. ”": "102127",
